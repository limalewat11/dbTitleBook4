The second novel by Kurt Vonnegut.</p><p></p><h2>The Best Recipes in the World</h2><p>With his million-copy bestseller <i>How to Cook Everything,</i> Mark Bittman made the difficult doable. Now he makes the exotic accessible.<br><br>In this highly ambitious, accomplished, globe-spanning work, Bittman gathers the best recipes that people from dozens of countries around the world cook every day. And when he brings his distinctive no-frills approach to dishes that were once considered esoteric, America's home cooks will eagerly follow where they once feared to tread.<br><br>In more than a thousand recipes, Bittman compellingly demonstrates that there are many places besides Italy and France to which cooks can turn for inspiration. In addition to these favorites, he covers Spain, Portugal, Greece, Russia, Scandinavia, the Balkans, Germany, and other European destinations, giving us easy ways to make dishes like Spanish Mushroom and Chicken Paella, Greek Roast Leg of Lamb with Thyme and Orange, Russian Borscht, and Swedish �ppletorte. <br><br>Asian food now rivals European cuisine&#x2019;s popularity, and this book reflects that: It&#x2019;s the first to emphasize European and Asian cuisines equally, with easy-to-follow recipes for favorites like Vietnamese Stir-Fried Vegetables with Nam Pla, Pad Thai, Japanese Salmon Teriyaki, Chinese Black Bean and Garlic Spareribs, and Indian Tandoori Chicken. Nor is the rest of the world ignored: there are hundreds of recipes from North Africa, the Middle East, and Central and South America, too. All will be hits with home cooks looking to add exciting new tastes and cosmopolitan flair to their everyday repertoire. <br><br>Shop locally, cook globally&#x2013;Mark Bittman makes it so easy:<br><br><i>� Hundreds of recipes that can be made ahead or prepared in under 30 minutes<br><br>� Informative sidebars and instructional drawings explain unfamiliar techniques and ingredients<br><br>� Fifty-two international menus, an extensive International Pantry section, and much more make this an essential addition to any cook&#x2019;s shelf</i><br><br><i>The Best Recipes in the World</i> is destined to be a classic that will change the way Americans think about everyday food. It&#x2019;s simply like no other cookbook in the world.</p><p>When Mark Bittman is cooking--in every sense of the word--he gets results without fuss. Author of the almost subversively approachable <i>How to Cook Everything</i>, Bittman takes on big assignments and then delivers the goods. In <i>The Best Recipes in the World</i>, a collection of more than 1,000 international recipes, with winners like Chinese Black Bean and Garlic Spareribs; Pan-Seared Swordfish with Tomatoes, Olives, and Capers; and Stewed Lamb Shanks with Mushrooms and Pasilla Chile Sauce, he's done it again. The selection, which covers cooking from Europe and Asia equally, is all can-do and instantly appealing--readers will want to "cook through" the whole chicken section, for example. But Bittman, a master distiller, also knows when more is more, with one caveat: "I don't mind spending a long time cooking a single dish as long as I don't have to pay too much attention to what's going on," he writes. Thus, even fuller-dress recipes like the Indian Red Fish Stew, Fast and Spicy, and Tea-Smoked Duck or Chicken can work for time-deprived cooks. A dessert section that includes the tempting likes of Orange Custard, Walnut Tart, and Caramelized Pars Poached in Red Wine, caps this incisive collection. <p> Included also are brief but enlightening notes on ingredients and techniques such as "On Pureeing Soups," which compares all approaches thoughtfully. Symbols indicate a recipe's potential to be made ahead or in less than 30 minutes (true of most), among other variables. With a beverage chapter and menu suggestions that are actually useful, the book will appeal to a wide audience, not only for its recipes but as a source of relaxed instruction. It's an exploration of culinary essentials from a true essentialist. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p><p><b>Bestselling author Mark Bittman's </b><i>How to Cook Everything</i> is the standard for basic cookbooks, a five-time award winner that has sold over a million copies.

Outside Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, it's burgers and dogs, and in New Orleans, fragrant blasts of shrimp gumbo bounce off the Superdome. Whichever stadium you visit, you'll find that tailgating is alive, well, and cooking in America. John Madden, an adamant fan of this age-old tradition, helps the cause with his new cookbook, <i>John Madden's Ultimate Tailgating</i>. But be warned: Madden isn't into fancy, white-linen cuisine. These are smash-mouth meals, meant for those willing to drip sauce on their shirts and deal with the heartburn that follows. He starts simple, with recipes like Smoked Prime Rib and Salt-Cured Spit-Roasted Leg of Lamb. Then he ups the ante with Metrodome Horseradish Burgers, Brew Crew Venison Stew, Tabasco Sesame Noodles, and Pork to Taste Like Wild Boar. Each of the 80 stomach-grumbling recipes was subjected to taste tests by hundreds of tailgaters. And if it's good enough for these discerning taste buds, it's good enough for the All-Madden Culinary Team. <i>--Ben Tiffany</i>Popular sports broadcaster Madden blends two of America's favorite subjects?sports and food?in this lighthearted look at feasting off the tailgate.<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>An Echo in the Bone (Outlander)</h2><p><b>A new Outlander novel &#x2014; the seventh &#x2014; from #1 National Bestselling author Diana Gabaldon.</b><br><br>Readers have been waiting with bated breath for the seventh volume in bestselling author Diana Gabaldon&#x2019;s epic Outlander saga &#x2014; a masterpiece of historical fiction featuring Jamie and Claire, from one of the genre&#x2019;s most popular and beloved authors.<br><br>Jamie Fraser, erstwhile Jacobite and reluctant rebel, knows three things about the American rebellion: the Americans will win, unlikely as that seems in 1778; being on the winning side is no guarantee of survival; and he&#x2019;d rather die than face his illegitimate son &#x2014; a young lieutenant in the British Army &#x2014; across the barrel of a gun. Fraser&#x2019;s time-travelling wife, Claire, also knows a couple of things: that the Americans will win, but that the ultimate price of victory is a mystery. What she does believe is that the price won&#x2019;t include Jamie&#x2019;s life or happiness &#x2014; not if she has anything to say.<br><br>Claire&#x2019;s grown daughter Brianna, and her husband, Roger, watch the unfolding of Brianna&#x2019;s parents&#x2019; history &#x2014; a past that may be sneaking up behind their own family.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p><p><b>Diana Gabaldon</b> is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the wildly popular Outlander novels, as well as the related Lord John Grey books,<i> </i>one work of nonfiction, and the Outlander graphic novel <i>The Exile</i>.

William heard the speculations from a group of idlers on the quay nearby, wondering whether it would be seen again.<br><br>&#x201c;Na, him be gone for good,&#x201d; said a ragged man of mixed blood, shaking his head. &#x201c;De ally-gator don&#x2019; take him, de water will.&#x201d;<br><br>A backwoodsman shifted his tobacco and spat into the water in disagreement. &#x201c;No, he&#x2019;s good for another day&#x2013; two, maybe. Them gristly bits what holds the head on, they dry out in the sun. Tighten up like iron. Seen it many a time with deer carcasses.&#x201d;<br><br>William saw Mrs. MacKenzie glance quickly at the harbor, then away. She looked pale, he thought, and maneuvered himself slightly so as to block her view of the men and the brown flood of high tide, though since it <i>was </i>high, the corpse tied to its stake was naturally not visible. The stake was, though&#x2013; a stark reminder of the price of crime. The pirate had been staked to drown on the mudflats several days before, the persistence of his decaying corpse an ongoing topic of public conversation.<br><br>&#x201c;Jem!&#x201d; Mr. MacKenzie called sharply, and lunged past William in pursuit of his son. The little boy, red-haired like his mother, had wandered away to listen to the men&#x2019;s talk, and was now leaning perilously out over the water, clinging to a bollard in an attempt to see the dead pirate.<br><br>Mr. MacKenzie snatched the boy by the collar, pulled him in, and swept him up in his arms, though the boy struggled, craning back toward the swampish harbor.<br><br>&#x201c;I want to see the wallygator eat the pirate, Daddy!&#x201d;<br><br>The idlers laughed, and even MacKenzie smiled a little, though the smile disappeared when he glanced at his wife. He was at her side in an instant, one hand beneath her elbow.<br><br>&#x201c;I think we must be going,&#x201d; MacKenzie said, shifting his son&#x2019;s weight in order better to support his wife, whose distress was apparent. &#x201c;Lieutenant Ransom&#x2013; Lord Ellesmere, I mean&#x201d;&#x2013;he corrected with an apologetic smile at William&#x2013;&#x201c;will have other engagements, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;<br><br>This was true; William was engaged to meet his father for supper. Still, his father had arranged to meet him at the tavern just across the quay; there was no risk of missing him. William said as much, and urged them to stay, for he was enjoying their company&#x2013; Mrs. MacKenzie&#x2019;s, particularly&#x2013; but she smiled regretfully, though her color was better, and patted the capped head of the baby in her arms.<br><br>&#x201c;No, we do have to be going.&#x201d; She glanced at her son, still struggling to get down, and William saw her eyes flicker toward the harbor and the stark pole that stood above the flood. She resolutely looked away, fixing her eyes upon William&#x2019;s face instead. &#x201c;The baby&#x2019;s waking up; she&#x2019;ll be wanting food. It was so lovely to meet you, though. I wish we might talk longer.&#x201d; She said this with the greatest sincerity, and touched his arm lightly, giving him a pleasant sensation in the pit of the stomach.<br><br>The idlers were now placing wagers on the reappearance of the drowned pirate, though by the looks of things, none of them had two groats to rub together.<br><br>&#x201c;Two to one he&#x2019;s still there when the tide goes out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Five to one the body&#x2019;s still there, but the head&#x2019;s gone. I don&#x2019;t care what you say about the gristly bits, Lem, that there head was just a-hangin&#x2019; by a thread when this last tide come in. Next un&#x2019;ll take it, sure.&#x201d;<br><br>Hoping to drown this conversation out, William embarked on an elaborate farewell, going so far as to kiss Mrs. MacKenzie&#x2019;s hand with his best court manner&#x2013; and, seized by inspiration, kissed the baby girl&#x2019;s hand, too, making them all laugh. Mr. MacKenzie gave him rather an odd look, but didn&#x2019;t seem offended, and shook his hand in a most republican manner&#x2013; playing out the joke by setting down his son and making the little boy shake hands as well.<br><br>&#x201c;Have you kilt anybody?&#x201d; the boy inquired with interest, looking at William&#x2019;s dress sword.<br><br>&#x201c;No, not yet,&#x201d; William replied, smiling.<br><br>&#x201c;My grandsire&#x2019;s kilt two dozen men!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jemmy!&#x201d; Both parents spoke at once, and the little boy&#x2019;s shoulders went up around his ears.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, he <i>has</i>!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he is a bold and bloody man, your grandsire,&#x201d; William assured the little boy gravely. &#x201c;The King always has need of such men.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My grandda says the King can kiss his arse,&#x201d; the boy replied matter-of-factly.<br><br>&#x201c;JEMMY!&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. MacKenzie clapped a hand over his outspoken offspring&#x2019;s mouth.<br><br>&#x201c;You <i>know </i>your grandda didn&#x2019;t say that!&#x201d; Mrs. MacKenzie said. The little boy nodded agreeably, and his father removed the muffling hand.<br><br>&#x201c;No. Grannie did, though.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s somewhat more likely,&#x201d; Mr. MacKenzie murmured, obviously trying not to laugh. &#x201c;But we still don&#x2019;t say things like that to soldiers&#x2013; they work for the King.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; said Jemmy, clearly losing interest. &#x201c;Is the tide going out now?&#x201d; he asked hopefully, craning his neck toward the harbor once more.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Mr. MacKenzie said firmly. &#x201c;Not for hours. You&#x2019;ll be in bed.&#x201d;<br><br>Mrs. MacKenzie smiled at William in apology, her cheeks charmingly flushed with embarrassment, and the family took its leave with some haste, leaving William struggling between laughter and dismay.<br><br>&#x201c;Oy, Ransom!&#x201d;<br><br>He turned at his name, to find Harry Dobson and Colin Osborn, two second lieutenants from his regiment, evidently escaped from duty and eager to sample the fleshpots of Wilmington&#x2013; such as they were.<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Dobson looked after the departing group, interested.<br><br>&#x201c;A Mr. and Mrs. MacKenzie. Friends of my father&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, married, is she?&#x201d; Dobson sucked in his cheeks, still watching the woman. &#x201c;Well, make it a bit harder, I suppose, but what&#x2019;s life without a challenge?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Challenge?&#x201d; William gave his diminutive friend a jaundiced look. &#x201c;Her husband&#x2019;s roughly three times your size, if you hadn&#x2019;t noticed.&#x201d;<br><br>Osborn laughed, going red in the face.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s <i>twice </i>his size! She&#x2019;d crush you, Dobby.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And what makes you think I mean to be on the bottom?&#x201d; Dobson inquired with dignity. Osborn hooted.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this obsession of yours with giantesses?&#x201d; William demanded. He glanced at the little family, now nearly out of sight at the end of the street. &#x201c;That woman&#x2019;s nearly as tall as I am!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, rub it in, why don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Osborn, who was taller than Dobson&#x2019;s five feet, but still a head shorter than William, aimed a mock kick at his knee. William dodged it and cuffed Osborn, who ducked and shoved him into Dobson.<br><br>&#x201c;Gennelmen!&#x201d; The menacing cockney tones of Sergeant Cutter brought them up sharp. They might outrank the sergeant, but not one of them would have the nerve to point this out. The entire battalion went in fear of Sergeant Cutter, who was older than God and approximately Dobson&#x2019;s height, but who contained within his diminutive physique the sheer fury of a full-sized volcano on the boil.<br><br>&#x201c;Sergeant!&#x201d; Lieutenant William Ransom, Earl of Ellesmere and senior of the group, drew himself up straight, chin pressed back into his stock. Osborn and Dobson hastily followed his lead, quaking in their boots.<br><br>Cutter strode back and forth in front of them, in the manner of a stalking leopard. You could just see the lashing tail and the preliminary licking of chops, William thought. Waiting for the bite was almost worse than getting it in the arse.<br><br>&#x201c;And where&#x2019;s your troops, then?&#x201d; Cutter snarled. <i>&#x201c;Sirs?&#x201d;<br></i><br>Osborn and Dobson at once began sputtering explanations, but Lieutenant Ransom&#x2013; for once&#x2013; walked on the side of the angels.<br><br>&#x201c;My men are guarding the Governor&#x2019;s Palace, under Lieutenant Colson. I&#x2019;m given leave, Sergeant, to dine with my father,&#x201d; he said respectfully. &#x201c;By Sir Peter.&#x201d;<br><br>Sir Peter Packer&#x2019;s was a name to conjure with, and Cutter abated in mid-spew. Rather to William&#x2019;s surprise, though, it wasn&#x2019;t Sir Peter&#x2019;s name that had produced this reaction.<br><br>&#x201c;Your father?&#x201d; Cutter said, squinting. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Lord John Grey, is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Er . . . yes,&#x201d; William replied cautiously. &#x201c;Do you . . . know him?&#x201d;<br><br>Before Cutter could reply, the door of a nearby tavern opened, and William&#x2019;s father came out. William smiled in delight at this timely appearance, but quickly erased the smile as the sergeant&#x2019;s gimlet gaze fixed on him.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you be a-grinnin&#x2019; at <i>me </i>like an &#x2019;airy ape,&#x201d; the sergeant began, in dangerous tones, but was interrupted by Lord John&#x2019;s clapping him familiarly on the shoulder&#x2013; something none of the three young lieutenants would have done if offered significant money.<br><br>&#x201c;Cutter!&#x201d; Lord John said, smiling warmly. &#x201c;I heard those dulcet tones and said to myself, why damn me if it isn&#x2019;t Sergeant Aloysius Cutter! There can&#x2019;t be another man alive who sounds so much like a bulldog that&#x2019;s swallowed a cat and lived to tell about it.&#x201d;<br><br><i>&#x201c;Aloysius?&#x201d; </i>Dobson mouthed at William, but William merely grunted briefly in response, unable to shrug, as his father had now turned his attention in his direction.<br><br>&#x201c;William,&#x201d; he said, with a cordial nod. &#x201c;How very punctual you are. My apologies for being so late; I was detained.&#x201d; Before William could say anything or introduce the others, though, Lord John had embarked upon a lengthy reminiscence with Sergeant Cutter, reliving high old times on the Plains of Abraham with General Wolfe.<br><br>This allowed the three young officers to relax slightly, which, in Dobson&#x2019;s case, meant a return to his earlier train of thought.<br><br>&#x201c;You said that red-haired poppet&#x2019;s a friend of your father&#x2019;s?&#x201d; he whispered to William. &#x201c;Find out from him where she&#x2019;s staying, eh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Idiot,&#x201d; hissed Osborn. &#x201c;She isn&#x2019;t even pretty! She&#x2019;s long-nosed as&#x2013; as&#x2013; as Willie!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t see as high as her face,&#x201d; Dobson said, smirking. &#x201c;Her tits were right at eye-level, though, and <i>those . . .</i>&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ass!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shh!&#x201d; Osborn stamped on Dobson&#x2019;s foot to shut him up as Lord John turned back to the young men.<br><br>&#x201c;Will you introduce me to your friends, William?&#x201d; Lord John inquired politely. Rather red in the face&#x2013; he had reason to know that his father had acute hearing, despite his artillery experiences&#x2013; William did so, and Osborn and Dobson both bowed, looking rather awed. They hadn&#x2019;t realized who his father was, and William was at once proud that they were impressed, and mildly dismayed that they&#x2019;d discovered Lord John&#x2019;s identity&#x2013; it would be all over the battalion before supper tomorrow. Not that Sir Peter didn&#x2019;t know, of course, but&#x2013;<br><br>He gathered his wits, realizing that his father was taking leave for them both, and returned Sergeant Cutter&#x2019;s salute, hastily but in good form, before hurrying after his father, leaving Dobby and Osborn to their fate.<br><br>&#x201c;I saw you speaking to Mr. and Mrs. MacKenzie,&#x201d; Lord John said casually. &#x201c;I trust they are well?&#x201d; He glanced down the quay, but the MacKenzies had long since disappeared from view.<br><br>&#x201c;Seemed so,&#x201d; Willie said. He was <i>not </i>going to ask where they stayed, but the impression the young woman had made on him lingered. He couldn&#x2019;t say if she was pretty or not; her eyes had struck him, though&#x2013; a wonderful deep blue with long auburn lashes, and fixed on him with a flattering intensity that had warmed the cockles of his heart. Grotesquely tall, of course, but&#x2013; what was he thinking? The woman was married&#x2013; with children! And red-haired, to boot.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve&#x2013; er&#x2013; known them long?&#x201d; he asked, thinking of the startlingly perverse political sentiments that evidently flourished in the family.<br><br>&#x201c;Quite some time. She is the daughter of one of my oldest friends, Mr. James Fraser. Do you recall him, by chance?&#x201d;<br><br>William frowned, not placing the name&#x2013; his father had thousands of friends, how should he . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not an English friend, you don&#x2019;t mean. Was it not a Mr. Fraser that we visited in the mountains, that time when you fell sick of the&#x2013; of the measle?&#x201d; The bottom of his stomach dropped a little, remembering the sheer terror of that time. He had traveled through the mountains in a daze of misery; his mother had died only a month before. Then Lord John had caught the measle, and William had been sure that his father was about to die likewise, leaving him completely alone in the wilderness. There hadn&#x2019;t been room for anything in his mind but fear and grief, and he retained only a jumble of confused impressions from the visit. He had some dim recollection that Mr. Fraser had taken him fishing and been kind to him.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; his father said, with a sidelong smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m touched, Willie.

His cheeks burned with remembered mortification. At least Fraser&#x2019;s daughter hadn&#x2019;t been present to witness his humiliation at the time.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, of course. But&#x2013;&#x201d; His father pressed the handkerchief to his mouth, his shoulders shaking silently.<br><br>&#x201c;Feel free to stop cackling at any point,&#x201d; William said coldly. &#x201c;Where the devil are we going, anyway?&#x201d; They&#x2019;d reached the end of the quay, and his father was leading them&#x2013; still snorting like a grampus&#x2013; into one of the quiet, tree-lined streets, away from the taverns and inns near the harbor.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re dining with a Captain Richardson,&#x201d; his father said, controlling himself with an obvious effort.

Every day &#39;It&#39; will grant each of them a wish that lasts until sunset, often with disastrous consequences. Five Children and It was first published in 1902, and it has remained in print ever since. The Introduction to this edition examines Nesbit&#39;s life and her reading, showing how she was poised between the Victorian world and a new era in which children in literature were no longer mere projections of the adult viewpoint. Sandra Kemp examines how the narrative is structured around the acting out of literary fantasies, which always come down to earth. Nesbit combines wonderfully implausible events with the prosaic and familiar, and Kemp illuminates her exploration of the shifting relationship between imagination, literature, and life.Edith Nesbit (1858&amp;ndash1924) was a children's writer whose most famous novels include The Story of the Treasure Seekers, Five Children and It, and The Enchanted Castle.</p><h2>Planting the Natural Garden</h2><p>Following on the success of Designing with Plants and Dream Plants for the Natural Garden, Piet Oudolf&#39;s landmark first book (co-authored by Henk Gerritsen), is now available in English. Thoroughly updated and revised, including several new chapters and many new photographs, it provides the definitive argument for the &#34;natural garden.&#34; This updated edition of the book that started the &#34;Dutch Wave,&#34; a movement that is now sweeping gardens from Europe to North America, shows how to plant a garden that can look wild but be tame at heart. Hundreds of eye-catching plant combinations are explained in detail and provide ideas for every garden. The authors emphasize how gardeners can create moods and emotional responses with the deft use of themed plantsFoolproof lists and instructions for placing specific plants in particular garden habitats are included, as well as complete growing requirements. As ethereal, even lyrical, as these gardens and plants can seem to the eye, it is important to recognize that Oudolf and Gerritsen have chosen their plants for hardiness and suitability for garden habitats. These are tough plants that do not need to be pampered or coddled. The popularity of the &#34;Dutch Wave,&#34; from England&#39;s Chelsea Garden Show to the healing garden at New York&#39;s World Trade Center has as much to do with the reliability and sturdiness of the plants as it does to their beauty and grace.</p><p>Piet Oudolf&#39;s landmark first book (coauthored by Henk Gerritsen) is now available in English.

As ethereal, even lyrical, as these gardens and plants can seem to the eye, these are tough plants that do not need to be pampered or coddled.Piet Oudolf is a native of Holland and originally studied to be an architect. Instead of designing buildings he became the founder of New Wave planting, a movement which takes inspiration from nature but employs artistic skill in creating planting schemes. As a plantsman, his aim is to emphasize the form, texture, and natural harmony of plants, and as a skilled plant breeder, he creates new varieties for these and other specific design purposes. His style is the result of the influence of various horticultural traditions such as the combination of Dutch formality and naturalistic planting styles.</p><h2>Ponder These Things: Praying with Icons of the Virgin</h2><p>What we call holy in the world &#x2013; a person, a place, a set of words or pictures &#x2013; is so because the completely foreign is brought together with the familiar and the everyday. No one embodies this more than Mary, who literally makes a home for the Creator of all things in her own body and in her own house &#x2013; the strangest reality we can conceive.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ponder These Things</i> invites readers to explore and reflect on the depths of meaning in three classic icons of the Virgin and her Child from the Eastern Christian tradition. Icons have been described as &#x201c;theology in line and color&#x201d; and, in tracing the movement within these icons, The Archbishop of Canterbury discovers the pattern of love that they reveal, a love that invites and embraces us so that we no longer remain as spectators, but find ourselves caught up in the drama that unfolds itself before us.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Icons, says Archbishop Rowan, show us the way.... They help us to cross borders, to enter into a new and transfigured world. And that is exactly what I experienced as I read....

That is what any icon sets out to embody and transmit. We, watching and waiting for Christ to come more fully to birth in us, are waiting for our lives to become &#39;iconic,&#39; to show in their color and line and movement how God acts, Christlike, in us.&#34; -from the Introduction</p><h2>Jacques Pepin&#39;s the Art of Cooking: Superb Recipes that Familiarize You with the Most Important Cooking Techniques, Vol. 1</h2><p>Collects recipes for foods such as veal roast, venison steak, lobster mousse, poached sole, escargot stew, shrimp Creole, and fine-herb omelet</p><p>k volumes which represent the master work of one of the most admired cooking teachers today.</p><h2>The 12 Step Prayer Book: A Collection of Favorite 12 Step Prayers and Inspirational Readings</h2><p>A second edition (with 44 new prayers) of the best-selling book of prayers and inspirations for those seeking just the right words for conversing with their Higher Power or for expressing their innermost thoughts and feelings.<p></p><p>Words of wisdom and inspiration, gleaned from Twelve Step meetings and adapted from common prayers and devotional readings, fill the second edition of this popular prayer book.

Huge swaths of American culture are driven by manic spiritual anxiety and relentless supernatural worry. Radicals and traditionalists, liberals and conservatives, together with politicians, artists, environmentalists, followers of food fads, and the chattering classes of television commentators: America is filled with people frantically seeking confirmation of their own essential goodness. We are a nation desperate to stand on the side of morality--to know that we are righteous and dwell in the light.<br><br>Or so Joseph Bottum argues in <i>An Anxious Age</i>, an account of modern America as a morality tale, formed by its spiritual disturbances. And the cause, he claims, is the most significant and least noticed historical fact of the last fifty years: the collapse of the Mainline Protestant churches that were the source of social consensus and cultural unity. Our dangerous spiritual anxieties, broken loose from the churches that once contained them, now madden everything in American life.<br><br>Updating <i>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</i>, Max Weber's sociological classic, <i>An Anxious Age</i> undertakes two case studies in contemporary social class, adrift in a nation without the religious understandings that gave it meaning. Looking at the college-educated elite he calls "The Poster Children," Bottum sees the post-Protestant heirs of the old Mainline Protestant domination of culture: dutiful descendants who claim the high social position of their Christian ancestors even while they reject their ancestors' Christianity. Turning to "The Swallows of Capistrano," the Catholics formed by the pontificate of John Paul II, Bottum evaluates the early victories--and later defeats--of the attempt to substitute Catholicism for the dying Mainline voice in public life.<br><br>Sweeping across American intellectual and cultural history, <i>An Anxious Age</i> traces the course of national religion and warns about the strange angels and even stranger demons with which we now wrestle. Insightful and contrarian, wise and unexpected, An Anxious Age ranks among the great modern accounts of American culture.<br><br><b>Praise for Joseph Bottum and <i>An Anxious Age</i>:</b><br><br>&nbsp;"<i>An Anxious Age</i> is bound to be viewed as a classic of American sociology--not only because of its vast knowledge of historical facts and personalities, its depth and multiple layers of meaning, but also because of its literary elegance and imaginative structure. Bottum offers a wholly new way of understanding religion in public life today. The magical trick Bottum works when he asks 'Where did the Protestant ethic go?' is nearly breathtaking." <i>--Michael Novak</i><br><br><i></i>"A poet and critic and essayist with a sideline in history and philosophy," Joseph Bottum is attempting "to wrench the true complexity of faith back from the complexity-destroying context of contemporary political debates." --<i>New York Times</i><br><br>"Joseph Bottum is the poetic voice of modern Catholic intellectual life. His work . . . shaped the minds of a generation." --<i>National Review</i><br><br>"One of America's most gifted writers, with a perfect ear and a matchless style." --<i>Andrew Ferguson</i><br><br>"A fierce critical intelligence and a terrific sense of the comedy of errors we call the human condition." --<i>Paul Mariani</i></p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Joseph Bottum</b></p> <p><strong>Q. How did you come up with the idea for <i>An Anxious Age</i>? </strong></p> <p>In some ways, <i>An Anxious Age</i> really began when I was sent out to report on the protestors at Occupy Wall Street&#x2014;and couldn&#x2019;t finish the assignment. I could feel a spiritual anxiety about modern civilization radiating from nearly all of them, but I could find no easy way to explain it. </p> <p>Now, two years later, this book is my answer: Not just those protestors, but nearly everyone today is driven by supernatural concerns, however much or little they realize it. Radicals and traditionalists, liberals and conservatives&#x2014;together with politicians, artists, environmentalists, followers of food fads, and the chattering classes of television commentators: America is filled with people frantically seeking confirmation of their own essential goodness. We are a nation of individuals desperate to stand on the side of morality&#x2014;anxious to know that we are righteous and dwell in the light. </p> <p>The trouble, of course, is that we&#x2019;ve lost any shared cultural notion of what exactly that goodness might entail. </p> <p><strong>Q. The crux of the book is your claim that the most significant and underappreciated fact about <i>all </i>of contemporary America is the collapse of the Mainline Protestant churches over the last fifty years. How did you come to view the decline of Mainline Protestantism as such an influential factor in the shaping of America&#x2019;s cultural landscape? </strong></p> <p>The reasons for the Mainline churches&#x2019; decline are interesting in themselves. Science, capitalism, liberal Protestant religion, the bureaucratic needs of rising nation states&#x2014;all those changes that Max Weber called the &#x201c;elective affinities&#x201d; that created the modern world&#x2014;resulted in a pretty thin metaphysical order. By the late 1800s, most educated Americans probably had no strong belief in any supernatural entities beyond the bare Christian minimum of the individual soul, below, and God, above. </p> <p>Maybe as a result, a hunger for a thicker world, for a supernatural infusion, is written across America in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries&#x2014;from the table-rapping ghosts heard by spiritualists in the 1840s to the popularizing of the Ouija board in the 1910s, and on to our own time. Denied much sustenance in the central rooms of American religion, this spiritual hunger would eventually drain the Mainline churches down to their present cultural weakness. </p> <p>And here&#x2019;s where it really starts to get interesting. Because American history has led us to expect our national spirituality to be explicitly religious, tied to the nation&#x2019;s churches, we often fail to recognize other effects as spiritual. But strange beings were set free to enter the social and political realms by the decay of the churches that were once a primary source of the cultural unity and social manners that we now lack in the United States. </p> <p>I&#x2019;ve gone back more than a century to Max Weber&#x2019;s classic sociological study <i>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</i> to resurrect the notion of &#x201c;spiritual anxiety&#x201d;&#x2014;in an effort to explain what escaped into the public life with the collapse of Mainline Protestantism. What once were religious concerns have fled the churches to become political and social agitations. And across the nation, in liberals and conservatives alike, there lurks a disturbing sense that how we vote is how our souls are saved. </p> <p>Our dangerous spiritual anxieties, in other words, have broken loose from the churches that used to contain them, and they now madden everything in American life. These new supernatural entities&#x2014;or, at least, these new social and political manifestations of the enduring human desire to perceive something supernatural in the world&#x2014;seem to me omnipresent. Think of our willingness to believe that our political opponents are not just wrong but actually evil. Think of the ways we talk about food, weight, and cigarettes, the way we use such concepts as gender, race, and the environment. </p> <p>In politics, culture, art&#x2014;in <i>everything</i>, spirits and demons, angels and demigods, flitter through American public life, ferrying back and forth across our social and political interactions the burdens of our spiritual anxieties. </p> <p><strong>Q. What do you hope to accomplish with the book? What do you hope readers will glean from it? </strong></p> <p>I hope that <i>An Anxious Age</i> will remind the social groups I called the post-Protestant Poster Children and the Catholic Swallows of Capistrano&#x2014;will remind, in fact, all Americans&#x2014;that we are not as far from the traditional forms of American history as we sometimes imagine ourselves. Spiritual concerns still motivate us, and our historical situation is still set by the condition of American Protestantism at any given moment. </p> <p>More, I would like readers to see that Max Weber&#x2019;s kind of sociological awareness of spiritual causes gives a fuller account of human culture than Karl Marx&#x2019;s hard materialism. Purely material causes (economics, geography, even genetics, as some argue) undoubtedly have strong effects, but the spiritual anxieties of an age, together with the available spiritual rewards, have at least as much influence&#x2014;and probably more&#x2014;on the political, moral, and intellectual culture of a society. </p>JOSEPH BOTTUM is one of the nation&#x2019;s most widely published and influential essayists&#x2014;and author of <i>The Christmas Plains</i>, classic reflections on the meaning of Christmas and the American prairie.

McKissack and Fredrick L. McKissack. Afterword by Peter Glassman.<p>When a swallow arrives in Puddleby-on-the-Marsh with the news that the monkeys of Africa are ill and only the doctor who talks with animals can save them, Doctor Dolittle and such good friends as Jip, his loyal dog, and Dab-Dab, his housekeeper duck, face their greatest challenge. Together they must sail to Africa, battle a band of cutthroat pirates, flee across a gorge on a bridge made of acrobatic apes, and convince the king of the beasts that even he must help an animal in need. With nearly fifty full-page pictures from Michael Hague and the McKissacks artful reworking of the dilemma faced by Prince Bumpo, this treasured story is now available in a deluxe edition that all families will want to explore again and again.</p></p><p>Doctor Dolittle--a 19th-century English physician--has never been one for worrying much. Even after his human patients desert him (when one too many sit on one of the doctor's unusual parlor pets), he manages to convert gracefully to animal medicine. Having mastered animal language along the way (with the help of his caustic yet amusing parrot, Polynesia), he has a good head start in his practice. Then, one cold, dark winter night, as the doctor and his pets sit around the fire, a message arrives, via sparrow, from Africa. A terrible epidemic has broken out among the monkeys, and Doctor Dolittle is the only one who can save them. The beneficent physician checks his money box--not a penny left. But the fate of Africa's ailing apes lays squarely on his shoulders. <p> And so begins the delightful, whimsical adventures that are still enthralling readers three quarters of a century after their original 1920 publication. Hugh Lofting, winner of the 1923 Newbery Medal for <i>The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle</i>, has more than a knack for storytelling. His ability to imbue in his characters--human and animal--distinct, unique personalities is remarkable, and his respect for the rights of all who share the planet shines throughout.

The answer may surprise you. Book seven in the best-selling Left Behind series marks the beginning of the second half of the seven-year Tribulation period. In dramatic fashion, readers are exposed to the horrors of God's judgment and the hope of salvation. Rayford, Buck, Chloe, and the rest of the Tribulation Force find themselves at the center of heart-stopping action. Number one on the <i>New York Times</i> Best Sellers List for four weeks.</p><p>The Antichrist is dead... or is he? The city of Chicago lies in ruins, the safe house is blown, and the Global Community police are hot on the heels of the Tribulation Force. And who assassinated Nicolae Carpathia?<p> It's a formidable challenge to keep the attention of an audience midway through a projected 12-volume series, but with their trademark blend of humor and gripping suspense, authors Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye continue to captivate readers with <i>The Indwelling</i>, the seventh installment of the Left Behind series.</p><p> Carpathia's funeral takes a hair-raising turn for the 4 million people who attend. Over the crowd looms the centerpiece of a new world religion, a 24-foot bronze statue of Carpathia, belching black smoke and demanding obedience. Woven through the fast-paced drama are the ongoing stories of people struggling amid the end-times mayhem: Chloe Williams wrestles with the moral implications of killing her toddler Kenny to avoid having him fall into enemy hands; her father Rayford Steele is brought face-to-face with the consequences of his pride. Dr. Chaim Rosenzweig, a prominent Jewish Israeli statesman, ponders a conversion to Christianity. </p><p> The strength of the series comes from Jenkins's ability to keep the action moving and readers caring about the characters. And there's a hook: The end of <i>The Indwelling</i> promises, "If the last three and a half years are your idea of tribulation, wait until you endure the Great Tribulation." The bad news is just beginning. But, the Tribulation Force believes, good news is also on the way. <i>--Cindy Crosby</i></p><b>Jerry B.

Check your local listings for airtimes.</b></p> <p><b>The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous &amp; Broke</b> is financial expert Suze Orman's answer to a generation's cry for help. They're called "Generation Debt" and "Generation Broke" by the media &#x2014; people in their twenties and thirties who graduate college with a mountain of student loan debt and are stuck with one of the weakest job markets in recent history. The goals of their parents' generation &#x2014; buy a house, support a family, send kids to college, retire in style &#x2014; seem absurdly, depressingly out of reach. They live off their credit cards, may or may not have health insurance, and come up so far short at the end of the month that the idea of saving money is a joke. This generation has it tough, without a doubt, but they're also painfully aware of the urgent need to take matters into their own hands.</p> <p><b>The Money Book</b> was written to address the specific financial reality that faces young people today and offers a set of real, not impossible solutions to the problems at hand and the problems ahead. Concisely, pragmatically, and without a whiff of condescension, Suze Orman tells her young, fabulous &amp; broke readers precisely what actions to take and why. Throughout these pages, there are icons that direct readers to a special YF&amp;B domain on Suze's website that offers more specialized information, forms, and interactive tools that further customize the information in the book. Her advice at times bucks conventional wisdom (did she just say use your credit card?) and may even seem counter-intuitive (pay into a retirement fund even though your credit card debt is killing you?), but it's her honesty, understanding, and uncanny ability to anticipate the needs of her readers that has made her the most trusted financial expert of her day.</p> <p>Over the course of ten chapters that can be consulted methodically, step-by-step or on a strictly need-to-know basis, Suze takes the reader past broke to a secure place where they'll never have to worry about revisiting broke again. And she begins the journey with a bit of overwhelmingly good news (yes, there really is good news): Young people have the greatest asset of all on their side &#x2014; time.</p></p><p>If you are tired of struggling to make ends meet but don't know a 401(k) from Special K, this book is for you. Aimed specifically at "Generation Broke"--those in their twenties and thirties who are working yet buried in credit card debt and student loans--this user-friendly guide offers a clear introduction to practical investing and money management techniques that can turn even a dismal financial situation around. Bestselling author Suze Orman has a knack for taking the fear out of money matters, and in <i>The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous &amp;: Broke</i>, she shows readers how to set priorities and achieve goals, whether it is to buy a house or save for retirement or pay for a child's education. She also offers inspiration to readers to face their financial problems and get started on a solution. After all, there is good news: young people still have the time to correct problems so that they will never be broke again. Readers who find terms such as diversification and IRA rollover scary--or worse, unimportant--will learn much from this book. <p> In these pages, Orman clearly and succinctly explains what a FICO score is and why it's so important, offers the lowdown on stocks and mutual funds, provides career advice, and offers lots of tips on dealing with student loan debt, saving money even when times are tight, debt consolidation strategies, and the safest way for newlyweds to merge their finances. She also offers information on credit cards, including why canceling cards is not a good idea, when it makes sense to use them, and the best strategies for paying them off. It may not be the only money book you'll ever need, but it's an excellent place to start. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i> </p><p> </p><p><strong>All About Suze Orman</strong> </p><p> <i>The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous &amp; Broke</i> is financial expert Suze Orman's answer to a generation's cry for help.

Embittered and broken, his body reclaimed from the grave and his spirit from the care of his bond-wolf Nighteyes, Fitz awakens to a world where everything he once held dear is in ruins. King Shrewd is dead; Prince Regal has claimed the throne and rules the kingdom with a cruel and selfish negligence. Molly has deserted him for parts unknown. Queen Kettricken and her unborn child have fled to the mountains with the Fool, Verity is lost seeking the elusive Elderlings, and Fitz's presumed death forever bars him from Buckkeep. The only companions he had left in his solitude are Chade and Burrich, who wrestle him reluctantly back to humanity after his sojourn in Nighteyes' mind.<br>But angry with the lot Fate has cast him, Fitz drives away even these loyal companions, and for the first time faces his life on his own, without anyone to guide or lead him.

Without guidance, though, he botches the attempt, and an urgent sending by Verity to save him leaves Fitz imprinted with the burning imperative to find and aid his true king in his quest to aid the land.<br>Eventually fighting his way through to the mountains, he rejoins Kettricken and the Fool in a quest for Verity--and there in the Skill-shadowed hills, he discovers an ancient power and a mysterious riddle, whose answer may well change the fate of the Six Duchies forever....</p><p>"Superbly written, wholly satisfying, unforgettable: better than any fantasy trilogy in print--including mine!"--Melanie Rawn <br> <br>"With shimmering language and the alluring garb of Faerie, Hobb concludes her Farseer trilogy with this immense coming-of-age novel." <i>--Publishers Weekly</i> <br> <br> <br> <i>From the Paperback edition.</i>Robin Hobb is the author of the Farseer Trilogy and the Liveship Traders Trilogy.

An active supporter of anti-Roman activity, he became governor of Galilee, a post he held with honor and valor until Galilee was taken by the Romans in a.d. 67. He won the favor of the Roman general Vespasian, whose name---Flavius---he took as his own and through whose patronage he later became a Roman citizen. Although often criticized for becoming a supporter of Rome, in his work Against Apion he passionately defends Jewish religion and culture. Josephus wrote both in Greek and in Hebrew. His writings are neither remarkably fine representatives of classical culture nor the product of deep learning in Jewish literature and history. They do, however, tell the reader a great deal not known from other sources. The Jewish War (75--79), based to a great extent on what Josephus himself saw, heard, and experienced, describes the tragic events of the Jewish revolt against Rome. Antiquities of the Jews (93) covers the history of the Jews from creation to the war with Rome, with special attention given to the Maccabees and the dynasty of Herod.</p><h2>Picasso &amp; Lump: A Dachshund's Odyssey</h2><p>The little-known story of Pablo Picasso and his lovable dog Lump, who is immortalized in many of Picasso&#39;s acclaimed works of art.</p><p>David Douglas Duncan was an acclaimed combat photographer for Life magazine for much of his life.

With the rise in the interest in the occult, and the ?spiritism? today, this book should be in every Christian?s library.</p><p>The Reverend Clarence Larkin was one of the most widely influential pop theologians of the early twentieth century, and his works remain intriguing explorations of Christian philosophy today. <p> First published in 1921, this fascinating book explores the depiction of angels, demons, and other spirits in the Bible, and features illustrations of "Satan's Throne," "Angels Appearing to Abraham," "Christ Casting Out a Demon," "The Witch of Endor," and more. Readers in religion, mythology, and classic literature will be riveted. </p><p> Also available from Cosimo Classics: Larkin's The Second Coming of Christ, Rightly Dividing the Word, and The Book of Revelation.</p>American Baptist pastor and author CLARENCE LARKIN (1850-1924) was born in Pennsylvania, and later set up his ministry there. He wrote extensively and popularly on a wide range of Biblical and theological matters.</p><h2>Holiness: God&#39;s Plan for Fullness of Life</h2><p>Contends that a fear of God is the only way to avoid sin, identifying an epidemic in holinessless in the Church today while inviting readers to experience true revival by looking inward and understanding God&#39;s standards for living a holy life.</p><p>Henry Blackaby is the author of over a dozen books, including the bestselling Experiencing God Bible studies. Dr. Blackaby is a graduate of the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. He has completed his Th.M. degree from Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary. He has also received four honorary degrees and is now serving as the president of Henry Blackaby Ministries.This title is slightly misleading. HOLINESS is not about righteousness or purity of spirit, but rather the need to fear and avoid sin. An old-fashioned jeremiad, it judges the community of the faithful and points out how they've strayed from God's path. The work will appeal to a limited audience; even many fundamentalist Christians will take issue with some of Blackaby's judgments. His stance in no way reflects upon Mel Foster's superior delivery. Foster understands the rhythms of the pulpit and the rhythms of this text in particular. His narration moves smoothly back and forth between a measured pace and a rousing call to salvation, and can powerfully evoke both anger and compassion.

Spanning the Renaissance, Reformation, Exploration, and some early American history, this volume explores the backdrop to and the significance surrounding the time-honored contributions found in art, music, literature, science, and philosophy of this rich era. Unlike Volumes I and II, Volume III has been separated by the publishers into two beautiful books! The Student Reader now contains 84 stirring lessons written by Linda Lacour Hobar in a colorful, easy-to-hold hardback. The reader is a stand alone world history text for all ages to enjoy. But for those who wish to delve deeper, you will want to consider The Mystery of History (Volume III) Companion Guide: curriculum and student activities. This black and white paperback guide book, written also by Linda Lacour Hobar, will contain these familiar and popular components of The Mystery of History series: pretests; hands-on/research activities for younger, middle, and older students; memory card ideas; bi-weekly quizzes and exercises; timeline helps; maps; supplemental book lists; and more. (Though it is recommended that Volumes I and II be studied prior to this volume, it is not necessary. Volume III can stand alone as a full course of Renaissance/Reformation history.)</p><p></p><h2>The Hebrew Yeshua vs. the Greek Jesus</h2><p>An astonishing realization has recently gripped the Christian world: "Jesus Christ" was not a blond-haired, blue-eyed Gentile. Yeshua of Nazareth was raised in an observant Jewish family in a culture where the Torah (five books of Moses) was the National Constitution. Yeshua's teachings, which supposedly form the basis for Western Christianity, are now filtered through 2000 years of traditions born in ignorance of the land, language, and culture of the Bible. The issues over which Yeshua wrestled with the Pharisees are simply not understood by modern Christians; nor are his most important instructions followed by those who claim to be his disciples. <p>Former Pharisee, Nehemia Gordon, a Dead Sea Scrolls scholar and Semitic language expert, explores the ancient Hebrew text of the Gospel of Matthew from manuscripts long hidden away in the archives of Jewish scribes. Gordon's research reveals that the more "modern" Greek text of Matthew, from which the Western world's versions were translated, depicts "another Jesus" from the Yeshua portrayed in the ancient Hebrew version of Matthew. Gordon explains the life-and-death conflict Yeshua had with the Pharisees as they schemed to grab the reins of Judaism in the first century, and brings that conflict into perspective for both Jew and Christian alike.</p></p><p>Nehemia Gordon holds a degree in Biblical Studies and Archaeology from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Fluent in Hebrew, Gordon has worked extensively with ancient manuscripts and on the publication and translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Today, he divides his time between lecturing on Tanach and Hebrew New Testament topics, teaching Biblical Hebrew to private individuals and small groups, and continuing his research on the Hebrew sources of the New Testament.Gordon places Yeshua into his Hebraic context and allows Yeshua's own words to sparkle within their original Semitic setting! -- <i>Avi Ben Mordechai, Preface</i><br><br>Yeshua's brutally honest words in the Hebrew version of Matthew are nothing short of revolutionary for the believer. -- <i>Michael Rood, Introduction</i></p><h2>Findus at Christmas (Findus and Pettson)</h2><p>It is the day before Christmas Eve and there is lots to do but disaster strikes when Pettson sprains his ankle.

As Moe came to terms with his own illness, he began to see similar patterns of behavior and coping mechanisms surfacing in conversations with others, including high-profile comedians who&#x2019;d struggled with the disease. Moe saw that there was tremendous comfort and community in open dialogue about these shared experiences?and that humor had a unique power. Thus was born the podcast The Hilarious World of Depression.</p><p>Inspired by the immediate success of the podcast, Moe has written a remarkable investigation of the disease, part memoir of his own journey, part treasure trove of laugh-out-loud stories and insights drawn from years of interviews with some of the most brilliant minds facing similar challenges. Throughout the course of this powerful narrative, depression&#x2019;s universal themes come to light, among them, struggles with identity, lack of understanding of the symptoms, the challenges of work-life, self-medicating, the fallout of the disease in the lives of our loved ones, the tragedy of suicide, and the hereditary aspects of the disease.

He lives in New Mexico.Starred Review. Abraham (the Seasons of War quartet) starts this rich, exciting, and fresh epic fantasy series opener in a fairly standard fashion: an orphaned girl and a once great general escape from a city under siege with the help of a traveling theater troupe. But that's where the clich�s end, for Marcus Wester would far rather guard humble caravans than cruel kings, and Cithrin bel Sarcour's loyalty is not to her long-dead noble parents but to the Medean Bank that took her in. Cithrin and Marcus must smuggle the treasury of the lost city of Vanai through a war zone in which every army seeks new sources of funds and every king wants them dead. With a deft and light hand, Abraham questions and explores the fantasy-world assumptions that most authors take for granted, telling an enjoyable and genuinely innovative adventure story along the way.

The four rowers wielded their oars carefully, raising them only a few centimeters from the water at the end of each stroke so that the noise of drops splashing back into the sea was kept to a minimum. They were Erak&#x2019;s most experienced oarsmen and they were used to the task of approaching an enemy coast stealthily.</p><p>And during raiding season, all coasts were enemy coasts. </p><p>Such was their skill that the loudest sound was the <i>lap-lap-lap </i>of small ripples along the wooden hull. In the bow, Svengal and two other crew members crouched fully armed, peering ahead to catch sight of the dim line where the water met the beach. </p><p>The lack of surf might make their approach easier but a little extra noise would have been welcome, Svengal thought. Plus white water would have made the line of the beach easier to spot in the dimness. Then he saw the beach and held up his hand, fist clenched. </p><p>Far astern, at the steering oar, Erak watched his second in command as he revealed five fingers, then four, then three as he measured off the distance to the sand. </p><p>&#x201c;In oars.&#x201d; </p><p>Erak spoke the words in a conversational tone, unlike the bellow he usually employed to pass orders. In the center section of the wolfship, his bosun, Mikkel, relayed the orders. The four oars lifted out of the water as one, rising quickly to the vertical so that any excess water would fall into the ship and not into the sea, where it would make more noise. A few seconds later, the prow of the ship grated softly against the sand. Erak felt the vibrations of the gentle contact with the shore through the deck beneath his feet. </p><p>Svengal and his two companions vaulted over the bow, landing catlike on the wet sand. Two of them moved up the beach, fanning out to scan the country on either side, ready to give warning of any possible ambush. Svengal took the small beach anchor that another sailor lowered to him. He stepped twenty paces up the beach, strained against the anchor rope to bring it tight and drove the shovel-shaped fluke into the firm sand. </p><p><i>Wolfwind, </i>secured by the bow, slewed a little to one side under the pressure of the gentle breeze. </p><p>&#x201c;Clear left!&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Clear right!&#x201d; </p><p>The two men who had gone onshore called their reports now. There was no need for further stealth. Svengal checked his own area of responsibility, then added his report to theirs. </p><p>&#x201c;Clear Ahead.&#x201d;</p><p>On board, Erak nodded with satisfaction. He hadn&#x2019;t expected any sort of armed reception on the beach but it always paid to make sure. That was why he had been such a successful raider over the years&#x2014;and why he had lost so few of his crewmen. </p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; he said, lifting his shield from the bulwark and hefting it onto his left arm. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d; </p><p>He quickly strode the length of the wolfship to the bow, where a boarding ladder had been placed over the side. Shoving his heavy battleax through the leather sling on his belt, he climbed easily over the bulwark and down to the beach. His crewmen followed, forming up behind him. There was no need for orders. They had all done this before, many times. </p><p>Svengal joined him. </p><p>&#x201c;No sign of anyone here, chief,&#x201d; he reported. </p><p>Erak grunted. &#x201c;Neither should there be. They should all be busy at Alty Bosky.&#x201d; </p><p>He pronounced the name in his usual way&#x2014;careless of the finer points of Iberian pronunciation. The town in question was actually Alto Bosque, a relatively unimportant market town some ten kilometers to the south, built on the high, wooded hill from which it derived its name. </p><p>The previous day, seven of his crew had taken the skiff and landed there, carrying out a lightning raid on the market before they retreated to the coast. Alto Bosque had no garrison and a rider from the town had been sent to Santa Sebilla, where a small force of militia was maintained. Erak&#x2019;s plan was to draw the garrison away to Alto Bosque while he and his men plundered Santa Sebilla unhindered. </p><p>Santa Sebilla was a small town, too. Probably smaller than Alto Bosque. But, over the years, it had gained an enviable reputation for the quality of the jewelry that was designed and crafted there. As time went on, more and more artisans and designers were drawn to Santa Sebilla and it became a center for fine design and craftsmanship in gold and precious stones. </p><p>Erak, like most Skandians, cared little for fine design and craftsmanship. But he cared a lot about gold and he knew there was a disproportionate amount of it in Santa Sebilla&#x2014;far more than would normally be found in a small town such as this. The community of artists and designers needed generous supplies of the raw materials in which they worked&#x2014;gold and silver and gemstones. Erak was a fervent believer in the principle of redistribution of wealth, as long as a great amount of it was redistributed in his direction, so he had planned this raid in detail for some weeks. </p><p>He checked behind him. The anchor watch of four men were standing by the bow of <i>Wolfwind, </i>guarding it while the main party went inland. He nodded, satisfied that everything was ready. </p><p>&#x201c;Send your scouts ahead,&#x201d; he told Svengal. The second in command gestured to the two men to go ahead of the main raiding party. </p><p>The beach rose gradually to a low line of scrubby bushes and trees. The scouts ran to this line, surveyed the country beyond, then beckoned the main party forward. The ground was flat here, but some kilometers inland, a range of low hills rose from the plain. The first rose-colored rays of the sun were beginning to show about the peaks. They were behind schedule, Erak thought. He had wanted to reach the town before sunup, while people were still drowsy and longing for their beds, as yet reluctant to accept the challenges of a new day. </p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s pace it up,&#x201d; he said tersely and the group settled into a steady jog behind him, moving in two columns. The scouts continued to range some fifty meters in advance of the raiding party. Erak could already see that there was nowhere a substantial party of armed men could remain hidden. Still, it did no harm to be sure. Waved forward by the scouts, they crested a low rise and there, before them, stood Santa Sebilla. </p><p>The buildings were made of clay bricks, finished in whitewash. Later in the day, under the hot Iberian sun, they would glisten and gleam an almost blinding white. In the predawn light they looked dull and gray and mundane. The town had been built with no particular plan in mind, instead growing over the years so that houses and warehouses were placed wherever their owners chose to build them. The result was a chaotic mass of winding alleys, outlying buildings and twisting, formless streets. But Erak ignored the jumble of houses and shops. He was looking for the repository&#x2014;a large building set to one side of the town, where the gold and jewels were stored. </p><p>And there it was. Larger than the others, with a substantial brass-bound wooden door. Normally, Erak knew, there would be a guard in place. But it seemed his diversion had achieved the result he wanted and the local militia were absent. The only possible resistance could come from a small castle set on a cliff a kilometer away from the town itself. There would possibly be armed men there. But the castle was the home of a minor Iberian nobleman and its location here was a mere coincidence. Knowing the snobbish and superior nature of the Iberian nobility, Erak guessed that the castle lord and his people had as little to do with the common tradesmen of Santa Sebilla as possible. They might buy from them, but they wouldn&#x2019;t mix with them or be eager to protect them in an emergency. </p><p>They headed for the repository. As they passed a side street, a sleepy townsman emerged, leading a donkey loaded with what seemed to be an impossibly heavy stack of firewood. For a few seconds, head down and still half asleep, the man failed to notice the force of grim-faced, armed sea wolves. Then his eyes snapped open, his jaw followed suit and he froze in place, staring at them. From the corner of his eye, Erak saw two of his men start to detach from the main body. But the firewood seller could do them little harm. </p><p>&#x201c;Leave him,&#x201d; he ordered and the men dropped back into line. </p><p>Galvanized by the sound of Erak&#x2019;s voice, the man dropped the donkey&#x2019;s halter and took off back into the narrow alleyway from which he had emerged. They heard the soft sound of his bare feet flapping on the hard earth as he put as much distance between himself and the raiders as he could. </p><p>&#x201c;Get that door open,&#x201d; Erak ordered. </p><p>Mikkel and Thorn stepped forward. Mikkel, whose preferred weapon was a sword, borrowed an ax from one of the other sea wolves and together, he and Thorn attacked the heavy door. They were Erak&#x2019;s two most reliable warriors, and he nodded appreciatively at the economy of effort with which they reduced the door to matchwood, placing alternate ax strokes precisely where they would do the most good, each building on the damage the other had caused. The two men were best friends. They always fought together in the shield wall, each trusting the other to protect his back and sides. Yet they were a contrast in body shapes. Mikkel was taller and leaner than the average Skandian. But he was powerful and hard muscled. And he had the reflexes of a cat. </p><p>Thorn was slightly shorter than his friend, but much wider in the shoulders and chest. He was one of the most skilled and dangerous warriors Erak had ever seen. Erak often thought that he would hate to come up against Thorn in battle. He&#x2019;d never seen an opponent who had survived such an encounter. Belying his heavy build, Thorn could also move with blinding speed when he chose.</p><p>Erak roused himself from his musing as the door fell in two shattered halves. </p><p>&#x201c;Get the gold,&#x201d; he ordered and his men surged forward. </p><p>It took them half an hour to load the gold and silver into sacks. They took only as much as they could carry and they left easily the same amount behind. </p><p>Maybe another time, Erak thought, although he knew no subsequent raid would be as easy or as bloodless as this one. In retrospect, he wished he&#x2019;d caught hold of the firewood seller&#x2019;s donkey. The little animal could have carried more of the gold back to the ship for them. </p><p>The town was awake now and nervous faces peered at them from behind windows and around street corners. But these were not warriors and none were willing to face the fierce-looking men from the north. Erak nodded, satisfied, as the last of his men, each laden with two small but heavy sacks, emerged from the repository. He breathed a small sigh of satisfaction. It had been easy, he thought. Easier than he had expected. </p><p>Laden as they were, they couldn&#x2019;t maintain their previous jog as they followed the path through the scrubby undergrowth back to the beach. At least a dozen of the townspeople followed them, as if unwilling to let their gold and jewels simply disappear from sight. But they kept their distance, watching in impotent fury as the sea wolves carried away their booty. </p><p>&#x201c;Thorn, Mikkel, bring up the rear. Let me know if there&#x2019;s any change,&#x201d; Erak said. It would be all too easy to become complacent about the men shadowing their footsteps, and so miss any new threat that might arise.</p><p>The two men nodded and handed their sacks of loot to other crew members, then faded to the back of the column. </p><p>They marched some twenty meters behind the main party, turning continually to keep the following townspeople in sight. Once, Thorn faked a charge at a couple who he felt had come too close, and they scampered hurriedly back to a safe distance. </p><p>&#x201c;Rabbits,&#x201d; said Mikkel dismissively. </p><p>Thorn grinned and was about to reply when he caught sight of movement behind the straggle of townspeople. His grin faded. </p><p>&#x201c;Looks like we&#x2019;ve got some rabbits on horseback,&#x201d; he said. The</p><p>two raiders stopped to face the rear. </p><p>Trotting toward them, following the rough track through the undergrowth, were five horsemen. The newly risen sun gleamed off their armor and the points of the spears they all carried. They were still some distance behind the raiders but they were coming up fast. The two companions could hear the faint jingle of their horses&#x2019; harness and their equipment. </p><p>Thorn glanced back to the main party of raiders. They were about to enter a narrow defile that led down to the last stretch of open ground to the beach. He let out a piercing whistle and saw Erak stop and look back. The rest of the party continued to move as quickly as they could. </p><p>Thorn pointed to the riders. Uncertain whether Erak could see the new enemy, he held up his right hand, with five fingers extended, then brought it down in a clenched fist close by his shoulder&#x2014; the signal for &#x201c;enemy.&#x201d; He pointed again to the riders. </p><p>He saw Erak wave acknowledgment, then point at the entrance to the defile, where the last of his men were just passing through. Thorn and Mikkel both grunted in understanding. </p><p>&#x201c;Good idea,&#x201d; Mikkel said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll hold them off at the entrance.&#x201d; </p><p>The high rock walls and narrow space would encumber the horsemen. It would also prevent them from flanking and encircling the two sea wolves. They&#x2019;d be forced into a frontal attack. Normally, that might be a daunting prospect, but these were two experienced and deadly fighters, each secure in his own skills and those of his companion. </p><p>They both knew that Erak would not abandon them to this new danger. Once the gold was safely at the ship, he&#x2019;d send men back to help them. Their job was only to buy time, not to sacrifice themselves so the others could escape. And both men felt confident that they could hold off a few country-bumpkin horsemen. </p><p>They doubled their pace, covering the ground to the defile. Behind them, they heard a ragged cheer from the townspeople as they saw the raiders seemingly running for their lives ahead of the avenging horsemen, who urged their horses to a gallop, determined to catch these interlopers before they could escape into the narrow gully. </p><p>The two warriors had no intention of escaping. Rather, as they reached the defile, Mikkel and Thorn turned and drew their weapons, swinging them experimentally as they faced the approaching riders. </p><p>Like most Skandians, Thorn favored a heavy, single-bladed battleax as his principal weapon. Mikkel was armed with a long sword. Both of them wore horned helmets and carried large wooden shields, borne on the left arm, with a heavy center boss of metal and reinforcing metal strips around the edges....</p></p><h2>Twice Tempted by a Rogue (Stud Club Trilogy)</h2><p>The daring members of the Stud Club are reckless gamblers and no strangers to risk&#x2014;until love raises the stakes in <b>Twice Tempted by a Rogue.<br></b>&nbsp;<br>Luck is a double-edged sword for brooding war hero Rhys St. Maur. His death wish went unanswered on the battlefield, while fate allowed the murder of his good friend in the elite gentlemen&#x2019;s society known as the Stud Club. Out of options, Rhys returns to his ancestral home on the moors of Devonshire, expecting anything but a chance at redemption in the arms of a beautiful innkeeper who dares him to take on the demons of his past&#x2014;and the sweet temptation of a woman&#x2019;s love.<br><br>Meredith Maddox believes in hard work, not fate, and romance isn&#x2019;t part of her plan. But when Rhys returns, battle-scarred, world-weary, and more dangerously attractive than ever, the lovely widow is torn between determination and desire.

She makes her home in Southern California, where she shares a cozy, cluttered bungalow with her husband, their two children, and a dog.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br>Rhys St. Maur, newly Lord Ashworth, was a broken man.<br><br>Literally.<br><br>By the age of twenty, he&#x2019;d fractured his left arm twice&#x2014;once in a schoolboy brawl at Eton, and then again during an army training drill. Cracked ribs . . . he&#x2019;d lost count of those. Fists driving through bar- room haze to connect with his face had snapped the cartilage in his nose a few times, leaving him with a craggy profile&#x2014;one that was not improved by his myriad scars. Since sometime around his thirtieth birthday, the little finger on his right hand just plain refused to bend. And in damp weather like this, his left knee throbbed with memories of marching through the Pyrenees and surviving the Battle of Nivelle unscathed, only to catch a Basque farmer&#x2019;s hoe to the knee the next morning, when he left camp for a predawn piss.<br><br>That left knee was on fire tonight, sizzling with pain as Rhys trudged through the granite heart of Devonshire, leading his horse down the darkened road. The moisture in the air kept dithering between fog and rain, and the night was thick with its indecision. He couldn&#x2019;t see but a few feet in front of him, which was why he&#x2019;d decided to dismount and lead his horse on foot. Between the poor visibility and the surrounding terrain littered with chunks of stone and boot-sucking bogs, the risk of fatal injury was too great.<br><br>For the horse, that was. Rhys wasn&#x2019;t in the least concerned for himself. In fact, if he thought this godforsaken moor had any chance of claiming his own life, he&#x2019;d cheerfully saddle his gelding and charge off into the gloom.<br><br>But it wouldn&#x2019;t work. It never had. He&#x2019;d just end up with a lamed or dead horse, another broken rib perhaps, and the same curse that had haunted him since boyhood: unwanted, undeserved, and wholly wasted good luck.<br><br>No matter what misfortune befell him, this or any night, Rhys St. Maur was doomed to survive it.<br><br>The wind&#x2019;s low moan played his spine like a fiddle string. Behind him, the gelding balked. With a reassuring shush for the beast&#x2019;s benefit, Rhys marched on, turning up the collar of his coat to keep out the mist.<br><br>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil . . .<br><br>He&#x2019;d been walking through this valley for a long, long time. Trod so far into death&#x2019;s shadow he&#x2019;d felt his feet turning to dust in his boots, the breath in his lungs burning acrid as sulfur. A living ghost, that&#x2019;s what he was. He&#x2019;d returned from war to a newly inherited barony, and his sole duty now was to haunt the English aristocracy. Hulk awkwardly in the corners of their parties, terrify their delicate young ladies, and cause the gentlemen to rub their temples self-consciously as they tried not to stare at the gnarled scar marring his own.<br><br>As Rhys rounded a sharp curve in the road, a vaguely familiar sight emerged from the gloom. If he&#x2019;d read his landmarks right, this had to be it. The tiny village of Buckleigh-in-the-Moor. At this distance, just a meager constellation of amber pinpricks against the black night.<br><br>The horse, scenting straw and safety, picked up his pace. Soon the cluster of stone and cob buildings came into focus. It must not be as late as it felt. A fair number of the cottages still showed light through their windows&#x2014;yellow eyes peering out from beneath thatched-roof hats.<br><br>He halted in the center of the road. Wiping the moisture from his eyes, he squinted in the direction of the old inn. Fourteen years he&#x2019;d been gone, but the same sign still creaked on its chains above the door. It read, in retouched gilt letters, The Three Hounds. Below the words, the pictured trio of dogs remained at perpetual attention. A burst of coarse laughter rattled one of the inn&#x2019;s unshuttered windows. Old Maddox was still doing a brisk trade, then.<br><br>Though his mount stamped with impatience, Rhys stood motionless facing the inn. Finally, he tilted his face to the sky above it. Fog covered the village like cotton wool, obscuring the craggy tors that loomed high on the steep slope beyond. Without their ominous shadow, the village of Buckleigh-in-the-Moor&#x2014;this hated place he&#x2019;d been running from since before he could remember&#x2014; almost appeared . . . quaint. Charming. Welcoming.<br><br>And at that fool notion, Rhys almost laughed aloud.<br><br>This place would not welcome him.<br><br>No sooner had he formed the thought, than the inn&#x2019;s front door swung out on its hinges, tossing a shaft of light and warmth into the courtyard. The dull wave of laughter he&#x2019;d heard earlier now swelled to a roar of excitement&#x2014;one punctuated with a crash of breaking glass.<br><br>&#x201c;You bastard son of a bitch!&#x201d;<br><br>Ah, now that was the sort of reception he&#x2019;d been expecting. But unless the old superstitions were true and some witch had foretold his arrival, Rhys knew the words couldn&#x2019;t have been meant for him. No one was likely to recognize him at all&#x2014;he&#x2019;d been just seventeen years old when he&#x2019;d been here last.<br><br>Pulled forward by curiosity and the smells of ale and peat smoke, he approached the open door, stopping just outside.<br><br>The tavern was cramped, and much as Rhys remembered it. Just big enough to hold a small bar, a half-dozen tables, a mismatched assortment of chairs and stools, and&#x2014;on this particular occasion&#x2014;complete pandemonium.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it! Pound &#x2019;im good!&#x201d;<br><br>Two neckless apes faced off in the center of the room, spitting and circling one another as the onlookers pushed aside tables and chairs. The taller of the two brutes took a clumsy swing that caught nothing but air. The momentum carried him into a startled onlooker&#x2019;s arms. That man took exception and shoved back. Within seconds, the room was a blur of fists.<br><br>Standing unnoticed in the shadowed doorway, Rhys shifted his weight. An echo of bloodlust whispered in his ear. As a younger man, he would have hurled himself into the thickest knot of violence, eager to claw and punch his way back out. Just to feel the surge of his racing pulse, the slice of broken glass scoring his flesh, the tang of blood in his mouth. The strange, fleeting sensation of being alive.<br><br>But he wasn&#x2019;t that young man anymore. Thanks to the war, he&#x2019;d had his fill of both fighting and pain. And he&#x2019;d long given up on feeling alive.<br><br>After a minute or two, the peripheral scrabbling defused. Once again the two louts faced off, huffing for breath and clearly hungry for more. They chuckled as they circled one another, as though this were their typical Saturday night fun. It probably was. Wasn&#x2019;t as though life on the moor offered a wealth of amusements other than drinking and brawling.<br><br>Now that he studied their faces, Rhys wondered if the two might be brothers. Or cousins, perhaps. The taller one had mashed features, while the shorter sported a beaky nose. But their eyes reflected the same empty shade of blue, and they wore identical expressions of willful stupidity.<br><br>The shorter one picked up a low stool and taunted his opponent with it, as if baiting a bull. The &#x201c;bull&#x201d; charged. He threw a wild punch over the stool, but his reach fell short by inches. To close the gap, Bull grabbed a brass candlestick from the mantel and whipped it through the air, sucking all sound from the room.<br><br>Whoosh.<br><br>Beak threw aside his stool, and it smashed to splinters against the hearth. With Bull&#x2019;s attention momentarily diverted, Beak dove for a table still set for a meal. Half-empty dishes and bread crusts were strewn over white linen.<br><br>Rhys frowned. When had old Maddox started bothering with tablecloths?<br><br>He stopped wondering about it when Beak came up wielding a knife.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll teach you to raise a club to me, you whoreson,&#x201d; he snarled.<br><br>Everyone in the room froze. Rhys ceased leaning against the doorjamb and stood erect, reconsidering his decision not to intervene. With a brass club and a knife involved, someone was likely to get seriously injured, or worse. As tired as he might be of fighting, he was even more weary of watching men die.<br><br>But before he could act, a series of sounds arrested him where he stood.<br><br>Crash. A bottle breaking.<br><br>Plink, plink, plink. Glass bits trickling to the floor.<br><br>Thud. Beak collapsing to the table unconscious, rivulets of wine streaming down around his ears.<br><br>&#x201c;Harold Symmonds, you&#x2019;ll pay for that wine.&#x201d; A slender, dark-haired woman stood over Beak&#x2019;s senseless form, clutching what remained of a green-glass bottle. &#x201c;And the tablecloth too, you great lout.&#x201d; She shook her head and tsked. &#x201c;Blood and claret will never come out of white linen.<br><br>&#x201c;And as for you, Laurence&#x2014;&#x201d; She wheeled on the second man, threatening him with the broken bottle&#x2019;s sharp glass teeth. Though he was twice as big as the barmaid and a man besides, Laurence held up his hands in surrender.<br><br>In fact, every man in the room had gone still. As though they all feared the harsh discipline this tiny barmaid might dole out. Interesting. To a man like Rhys, who&#x2019;d spent several years commanding soldiers, that snap to attention spoke volumes.<br><br>Jabbing the bottle at Laurence, the barmaid backed him up against the wall. &#x201c; &#x2019;Twas your own master who brought that, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This?&#x201d; He stared at the candlestick in his fist. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Gideon&#x2019;s?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s the inn&#x2019;s.&#x201d; She wrenched the brass club away from the stunned brute and curled her arm, lifting it to eye level. &#x201c;But Gideon delivered it. Hauled it and its mate all the way up from Plymouth just last week. The set came very dear, and I&#x2019;ll thank you to keep your grimy mitts off the bric-a-brac.&#x201d;<br><br>The thing must have weighed a stone, but it cost her no effort to heft the candlestick up on the mantel with one hand and nudge it back into place.<br><br>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; she said to herself, apparently satisfied with the symmetry. Standing back, she threw the jagged remnants of the bottle into the fire, and a wine-fueled blaze surged in the hearth.<br><br>The reddish flare illuminated the woman&#x2019;s face, and Rhys got his first good look at her.<br><br>Holy God. She was beautiful.<br><br>And young.<br><br>And . . . and beautiful.<br><br>Rhys had never been especially good with words. He couldn&#x2019;t have described exactly what it was about this woman that made her appearance so striking. He just knew he&#x2019;d been struck.<br><br>She had pale skin and dark hair coming loose from a thick plait. Her figure was slight, yet feminine. Her eyes were large and wide, but to discern their color he would&#x2019;ve had to stand much closer to her.<br><br>He wanted to stand much closer to her.<br><br>Especially now that she was no longer armed.<br><br>Fury radiated from her slender form as she propped her hands on her hips and scolded the assembly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the same damned scene, again and again.&#x201d; Her tone was sharp, but the voice beneath it was husky, warm. &#x201c;In case you haven&#x2019;t noticed, this inn is all we&#x2019;ve got in Buckleigh-in-the-Moor. I&#x2019;m trying to build a name for this place, make it a respectable establishment for travelers. Now tell me, how am I to make this inn fit for the Quality, what with you overgrown clods destroying my dining room once a fortnight?&#x201d;<br><br>She swept an angry glare around the room, silently confronting each offender in turn. When her gaze collided with Rhys&#x2019;s, he noted the first crack in her veneer of poise. Her eyelashes fluttered. That was the extent of her visible surprise. The rest of her remained granite-still as she said, &#x201c;And all this in front of a guest.&#x201d;<br><br>Rhys sensed every head in the room swiveling to face him. But he couldn&#x2019;t have torn his gaze from the barmaid&#x2019;s if he&#x2019;d tried. Jesus, what a woman.<br><br>Between the travel and the damp, his body had been grousing at him all night. He wouldn&#x2019;t have believed one more part of him could stiffen . . . but evidently it could. His riding breeches pulled snug across his groin. He&#x2019;d gone hard enough to rival that brass candlestick. He hadn&#x2019;t reacted so intensely to a woman since he&#x2019;d been a randy youth. Perhaps not even then. His heart pounded. Blood surged through his veins, carrying orders to his every limb. He felt his whole body tightening, mustering strength, readying for a purpose. A very specific, very pleasurable purpose.<br><br>Damn. He felt alive.<br><br>Still holding his gaze, she said steadily, &#x201c;Now put this place to rights.&#x201d;<br><br>Rhys blinked. He didn&#x2019;t recall this woman&#x2014;he couldn&#x2019;t possibly have forgotten her&#x2014;but had she somehow recognized him? Was she calling him out for his gross negligence as lord? It would be a fair enough accusation. If there was anything that needed putting to rights in Buckleigh-in-the-Moor, the responsibility should be his.<br><br>But as the men before him lurched into motion, scraping chairs and tables against the slate floor as they dragged the furniture back into place, Rhys realized her words hadn&#x2019;t been meant for him. He was almost disappointed. He would have liked to put things to rights for her. Starting with that mussed dark hair.<br><br>With an impatient sweep of her fingers, she tucked a lock behind her ear. &#x201c;Welcome to the Three Hounds,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Are you coming in, or aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>Oh, he was coming in. He was most definitely com- ing in.<br><br>Rhys stepped forward and closed the door behind him.<br><br>Before he could acknowledge her welcome, the barmaid&#x2019;s attention jerked away. &#x201c;Not there, Skinner. Left side of the hearth.&#x201d;<br><br>Skinner hurried to obey. All six burly feet of him.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve a horse outside,&#x201d; Rhys said, once he had her attention again.<br><br>She nodded and summoned a twiggy youth from the bar. &#x201c;Darryl, see to the gentleman&#x2019;s horse.&#x201d; To Rhys she said, &#x201c;Will you drink whiskey, sir?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just ale.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve rabbit stew and mutton pie.&#x201d;<br><br>His stomach rumbled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d welcome both.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have a seat, then.&#x201d;<br><br>Rhys crossed to a table, lowered his weight onto the most sturdy-looking of the chairs, and accepted a tankard of ale from her hand.<br><br>He sipped at the cool ale, watching the barmaid and her band of reformed pugilists clear the room of debris. No wonder this place still did a brisk business. To Rhys&#x2019;s recollection, old Maddox had never kept barmaids this fair, nor this fierce.<br><br>She kept stealing looks at him, even as she swept broken glass from the floor and rolled up the soiled linen tablecloth. There was an intriguing softness to her gaze.<br><br>That couldn&#x2019;t be right. Perhaps she was looking at someone else. Under the guise of stretching, Rhys rotated his neck and turned an unhurried glance about the room.<br><br>No. There was no one else.<br><br>Strange.<br><br>Everything about the woman&#x2014;her bearing, her voice, the reactions she inspired&#x2014;declared her strength. But her eyes were telling him something else. They spoke of hopes and fears and vulnerability, and Rhys had no idea why she&#x2019;d be revealing all that to a complete stranger, least of all him&#x2014;but he knew one thing. Those looks she kept giving him contained more direct human contact than he&#x2019;d known in years.<br><br>She was touching him. From across the room, with her hands otherwise occupied, she was touching him. He felt it deep inside.<br><br>Rhys sipped his ale and pondered the queer nature of fate. He was a steadfast believer in destiny. There was no other way to explain the fact that his heart still beat. In his eleven years in the light infantry, he&#x2019;d spent battle after battle charging headlong into the bloody fray, eager to meet his death. Only to be cruelly disappointed, when fate spared him once again. He simply could not die. But for once, maybe for once his wretched good luck was about to throw him a true boon.<br><br>As she bent to sweep splintered wood from the corner, he observed the gentle curve of her neck, the loose strands of hair at her nape. He could spend a very pleasant minute winding that lock of hair about his finger, counting how many times it would wrap around. ...</p><h2>100 Selected Poems</h2><p>E.E. Cummings is without question one of the major poets of this century, and this volume, first published in 1959, is indispensable for every lover of modern lyrical verse. It contains one hundred of Cummings&#x2019;s wittiest and most profound poems, harvested from thirty-five of the most radically creative years in contemporary American poetry. These poems exhibit all the extraordinary lyricism, playfulness, technical ingenuity, and compassion for which Cummings is famous. They demonstrate beautifully his extrapolations from traditional poetic structures and his departures from them, as well as the unique synthesis of lavish imagery and acute artistic precision that has won him the adulation and respect of critics and poetry lovers everywhere.</p><p>E.E. Cummings is a concentrate of titanic significance.&#x201d; Marianne Moore<br><br> To my way of thinking Cummings is, within his field of personal emotion, the lyrical field, one of the inventors of our time. He puts his inventions down with an unexpected refurbishing of phrase and a filigree delicacy of hairbreadth exact statement that is a continual challenge.&#x201d; John Dos Passos<br><br> No one else has ever made avant-garde, experimental poems so attractive both to the general and the special reader; since the early twenties, Cummings has been more widely imitated and easily appreciated than any other modernist poet.&#x201d; Randall Jarrell<br><br> He has more control over language than any poet since Joyce. . . . Everybody delights in reading him.&#x201d; Karl Shapiro<br><br> E.E. Cummings is a concentrate of titanic significance, a positive character&#x2019;; and only ingenuousness could attempt to suggest in a word the heroic&#x2019; aspect of his painting, his poems, and his resistances. He does not make aesthetic mistakes.&#x201d; Marianne Moore<br></p><h2>When Sue Found Sue: Sue Hendrickson Discovers Her T. Rex</h2><p>From a very young age, Sue Hendrickson was meant to find things: lost coins, perfume bottles, even hidden treasure. Her endless curiosity eventually led to her career in diving and paleontology, where she would continue to find things big and small. In 1990, at a dig in South Dakota, Sue made her biggest discovery to date: Sue the T. rex, the largest and most complete T. rex skeleton ever unearthed. Named in Sue&#x2019;s honor, Sue the T. rex would be placed on permanent exhibition at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.&nbsp;<i>When Sue Found Sue&nbsp;</i>inspires readers to take a closer look at the world around them and to never lose their brave, adventurous spirits.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Toni Buzzeo&nbsp;</b>is the author of the Caldecott Honor Book and&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestseller&nbsp;<i>One Cool&nbsp;</i><i>Friend&nbsp;</i>and many other books for children. She lives in Arlington, Massachusetts.&nbsp;<b>Diana Sudyka&nbsp;</b>is a Chicago-based illustrator who got her start designing and screen-printing posters for musicians such as St. Vincent, Andrew Bird, and the Decemberists. She also volunteers at the Field Museum in Chicago, where Sue the T. rex is housed.&nbsp;Gr 1-4-Sue Hendrickson was a shy but smart and curious little girl who was constantly on the hunt for things. Whether searching for lost trinkets, butterfly wings, shells, or information from books she read, Hendrickson possessed a voracious appetite for knowledge. As she got older, her natural curiosity grew. She joined teams of explorers to find different creatures and artifacts from around the world. Soon, she found herself looking for the things she'd most want to find, namely fossilized dinosaurs. After four years of digging in South Dakota, Hendrickson discovered a nearly complete skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus rex. The skeleton, named in her honor, was one of the best-preserved fossils ever discovered and remains on display at the Field Museum in Chicago. This delightfully illustrated tale of discovery and wonderment works great as a research starter or supplement to paleontology, basic science, or museum studies, and includes further references. The images combine a sense of simplicity and detail with large, full-page illustrations, and smaller eye-catching pops of color to keep readers exploring. VERDICT Appropriate for readers and listeners of all ages, this book rewards passions for learning and passes those values on to its readers. A must-have title for explorers and dino lovers alike.-Thomas Jonte, Pensacola State College, FL&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011. Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.

An unwanted fourth daughter, Four-Girl isn't even given a proper name by her family. She finds friendship-and a name, Vibiana-in the most unlikely of places: Christianity. But China is a dangerous place for Christians. The Boxer Rebellion is murdering Westerners and Chinese Christians alike. Torn between her nation and her Christian friends, Vibiana will have to decide where her true loyalties lie . . . and whether she is willing to die for her faith. <br><i>----</i><br><i>Boxers &amp; Saints</i> is a groundbreaking graphic novel in two volumes. This innovative format presents two parallel tales about young people caught up on opposite sides of a violent rift. <i>Saints </i>tells Vibiana's story, and the companion volume, <i>Boxers</i>, tells the story of Little Bao, a young man who joins the Boxer Rebellion. <i>American Born Chinese</i> author Gene Luen Yang brings his trademark magical realism to the complexities of the Boxer Rebellion, and lays bare the universal foundations of extremism, rebellion, and faith.</p></p><p><b>Gene Luen Yang</b> began drawing comic books in the fifth grade. He was an established figure in the indie comics scene when he published his first book with First Second, <i>American Born Chinese, </i>which is now in print in over ten languages. <i>American Born Chinese'</i>s critical and commercial success, along with its status as a National Book Award finalist and winner of the Printz Award, catapulted Yang into stardom as a major voice of our times. <i>Boxers &amp; Saints</i> is his most recent graphic novel.Gr 9 Up-Acclaimed graphic novelist Yang brings his talents to historical fiction in these paired novels set during China's Boxer Rebellion (1899-1900). In Boxers, life in Little Bao's peaceful rural village is disrupted when "foreign devils"-a priest and his phalanx of soldiers-arrive. The foreigners behave with astonishing arrogance, smashing the village god, appropriating property, and administering vicious beatings for no reason. Little Bao and his older brothers train in kung fu and swordplay in order to defend against them, and when Little Bao learns how to tap into the power of the Chinese gods, he becomes the leader of a peasant army, eventually marching to Beijing. Saints follows a lonely girl from a neighboring village. Unwanted by her family, Four-Girl isn't even given a proper name until she converts to Catholicism and is baptized-by the very same priest who bullies Little Bao's village. Four-Girl, now known as Vibiana, leaves home and finds fulfillment in service to the Church, while Little Bao roams the countryside committing acts of increasing violence as his army grows. Mysticism plays a part in both stories, and Yang's spare, clean drawing style makes it clear that Vibiana's visits from Joan of Arc and Bao's invocation of the powerful Chinese gods are very real to these characters. The juxtaposition of these opposing points of view, both of them sympathetic, makes for powerful, thought-provoking storytelling about a historical period that is not well known in the West.-Paula Willey, Baltimore County Public Library, Towson, MD&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Jane Roberts&#x2019; beloved character, Oversoul Seven, an ageless student of the universe, explores the entire framework of our existence. . . . As we follow Seven&#x2019;s education, our own beliefs about life, death, dreams, time and space are challenged and stretched, leaving us with a refreshing and provocative perspective on the true nature of reality. In The Education of Oversoul Seven, Seven explores the true nature of his being as he learns to communicate with four of his "incarnations" &#x2014; four all-too-human people whose lives are separated by centuries, yet who also coexist. In The Further Education of Oversoul Seven, the adventure continues with Seven facing new lessons as his human incarnations struggle with the problems of sanity, free will, and even godhood. In the third saga of this exuberant adventure, Oversoul Seven and the Museum of Time, Seven is instructed to take up residence in a human body while also journeying to the Museum of Time in search of the "Codicils." The Codicils are eternal truths that bring about the greatest opportunities for vitality, understanding, and fulfillment. The adventures of Oversoul Seven, are at once an intriguing fantasy, a mind-altering exploration of our inner being, and a vibrant celebration of life</p><p>Jane Roberts (May 8, 1929 &#x2013; September 5, 1984) grew up in Saratoga Springs, New York where she attended Skidmore College.

Butts.</p><h2>Evangelical Is Not Enough: Worship of God in Liturgy and Sacrament</h2><p>In this deeply moving narrative, Thomas Howard describes his pilgrimage from Evangelicalism (which he loves and reveres as the religion of his youth) to liturgical Christianity. He soon afterward became a Roman Catholic. He describes Evangelicalism with great sympathy and then examines more formal, liturgical worship with the freshness of someone discovering for the first time what his soul had always hungered for. This is a book of apologetics without polemics. Non-Catholics will gain an appreciation of the formal and liturgical side of Catholicism. Catholics will see with fresh eyes the beauty of their tradition. Worship, prayer, the Blessed Virgin, the Mass, and the liturgical year are taken one after the other, and what may have seemed routine and repetitive suddenly comes to life under the enchanting wand of Howard&#39;s beautiful prose. Howard unfolds for us just what occurs in the vision and imagination of a Christian who, nurtured in the earnestness of Protestant Evangelicalism, finds himself yearning for &#34;whatever-it-is&#34; that has been there in the Church for 2000 years. It traces Howard&#39;s soul-searching and shows why he believes the practices of the liturgical Church are an invaluable aid for any Christian&#39;s spiritual life. Reminiscent of the style and scope of Newman, Lewis and Knox, this book is destined to be a classic.</p><p>Thomas Howard was a Professor of English and Literature for over 30 years. He is the author of numerous popular books including Chance or the Dance, Dove Descending: T.S. Eliot&#39;s Four Quartets, On Being Catholic, Lead Kindly Light and Evangelical is Not Enough.</p><h2>The Bhagavad Gita (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>The <em>Bhagavad Gita</em> is the most widely read Hindu religious text in the Western world and a key work for understanding Indian religions and the way Hinduism has been represented in modern India and the West. The poem considers social and religious duty, the nature of sacrifice, and the relationship of human beings to God, and continues to inspire a wide variety of interpretations, both within India and beyond.<br><br>This new translation captures all the force and beauty of the original language of this awe-inspiring poem. Ideal for readers encountering the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em> for the first time, this edition provides a full cultural and historical context in its introduction and notes.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Tragedy &amp; Hope: A History of the World in Our Time by Carroll Quigley is the ultimate insider admission of a secret global elite that has impacted nearly every modern historical event. Learn how the Anglo-American banking elite were able to secretly establish and maintain their global power. This massive book provides a detailed world history beginning with the industrial revolution and imperialism through two world wars, a global depression and the rise of communism. Tragedy &amp; Hope is the definitive work on the world's power structure and an essential source material for understanding the history, goals and actions of the New World Order. ALL ORIGINAL CONTENT,&nbsp;UNABRIDGED.</p><p>ORIGINAL BOOK DESCRIPTION: TRAGEDY AND HOPE shows the years 1895-1950 as a period of transition from the world dominated by Europe in the nineteenth century to the world of three blocs in the twentieth century. With clarity, perspective, and cumulative impact, Professor Quigley examines the nature of that transition through two world wars and a worldwide economic depression. As an interpretative historian, he tries to show each event in the full complexity of its historical context. The result is a unique work, notable in several ways. It gives a picture of the world in terms of the influence of different cultures and outlooks upon each other; it shows, more completely than in any similar work, the influence of science and technology on human life; and it explains, with unprecedented clarity, how the intricate financial and commercial patterns of the West prior to 1914 influenced the development of today's world.</p></p><p></p><h2>Curiosity Thrilled the Cat (Magical Cats)</h2><p><b>Meet small town librarian Kathleen Paulson and her fantastical felines, Hercules and Owen, in the first novel in the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Magical Cats Mystery series.</b><br><br>When librarian Kathleen Paulson moved to Mayville Heights, Minnesota, she had no idea that two strays would nuzzle their way into her life.

But over many years, as more and more land was cleared, Kenya was transformed.

To the contrary, Stark argues that the Crusades were the first military response to unwarranted Muslim terrorist aggression. </p><p>Stark reviews the history of the seven major Crusades from 1095 to 1291, demonstrating that the Crusades were precipitated by Islamic provocations, centuries of bloody attempts to colonize the West, and sudden attacks on Christian pilgrims and holy places. Although the Crusades were initiated by a plea from the pope, Stark argues that this had nothing to do with any elaborate design of the Christian world to convert all Muslims to Christianity by force of arms. Given current tensions in the Middle East and terrorist attacks around the world, Stark's views are a thought-provoking contribution to our understanding and are sure to spark debate.</p><p>Rodney Stark is the Distinguished Professor of the Social Sciences at Baylor University. His thirty books on the history and sociology of religion include <em>The Rise of Christianity</em>, <em>Cities of God</em>, <em>For the Glory of God</em>, <em>Discovering God</em>, and <em>The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success</em>. Stark received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley.</p></p><h2>Three Nights with a Scoundrel (Stud Club Trilogy)</h2><p>In Tessa Dare&#x2019;s dazzling new trilogy, the men of the Stud Club live and play by their own rules&#x2014;until passion changes the game.<br>&nbsp;<br>The bastard son of a nobleman, Julian Bellamy is now polished to perfection, enthralling the ton with wit and charm while clandestinely plotting to ruin the lords, ravish the ladies, and have the last laugh on a society that once spurned him. But after meeting Leo Chatwick, a decent man and founder of an elite gentlemen&#x2019;s club, and Lily, Leo&#x2019;s enchanting sister, Julian reconsiders his wild ways. And when Leo&#x2019;s tragic murder demands that Julian hunt for justice, he vows to see the woman he secretly loves married to a man of her own class. <br><br>Lily, however, has a very different husband in mind.&nbsp; She&#x2019;s loved Julian forever, adores the man beneath the rakish fa�ade, and wants to savor the delicious attraction they share&#x2014;as his wife. His insistence on marrying her off only reinforces her intent to prove that he is the only man for her. Obsessed with catching a killer, Julian sinks back to the gutters of his youth, forcing Lily to reach out with a sweet, reckless passion Julian can&#x2019;t resist. Can her desire for a scoundrel save them both&#x2014;or will dangerous secrets threaten more than their tender love?</p><p>Tessa Dare a part-time librarian, full-time mommy, and swing-shift writer. She makes her home in Southern California, where she shares a cozy, cluttered bungalow with her husband, their two children, and a dog.Chapter One<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> London, October 1817<br> &nbsp;<br> Lily awoke to a rough shake on her arm. A searing ball of light hovered before her face.<br> &nbsp;<br> She winced, and the light quickly receded. With caution, she opened her eyes. Blinking furiously, Lily strained to make out the lamp-bearer&#x2019;s identity. It was Holling, the housekeeper.<br> &nbsp;<br> Good Lord. She bolted upright in bed. Something dreadful had occurred. The servants would never shake her awake unless it was a matter of extreme urgency.<br> &nbsp;<br> She pressed a hand to her throat. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Yellow lamplight illuminated an apologetic face. &#x201c;Downstairs, my lady. You&#x2019;re needed downstairs at once. Begging your pardon.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> With a nod of assent, Lily rose from bed. She shoved her toes into night-chilled slippers and accepted assistance in donning a violet silk wrap.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her sense of dread only mounted as she descended the stairs. And the feeling was all too familiar.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nearly five months had passed since the last time she&#x2019;d been summoned downstairs in the dark. No one had needed to wake her then; she&#x2019;d been unable to sleep for an insistent sense of foreboding. Her fears were confirmed when she opened the door to find gentlemen crowding her doorstep&#x2014;three men with nothing in common save their membership in the Stud Club, an exclusive horse-breeding society her brother Leo had founded. They were the reclusive Duke of Morland, scarred war hero Rhys St. Maur, and Julian Bellamy&#x2014;the London ton&#x2019;s favorite hell-raiser and Leo&#x2019;s closest friend.<br> &nbsp;<br> One look at their grave faces that night, and there&#x2019;d been no need for words. Lily had known instantly what they&#x2019;d come to tell her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Leo was dead.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the age of eight-and-twenty, her twin brother was dead. Leo Chatwick, the Marquess of Harcliffe. Young, handsome, wealthy, universally admired&#x2014;beaten to death in a Whitechapel alleyway, the victim of footpads.<br> &nbsp;<br> The last time she&#x2019;d been summoned down these stairs at night, her existence had been torn in half.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lily&#x2019;s knees buckled as she reached the foot of the staircase. She clutched the banister for support, then drew a shaky breath as a footman waved her toward the door.<br> &nbsp;<br> Holling thrust her lamp over the threshold. Gathering all her available bravery, Lily moved toward the door and peeked out.<br> &nbsp;<br> As there was no one on the doorstep, her view went straight to the square. The first gray insinuation of daylight hovered over the manicured hedges and paths. The streets were still largely empty, but here and there she saw servants on their way to market.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the housekeeper&#x2019;s insistent gesturing, she looked down. There, on the pavement at the bottom of the steps, lodged a costermonger&#x2019;s wheelbarrow. The wooden cart was heaped with carrots, turnips, vegetable marrows&nbsp;...&nbsp;and the body of an unconscious man.<br> &nbsp;<br> She clutched the doorjamb. Oh, no.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was Julian Bellamy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lily recognized the red cuff of his coat before she even saw his face. She clapped a palm to her mouth, smothering a cry of alarm.<br> &nbsp;<br> There&#x2019;d been one consolation in mourning Leo: the knowledge that she could never endure such a devastating loss again. He was her twin, her best friend from birth and, since their parents&#x2019; deaths, her only remaining close kin. She would never love anyone so dearly as she&#x2019;d loved him. Once Leo had left this world&nbsp;...&nbsp;pain could not touch her now.<br> &nbsp;<br> Or so she&#x2019;d thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> Staring down at Julian&#x2019;s senseless form, it was hard to believe she&#x2019;d ever felt this frantic. She sensed her throat emitting sounds&#x2014;ugly, croaking sounds, she feared. But she couldn&#x2019;t make herself stop. Even when Leo had died, Julian had been there to stand by her. Devilish rake he might be, he was her brother&#x2019;s steadfast friend, and hers as well. Over the years, they&#x2019;d come to think of him as family. If Julian left her&nbsp;...<br> &nbsp;<br> She would truly be alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> For the second time that morning, Holling gave her arm a shake. Lily looked to the housekeeper.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s alive,&#x201d; the older woman said. &#x201c;Still breathing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Tears of relief rushed past Lily&#x2019;s defenses. &#x201c;Bring him in.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The footmen scrambled to obey, lifting his sprawled body from the wheelbarrow and hefting it up the steps.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;To the kitchen.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They all filed down the narrow corridor, heading for the rear of the house. Holling first with her lamp, then the footmen bearing Julian. Lily brought up the rear as they descended the short flight of steps to the kitchen.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even at this early hour, the kitchen staff was hard at work. A toasty fire warmed the room, and a yeasty aroma filled the air. A scullery maid lifted floury hands from the breadboard and stepped back in alarm, making room for the footmen to pass.<br> &nbsp;<br> They placed Julian by the hearth, propping his head on a sack of meal.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Send for the doctor,&#x201d; she said. When no one sprang into action, she repeated herself at the top of her lungs. &#x201c;Doctor. Now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> With a hasty bow, one of the footmen hurried from the room.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lily knelt at Julian&#x2019;s side. Heavens, he was filthy. Dirt streaked his face, and the smell of the gutter clung to his clothes. She put a hand to his forehead, finding it clammy and cool to the touch. Perhaps he needed air. Her fingers flew to his cravat, and she tugged at it, unwinding the starched linen from his throat. A day&#x2019;s growth of whiskers scraped her fingertips. She turned her cheek to his face, rejoicing at the warm puff of breath against her skin.<br> &nbsp;<br> He suddenly convulsed, as if coughing.<br> &nbsp;<br> She ceased her tussle with his cravat and pulled back to stare at him, not wanting to miss any word he might speak.<br> &nbsp;<br> His eyes went in and out of focus as his gaze meandered over her form. &#x201c;Hullo, Lily.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Relief washed through her. &#x201c;Julian. Are you well?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He blinked several times, in rapid succession. Then again, slowly. Finally he said, &#x201c;Violet always was your color.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He slumped back, eyes closed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Was he drunk? She leaned forward, sniffing cautiously at his exposed throat. No liquor. No gutter smells here, either. Just hints of starch and soap, mingled with the metallic, pungent odor of&nbsp;...<br> &nbsp;<br> Oh, God.<br> &nbsp;<br> She grabbed his arm, shook it hard. &#x201c;Julian. Julian, wake up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> When he failed to respond, she withdrew her trembling hand and looked down at it. <br> &nbsp;<br> Just as she&#x2019;d feared. Her fingers came away wet with blood.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Incorrigible Children of Ashton Place: Book V: The Unmapped Sea (Incorrigible Children of Ashton Place, 5)</h2><p><p>For fans of Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events and Trenton Lee Stewart's Mysterious Benedict Society, here comes the fifth book in the Incorrigible Children of Ashton Place, the acclaimed and hilarious Victorian mystery series by Maryrose Wood.</p><p>Lord Fredrick Ashton may not feel ready to be a father, but with a little Ashton on the way, he's sure about one thing: the wolfish curse on his family must end soon, before the child is born.

Lord Fredrick Ashton may not feel ready to be a father, but with a little Ashton on the way, he's sure about one thing: The wolfish curse on his family must end soon, before the child is born. Otherwise, he warns Miss Penelope Lumley, "a barking baby Ashton is just what we shall have."</p><p>Penelope takes on the challenge, for she knows that the fate of her own pupils is strangely bound to the fate of the moon-cursed Ashtons. The missing puzzle piece lies within the fading memory of an ancient mariner named Pudge, a resident of the old sailors' home in Brighton. When Lady Constance's doctor prescribes a seaside holiday, Penelope jumps at the chance to take the three Incorrigible children to Brighton. There, with the help of her friend Simon, she hopes to find out what Pudge knows.</p><p>The Ashtons are not the only ones at the beach in January, however.

This process of fabrication is fully permitted under the terms of the author's Poetic License, which is one of her most prized possessions.</p><p>Maryrose's other qualifications for writing these tales include a scandalous stint as a professional thespian, many years as a private governess to two curious and occasionally rambunctious pupils, and whatever literary insights she may have gleaned from living in close proximity to a clever but disobedient dog.</p></p><h2>Healing Pluto Problems</h2><p>Well-written and moving account of Pluto in the natal chart, and how Pluto aspects can affect childhood, adulthood, and life in general.

And then trace it as the road curves toward little Capernaum. Follow the story of Appius, a proud centurion, and Tullus, his scribe and slave. From a battle with the Parthians, through a tragic personal crisis, to the gladiator arena at Caesarea Maritima, their tale finally leads to the backwater village of Capernaum on the shores of Galilee. There, in a culture not their own and during a week they will never forget, they encounter a Jewish prophet from Nazareth. <em>A Week in the Life of a Roman Centurion</em> gives us a first-century view of the world of the Gospels.

(The Light Canada, May 2015)<br><br>"<em>A Week in the Life of a Roman Centurion</em> is a helpful introduction to first-century history cloaked in an arresting story of a Roman centurion and his young slave, Tullus. Burge's careful reconstructive work frames and fills in the story, with each chapter concluding with more detailed information about the various topics raised in that chapter (e.g., Capernaum, honor and shame, the Roman army). Yet for all its pedagogical value, the reader will be riveted by the story itself&#x2015;an imaginative retelling of the backstory of a centurion who comes to Jesus for healing for his slave. Gary Burge proves to be a masterful storyteller in this engaging and fast-paced narrative. A great book for anyone interested in the New Testament and its social world." (Jeannine K. Brown, professor of New Testament, Bethel Seminary, San Diego)<br><br>"I couldn't put this book down. Part historical novel and part cultural handbook, Gary Burge's <em>A Week in the Life of a Roman Centurion</em> is a delight to read. This will be a great supplemental text for my New Testament courses. Students will be so entertained they won't even realize how much they're learning!" (Mark L. Strauss, professor of New Testament, Bethel Seminary, San Diego)<br><br>"Masterfully written and extensively researched, this fast-paced account invites the reader into the first-century world of the Gospels even while intriguing the reader as a good story should. In contrast to some scholars' wooden portrayals of all Jews or Romans or Syrians as the same, in this story, the characters are nuanced and come alive." (Craig Keener, F. M. and Ada Thompson Professor of Biblical Studies, Asbury Theological Seminary, author, The IVP Bible Background Commentary: New Testament)<br><br>"Biblical scholars are not typically known for writing historical novels, much less gripping page-turners. Gary Burge, however, has accomplished both of these feats. Fully true to the historical-cultural setting of the early first-century Roman Empire, this story not only makes the New Testament world come alive but it creates one very plausible scenario of the career and family of the Capernaum centurion of Matthew 8:5-13 and Luke 7:1-10. The characters become so real that I was even tearing up at the end of Burge's story!" (Craig L. Blomberg, Distinguished Professor of New Testament, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Burge&#x2019;s book is the embodiment of educational subterfuge, cloaked in the tunic of a Roman centurion."

In the Tibetan tantric view the elements are recognized as five kinds of energy in the body and are balanced with a program of yogic movements, breathing exercises, and visualizations. In these Dzogchen teachings the elements are understood to be the radiance of being and are accessed through pure awareness. <i>Healing with Form, Energy, and Light</i> offers the reader healing meditations and yogic practices on each of these levels. Tenzin Rinpoche's purpose is to strengthen our connection to the sacred aspect of the natural world and to present a guide that explains why certain practices are necessary and in what situations practices are effective or a hindrance. This is a manual for replacing an anxious, narrow, uncomfortable identity with one that is expansive, peaceful, and capable. And the world too is transformed from dead matter and blind processes into a sacred landscape filled with an infinite variety of living forces and beings.</p><p>Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche, a lama in the B�n tradition of Tibet, presently resides in Charlottesville, Virginia. He is the founder and director of Ligmincha Institute, an organization dedicated to the study and practice of the teachings of the B�n tradition.

Buckley made a confession to Corey Robin. Capitalism is "boring," said the founding father of the American right. "Devoting your life to it," as conservatives do, "is horrifying if only because it's so repetitious. It's like sex." With this unlikely conversation began Robin's decade-long foray into the conservative mind. What is conservatism, and what's truly at stake for its proponents? If capitalism bores them, what excites them?<br><br>In <em>The Reactionary Mind</em>, Robin traces conservatism back to its roots in the reaction against the French Revolution. He argues that the right was inspired, and is still united, by its hostility to emancipating the lower orders. Some conservatives endorse the free market; others oppose it. Some criticize the state; others celebrate it. Underlying these differences is the impulse to defend power and privilege against movements demanding freedom and equality -- while simultaneously making populist appeals to the masses. Despite their opposition to these movements, conservatives favor a dynamic conception of politics and society -- one that involves self-transformation, violence, and war. They are also highly adaptive to new challenges and circumstances. This partiality to violence and capacity for reinvention have been critical to their success.<br><br>Written by a highly-regarded, keen observer of the contemporary political scene, <em>The Reactionary Mind</em> ranges widely, from Edmund Burke to Antonin Scalia and Donald Trump, and from John C. Calhoun to Ayn Rand. It advances the notion that all right-wing ideologies, from the eighteenth century through today, are improvisations on a theme: the felt experience of having power, seeing it threatened, and trying to win it back. When its first edition appeared in 2011, The Reactionary Mind set off a fierce debate. It has since been acclaimed as "the book that predicted Trump" (<em>New Yorker</em>) and "one of the more influential political works of the last decade" (<em>Washington Monthly</em>). Now updated to include Trump's election and his first one hundred days in office, <em>The Reactionary Mind</em> is more relevant than ever.<br></p><p><br><strong>Corey Robin </strong>teaches political science at Brooklyn College and the CUNY Graduate Center. His writings have appeared in the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Harper's</em>, and the <em>London Review of Books</em>.<br><br>"<em>The Reactionary Mind</em> has emerged as one of the more influential political works of the last decade." <br>--<em>Washington Monthly</em> <br><p></p><br>"Robin is an engaging writer, and just the kind of broad-ranging public intellectual all too often missing in academic political science. Robin's arguments deserve widespread attention." <br>--<em>The New Republic</em> <br><p></p><br>"A very readable romp through the evils of Conservatism." <br>--<em>The Observer</em><p></p><br>"The common opinion on the Left is that conservatives are fire-breathing idiots, who make up in heat what they lack in light. Robin's book is a welcome correction of this simplistic view and puts the debate where it ought to be: on the force and content of conservative ideas." <br>--<em>Dissent</em> <br><p></p><br>"This little book will continue to spark controversy, but that is not the reason to read it: it is a witty, erudite and opinionated account of one of the most significant movements of our times." <br>--<em>Times Higher Education</em> <br><p></p><br>"...written with panache. The series of scholarly strikes Robin makes against conventional wisdom are often exhilarating." <br>--<em>The Daily</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>The Reactionary Mind</em> is a wonderfully good read. It combines up-to-the-minute relevance with an eye to the intellectual history of conservatism in all its protean forms, going back as far as Hobbes, and taking in not only restrained and sentimental defenders of tradition such as Burke, but his more violent, proto-fascist contemporary Joseph de Maistre. Some readers will enjoy Corey Robin's dismantling of different recent thinkers--Barry Goldwater, Antonin Scalia, Irving Kristol; others will enjoy his demolition of Ayn Rand's intellectual pretensions. Some will be uncomfortable when they discover that those who too lightly endorse state violence, and even officially sanctioned torture, include some of their friends. That is one of the things that makes this such a good book." <br>--Alan Ryan, Professor of Political Theory, Oxford University <br><p></p><br>"A fascinating exploration of a central idea: that conservatism is, at its heart, a reaction against democratic challenges, in public and private life, to hierarchies of power and status. Corey Robin leads us through a series of case studies over the last few centuries--from Hobbes to Ayn Rand, from Burke to Sarah Palin--showing the power of this idea by illuminating conservatives both sublime and ridiculous." <br>--Kwame Anthony Appiah, Professor of Philosophy, Princeton University <br><p></p><br>"It is a thoughtful, even-tempered sort of book. The old maid tendency that dominates liberal polemic in the U.S.--the shrieking, clutching at skirts, and jumping up on kitchen chairs that one gets from a Joe Nocera, a Maureen Dowd, or a Keith Olbermann--is quite absent.

Tintin joins the professor on his trip to this foreign land, but can the Professor be trusted?</p><p>Political unrest in Europe in the late 1930s influenced Herge when he wrote <i>King Ottokar's Sceptre</i>, in which Tintin and absent-minded Professor Alembick travel to Syldavia to try to avert a confrontation with neighboring Borduria. The history Herge creates for his fictional Eastern European country is complex and fascinating, and a locked-room mystery and cross-country pursuit make for one of Tintin's more entertaining adventures. Syldavia and Borduria would return in later stories, as would one of Herge's most memorable characters, Bianca Castafiore, the "Milanese Nightingale" renowned for her rendition of the "Jewel Song" from <i>Faust</i>. <i>--David Horiuchi</i>Herg�, one of the most famous Belgians in the world, was a comics writer and artist. The internationally successful Adventures of Tintin are his most well-known and beloved works.

When he came up against a wall&#x2014;the wall of jargon that mystifies science and withholds its treasures from the rest of us, for example, or the wall around our souls that keeps us from taking the revelations of science to heart&#x2014;when he came up against one of those topless old walls, he would, like some latter-day Joshua, use all of his many strengths to bring it down.</p><p>As a child in Brooklyn, he had recited the Hebrew V&#x2019;Ahavta prayer from Deuteronomy at temple services: &#x201c;And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your might.&#x201d; He knew it by heart, and it may have been the inspiration for him to first ask, What is love without understanding? And what greater might do we possess as human beings than our capacity to question and to learn?</p><p>The more Carl learned about nature, about the vastness of the universe and the awesome timescales of cosmic evolution, the more he was uplifted.</p><p>Another way in which he was Old Testament: He couldn&#x2019;t live a compartmentalized life, operating on one set of assumptions in the laboratory and keeping another, conflicting set for the Sabbath. He took the idea of God so seriously that it had to pass the most rigorous standards of scrutiny.</p><p>How was it, he wondered, that the eternal and omniscient Creator described in the Bible could confidently assert so many fundamental misconceptions about Creation? Why would the God of the Scriptures be far less knowledgeable about nature than are we, newcomers, who have only just begun to study the universe? He could not bring himself to overlook the Bible&#x2019;s formulation of a flat, six-thousand-year-old earth, and he found especially tragic the notion that we had been created separately from all other living things. The discovery of our relatedness to all life was borne out by countless distinct and compelling lines of evidence. For Carl, Darwin&#x2019;s insight that life evolved over the eons through natural selection was not just better science than Genesis, it also afforded a deeper, more satisfying spiritual experience.</p><p>He believed that the little we do know about nature suggests that we know even less about God. We had only just managed to get an inkling of the grandeur of the cosmos and its exquisite laws that guide the evolution of trillions if not infinite numbers of worlds. This newly acquired vision made the God who created the World seem hopelessly local and dated, bound to transparently human misperceptions and conceits of the past.</p><p>This was no glib assertion on his part. He avidly studied the world&#x2019;s religions, both living and defunct, with the same hunger for learning that he brought to scientific subjects. He was enchanted by their poetry and history. When he debated religious leaders, he frequently surprised them with his ability to out-quote the sacred texts. Some of these debates led to longstanding friendships and alliances for the protection of life. However, he never understood why anyone would want to separate science, which is just a way of searching for what is true, from what we hold sacred, which are those truths that inspire love and awe.</p><p>His argument was not with God but with those who believed that our understanding of the sacred had been completed. Science&#x2019;s permanently revolutionary conviction that the search for truth never ends seemed to him the only approach with sufficient humility to be worthy of the universe that it revealed. The methodology of science, with its error-correcting mechanism for keeping us honest in spite of our chronic tendencies to project, to misunderstand, to deceive ourselves and others, seemed to him the height of spiritual discipline. If you are searching for sacred knowledge and not just a palliative for your fears, then you will train yourself to be a good skeptic.</p><p>The idea that the scientific method should be applied to the deepest of questions is frequently decried as &#x201c;scientism.&#x201d; This charge is made by those who hold that religious beliefs should be off-limits to scientific scrutiny&#x2014;that beliefs (convictions without evidence that can be tested) are a sufficient way of knowing. Carl understood this feeling, but he insisted with Bertrand Russell that &#x201c;what is wanted is not the will to believe, but the desire to find out, which is the exact opposite.&#x201d; And in all things, even when it came to facing his own cruel fate&#x2014;he succumbed to pneumonia on December 20, 1996, after enduring three bone-marrow transplants&#x2014;Carl didn&#x2019;t want just to believe: He wanted to know.</p><p>Until about five hundred years ago, there had been no such wall separating science and religion. Back then they were one and the same. It was only when a group of religious men who wished &#x201c;to read God&#x2019;s mind&#x201d; realized that science would be the most powerful means to do so that a wall was needed. These men&#x2014;among them Galileo, Kepler, Newton, and, much later, Darwin&#x2014;began to articulate and internalize the scientific method. Science took off for the stars, and institutional religion, choosing to deny the new revelations, could do little more than build a protective wall around itself.</p><p>Science has carried us to the gateway to the universe. And yet our conception of our surroundings remains the disproportionate view of the still-small child. We are spiritually and culturally paralyzed, unable to face the vastness, to embrace our lack of centrality and find our actual place in the fabric of nature. We batter this planet as if we had someplace else to go. That we even do science is a hopeful glimmer of mental health. However, it&#x2019;s not enough merely to accept these insights intellectually while we cling to a spiritual ideology that is not only rootless in nature but also, in many ways, contemptuous of what is natural. Carl believed that our best hope of preserving the exquisite fabric of life on our world would be to take the revelations of science to heart.</p><p>And that he did. &#x201c;Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious,&#x201d; he wrote in his book Cosmos. &#x201c;If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies you will not find another.&#x201d; He lobbied NASA for years to instruct Voyager 2 to look back to Earth and take a picture of it from out by Neptune. Then he asked us to meditate on that image and see our home for what it is&#x2014;just a tiny &#x201c;pale blue dot&#x201d; afloat in the immensity of the universe. He dreamed that we might attain a spiritual understanding of our true circumstances. Like a prophet of old, he wanted to arouse us from our stupor so that we would take action to protect our home.</p><p>Carl wanted us to see ourselves not as the failed clay of a disappointed Creator but as starstuff, made of atoms forged in the fiery hearts of distant stars. To him we were &#x201c;starstuff pondering the stars; organized assemblages of 10 billion billion billion atoms considering the evolution of atoms; tracing the long journey by which, here at least, consciousness arose.&#x201d; For him science was, in part, a kind of &#x201c;informed worship.&#x201d; No single step in the pursuit of enlightenment should ever be considered sacred; only the search was.</p><p>This imperative was one of the reasons he was willing to get into so much trouble with his colleagues for tearing down the walls that have excluded most of us from the insights and values of science. Another was his fear that we would be unable to keep even the limited degree of democracy we have achieved. Our society is based on science and high technology, but only a small minority among us has even a superficial understanding of how they work. How can we hope to be responsible citizens of a democratic society, informed decision makers regarding the inevitable challenges posed by these newly acquired powers?</p><p>This vision of a critically thoughtful public, awakened to science as a way of thinking, impelled him to speak at many places where scientists were not usually found: kindergartens, naturalization ceremonies, an all-black college in the segregated South of 1962, at demonstrations of nonviolent civil disobedience, on the Tonight show. And he did this while maintaining a pioneering, astonishingly productive, fearlessly interdisciplinary scientific career.</p><p>He was especially thrilled to be invited to give the Gifford Lectures on Natural Theology of 1985 at the University of Glasgow. He would be following in the footsteps of some of the greatest scientists and philosophers of the last hundred years&#x2014;including James Frazer, Arthur Eddington, Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, Alfred North Whitehead, Albert Schweitzer, and Hannah Arendt.</p><p>Carl saw these lectures as a chance to set down in detail his understanding of the relationship between religion and science and something of his own search to understand the nature of the sacred. In the course of them, he touches on several themes that he had written about elsewhere; however, what follows is the definitive statement of what he took pains to stress were only his personal views on this endlessly fascinating subject.</p><p>At the beginning of each Gifford Lecture, a distinguished member of the university community would introduce Carl and marvel at the need for still more additional halls to accommodate the overflow audience. I have been careful not to change the meaning of anything Carl said, but I have taken the liberty of editing out those gracious introductory remarks as well as the hundred or more notations on the audio transcripts that merely say &#x201c;[Laughter].&#x201d;</p><p>I ask the reader to keep in mind at all times that any deficiencies of this book are my responsibility and not Carl&#x2019;s. Despite the fact that the unedited transcripts reveal a man who spoke extemporaneously in nearly perfect paragraphs, a collection of lectures is not exactly the same thing as a book. This is especially true when the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author in question never published anything without combing at least twenty or twenty-five iterations of every manuscript for error or stylistic infelicity.</p><p>There was plenty of laughter during these lectures, but also the kind of pin-drop silence that comes when the audience and the speaker are united in the thrall of an idea. The extended dialogues in some of the question-and-answer periods capture a sense of what it was like to explore a question with Carl. I attended every lecture, and more than twenty years later what remains with me was his extraordinary combination of principled, crystal-clear advocacy coupled with respect and tenderness toward those who did not share his views.</p><p>The American psychologist and philosopher William James gave the Gifford Lectures in the first years of the twentieth century. He later turned them into an extraordinarily influential book entitled The Varieties of Religious Experience, which remains in print till this day. Carl admired James&#x2019;s definition of religion as a &#x201c;feeling of being at home in the Universe,&#x201d; quoting it at the conclusion of Pale Blue Dot, his vision of the human future in space. The title of the book you hold in your hands is a tip of the hat to the illustrious tradition of the Gifford Lectures. My variation on James&#x2019;s title is intended to convey that science opens the way to levels of consciousness that are otherwise inaccessible to us; that, contrary to our cultural bias, the only gratification that science denies to us is deception. I hope it also honors the breadth of searching and the richness of insight that distinguished Carl Sagan&#x2019;s indivisible life and work. The varieties of his scientific experience were exemplified by oneness, humility, community, wonder, love, courage, remembrance, openness, and compassion.</p><p>In that same drawer where the transcript of these lectures was rediscovered, there was a sheaf of notes intended for a book we never had the chance to write. Its working title was Ethos, and it would have been our attempt to synthesize the spiritual perspectives we derived from the revelations of science. We collected filing cabinets&#x2019; worth of notes and references on the subject. Among them was a quotation Carl had excerpted from Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646&#x2013;1716), the mathematical and philosophical genius, who had invented differential and integral calculus independently of Isaac Newton. Leibniz argued that God should be the wall that stopped all further questioning, as he famously wrote in this passage from Principles of Nature and Grace:</p><p>&#x201c;Why does something exist rather than nothing? For &#x2018;nothing&#x2019; is simpler than &#x2018;something.&#x2019; Now this sufficient reason for the existence of the universe...which has no need of any other reason...must be a necessary being, else we should not have a sufficient reason with which we could stop.&#x201d;</p><p>And just beneath the typed quote, three small handwritten words in red pen, a message from Carl to Leibniz and to us: &#x201c;So don&#x2019;t stop.&#x201d;</p><br><p>� ANN DRUYAN</p><p>Ithaca, New York</p><p>March 21, 2006</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Author&#x2019;s Introduction</p><p></p><p></p><p>In these lectures I would like, following the wording of the Gifford Trust, to tell you something of my views on what at least...</p></p><h2>Practical Blacksmithing: The Four Classic Volumes in One</h2><p><b>The blacksmith&#x2019;s ABCs&#x2014;learn metalworking as taught by the old masters!</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The forging of metal gave birth to the Iron Age, and <i>Practical Blacksmithing</i> is the classic primer on the craft that shaped modern civilization. Featuring <b>more than 1,000 illustrations</b>, this foundational text describes<b> every aspect of working with iron and steel</b>, and is essential for both the do-it-yourself backyard blacksmith and the professional metalworker.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Originally published in four volumes in the early 20th century, this hefty, single-volume, new edition of <i>Practical Blacksmithing</i> is different from similar books in that it <b>includes contributions by working tradesmen</b>. In addition to its <b>clear and concise instructional material</b>, the book&#x2019;s editor collected the actual words of old-time blacksmiths offering their best methods, unique how-tos, original techniques, and arcane knowledge.<br> &nbsp;<br> Industrialization and mass production may have led to the disappearance of the blacksmith from everyday life, but the art of metalwork never died. It smoldered like hot coals in a forge, and today those coals are red hot as craftsman taking up blacksmithing as a hobby or art form seek to learn the <b>foundational aspects of the trade</b>.<br> &nbsp;<br> Proving that what may be old can actually be new and useful, <i>Practical Blacksmithing</i><b>describes all the important smithing processes: </b>welding, brazing, soldering, cutting, bending, setting, tempering, fullering and swaging, forging, and drilling. It also includes the <b>early history of blacksmithing</b> and describes tools used since ancient times. In addition to <b>thousands of other useful facts</b>, the modern blacksmith will be introduced to old tools and learn how to make them, and can even learn how to build a retro blacksmith shop with detailed do-it-yourself plans!</p><p><p>M.T. Richardson was the editor of an early magazine about blacksmithing. A bible of the trade, <i>Practical Blacksmithing</i> collects his extensive knowledge and, in his own words, &#x201c;a variety of practical information formed of contributions of hundreds of able workmen scattered over a wide area.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p></p><h2>The House of Rothschild: Volume 2: The World&#39;s Banker: 1849-1999</h2><p><b>A major work of economic, social and political history, Niall Ferguson's <i>The House of Rothschild: The World's Banker 1849-1999</i> is the second volume of the acclaimed, landmark history of the legendary Rothschild banking dynasty.<br><br></b>Niall Ferguson's <i>House of Rothschild: Money's Prophets 1798-1848</i> was hailed as a "great biography" by <i>Time</i> magazine and named one of the best books of the year by <i>Business Week</i>.&nbsp;Now, with all the depth, clarity and drama with which he traced their ascent, Ferguson - the first historian with access to the long-lost Rothschild family archives - concludes his myth-breaking portrait of once of the most fascinating and power families of all time.<p>From Crimea to World War II, wars repeatedly threatened the stability of the Rothschilds' worldwide empire. Despite these many global upheavals, theirs remained the biggest bank in the world up until the First World War, their interests extending far beyond the realm of finance. Yet the Rothschilds' failure to establish themselves successfully in the United States proved fateful, and as financial power shifted from London to New York after 1914, their power waned.<br><br>"A stupendous achievement, a triumph of historical research and imagination."<i>&#x2014;</i><b>Robert Skidelsky, </b><i><b>The New York Review of Books</b><br><br></i>"Niall Ferguson's brilliant and altogether enthralling two-volume family saga proves that academic historians can still tell great stories that the rest of us want to read."<b><i>&#x2014;</i></b><i><b>The New York Times Book Review</b><br><br></i>"Superb ...

In the aftermath of the Napoleonic revolution, European Jews had been able to move within dominant societies somewhat more freely. Of no family was this more true than the Rothschilds, whose branches lived in Germany, France, Austria, and England, and whose vast financial empire enabled them to act as diplomats and power brokers throughout the world. Their influence was enormous. When Spain wanted to build a railroad, its ministers approached the House of Rothschild. When the Confederate States of America sought to be recognized by the states of Europe, it sought--unsuccessfully--the Rothschilds' support. When Ferdinand de Lesseps broke ground for the Panama Canal and Cecil Rhodes broke ground for his vast diamond and gold mines in South Africa, Rothschild funds backed them.<p> Until the 1920s, Ferguson demonstrates, there was almost no economic, technological, or political development in Europe in which the House of Rothschild did not play some role. The rise of nationalist and national socialist movements and of official anti-Semitism, coupled with the rise in the Jazz Age of a new generation of Rothschilds that cared more for the good life than for the hard work of maintaining their holdings, led to a substantial decline in the family's authority and wealth. But even today, as Ferguson writes in this richly detailed but eminently readable history, the Rothschilds figure in European finance, continuing a legacy that Ferguson's two volumes trace from the Middle Ages to the new millennium. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Niall Ferguson is one of the world's most renowned historians.

Over the centuries, the church has identified several themes--such as love and covenant--that have helped the faithful to better understand a sometimes bewildering book.<br><br>In Holy People, Holy Land, authors Dauphinais and Levering make the case that holiness--which they define as communion with God through love of neighbor--is the central theme of Scripture. Holy People, Holy Land will give any reader the tools to better understand Scripture by showing how a holy God desires to recreate his children in his image so that they too can be holy.</p><p><b>Michael Dauphinais </b>(Ph.D., University of Notre Dame) is associate dean of faculty and associate professor of theology at Ave Maria University in Naples, Florida. <b>Matthew Levering</b> (Ph.D., Boston College) is professor of theology at the University of Dayton in Dayton, Ohio. Dauphinais and Levering are coauthors of <i>Knowing the Love of Christ.</i>Starred Review. The authors, associate professors of theology at Ave Maria University in Naples, Fla., present the narrative of the Bible in the context of God's passion for restoring humankind to a state of original holiness. They consider holiness&#x2014;defined as a condition of balance and innocence before God and his creation&#x2014;to be the underlying theme of all scripture. As such, it provides a paradigm for God's intervention in human affairs, unifying sacred history as the record of God's reaching out to a world in need of grace. The authors sidestep questions of historicity and authorship, focusing instead on the biblical stories as reflections of God's hand in human affairs. As the title suggests, they chart a pattern of holiness, not just in people, but in the land the people possess. This theme builds until the final chapter, which addresses the restoration of holiness of person and place, a future time when "the people of the new covenant have become the righteous dwelling place of God." Although written for undergraduate theology students and fraught with intimidating-looking footnotes, the material is easily grasped by the average reader and is highly recommended for Catholics and Protestants alike. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

To that end, historian Gerald Horne digs deeply into Europe&#x2019;s colonization of Africa and the New World, when, from Columbus&#x2019;s arrival until the Civil War, some 13 million Africans and some 5 million Native Americans were forced to build and cultivate a society extolling &#x201c;liberty and justice for all.&#x201d; The seventeenth century was, according to Horne, an era when the roots of slavery, white supremacy, and capitalism became inextricably tangled into a complex history involving war and revolts in Europe, England&#x2019;s conquest of the Scots and Irish, the development of formidable new weaponry able to ensure Europe&#x2019;s colonial dominance, the rebel merchants of North America who created &#x201c;these United States,&#x201d; and the hordes of Europeans whose newfound opportunities in this &#x201c;free&#x201d; land amounted to &#x201c;combat pay&#x201d; for their efforts as &#x201c;white&#x201d; settlers. <br><br>Centering his book on the Eastern Seaboard of North America, the Caribbean, Africa, and what is now Great Britain, Horne provides a deeply researched, harrowing account of the apocalyptic loss and misery that likely has no parallel in human history. This is an essential book that will not allow history to be told by the victors. It is especially needed now, in the age of Trump.

Her work has been praised by a wide range of distinguished psychologists and educators, and she has conducted creativity seminars and workshops for leading businesses including IBM and General Electric.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>Creativity: The Chameleon Concept</b><br><br>What on earth is creativity? How can a concept be so important in human thinking, so crucial to human history, so dearly valued by nearly everyone yet be so elusive?<br><br>Creativity has been studied, analyzed, dissected, documented. Educators discuss the concept as if it were a tangible thing, a goal to be attained like the ability to divide numbers or play the violin. Cognitive scientists, fascinated by creativity, have produced volumes of bits and pieces, offering tantalizing glimpses and hints, but have not put the parts together into an understandable whole. To date we still have no generally accepted definition of creativity -- no general agreement on what it is, how to learn it, how to teach it, or if, indeed, it can be learned or taught. Even the dictionary finesses definition with a single cryptic phrase: <i>"creativity:</i> the ability to create," and my encyclopedia avoids the difficulty altogether with no entry, even though another admittedly elusive concept, "intelligence," is allotted a full-length column of fine print. Nevertheless, books abound on the subject as seekers after creativity pursue a concept that seems paradoxically to recede at the same pace at which the pursuers advance.<br><br><b>Drawing on Treasure-Hunt Notes</b><br><br>The trail, fortunately, is at least marked with pointers to guide the chase. Letters and personal records, journals, eyewitness accounts, descriptions, and biographies are in abundance, gathered from creative individuals and their biographers over past centuries. Like clues in a treasure hunt, these notations spur the quest, even though (as in any good treasure hunt) they often seem illogical and indeed frequently contradict each other to confuse the searcher.<br><br>Recurring themes and ideas in the notes, however, do reveal some hazy outlines of the creative process. The picture looks like this: the creative individual, whose mind is stored with impressions, is caught up with an idea or a problem that defies solution despite prolonged study. A period of uneasiness or distress often ensues. Suddenly, without conscious volition, the mind is focused and a moment of insight occurs, often reported to be a profoundly moving experience. The individual is subsequently thrown into a period of concentrated thought (or work) during which the insight is <i>fixed</i> into some tangible form, unfolding, as it were, into the form it was intended to possess from the moment of conception.<br><br>This basic description of the nature of the creative process has been around since antiquity. The story of Archimedes' sudden insight, while he was sitting in the bathtub mulling over the problem of how to determine the relative quantities of gold and silver in the king's crown, has put his exclamation "Eureka!" (I have found it!) permanently into the language as the "Ah-Ha!" of creativity.<br><br><b>A Scaffolding of Stages</b><br><br>Successive steps in the creative process, however, were not categorized until late in the nineteenth century, when the German physiologist and physicist Herman Helmholtz described his own scientific discoveries in terms of three specific stages. Helmholtz named the first stage of research <i>saturation;</i> the second, mulling-over stage <i>incubation;</i> and the third stage, the sudden solution, <i>illumination.</i><br><br>Helmholtz' three stages were supplemented in 1908 by a fourth stage, <i>verification,</i> suggested by the great French mathematician Henri Poincar�. Poincar� described the stage of verification as one of putting the solution into concrete form while checking it for error and usefulness.<br><br>Then, in the early 1960s, the American psychologist Jacob Getzels contributed the important idea of a stage that <i>precedes</i> Helmholtz' saturation: a preliminary stage of problem <i>finding</i> or <i>formulating.</i> Getzels pointed out that creativity is not just solving problems of the kind that already exist or that continually arise in human life. Creative individuals often actively <i>search out</i> and discover problems to solve that no one else has perceived. As Albert Einstein and Max Wertheimer state in the margin quotations, to ask a productive question is a creative act in itself. Another American psychologist, George Kneller, named Getzel's preliminary stage <i>first insight</i> -- a term that encompasses both problem solving (of existing problems) and problem finding (asking new and searching questions).<br><br>Thus we have an approximate structure of five stages in the creative process: 1. First Insight 2. Saturation 3. Incubation 4. Illumination 5. Verification. These stages progress over time from one stage to the next. Each stage may occupy varying lengths of time, as indicated in the diagrams below, and the time lengths may possibly be infinitely variable. Only Illumination is in almost every case reported to be brief-a flash of light thrown on the subject. With the notable exception of the Gestalt psychologists, for whom creativity is an unsegmented process, a single consistent line of thinking for the purpose of solving a <i>whole</i> problem, researchers have generally agreed on the basic concept that creativity involves progressive stages which occur over varying lengths of time.<br><br>Building on this sketchy outline, however, twentieth-century researchers have continued to embellish the elusive concept of creativity and debate its various aspects. Like Alice in Wonderland, it has undergone one transformation after another, thus increasing one's sense that despite a general notion of its overall configuration, this chameleon concept will forever change before our eyes and escape understanding.<br><br>And now the concept is metamorphosing again. Changes in modern life, occurring at an increasingly rapid pace, require innovative responses, thus making it imperative that we gain greater understanding of creativity and control over the creative process. This necessity, coupled with the age-old yearning of individuals to express themselves creatively, has markedly enhanced interest in the concept of creativity, as is shown in the growing number of publications on the subject.<br><br>In these publications, one question explored by many writers is whether creativity is rare or widespread among the general population. And the question "Am I creative?" is one we all ask ourselves. The answer to both questions seems to depend on something we usually call "talent" -- the idea that either you have a <i>talent</i> for creativity or you don't. But is it really as simple as that? And just what is talent?<br><br><b>Talent: The Slippery Concept</b><br><br>The drawing course I teach is usually described in the college catalog as follows: "Art 100: Studio Art for Non-Art Majors. This is a course designed for persons who cannot draw at all, who feel they have no talent for drawing, and who believe they probably can never learn to draw."<br><br>The response to this description has been overwhelming: my classes are always full to overflowing. But invariably one or more of the newly enrolled students approaches me at the start of the course to say, "I just want to let you know that even though you've taught a lot of people how to draw, <i>I am your Waterloo!</i> I'm the one who will <i>never</i> be able to learn!"<br><br>When I ask why, again almost invariably the answer is "Because I have no talent." "Well," I answer, "let's wait and see."<br><br>Sure enough, a few weeks later, students who claimed to have no talent are happily drawing away on the same high level of accomplishment as the rest of the class. But even then, they often discount their newly acquired skill by attributing it to something they call <i>"hidden</i> talent."<br><br><b>Turning the Tables on this Strange Situation</b><br><br>I believe the time has come to reexamine our traditional beliefs about creative talent -- "hidden" or otherwise. Why do we assume that a rare and special "artistic" talent is required for drawing? We don't make that assumption about other kinds of abilities -- reading, for example.<br><br>What if we believed that only those fortunate enough to have an innate, God-given, genetic gift for reading will be able to learn to read? What if teachers believed that the best way to go about the teaching of reading is simply to supply lots of reading materials for children to handle and manipulate and then wait to see what happens? Such a teacher would, of course, never tamper with a child's spontaneous attempts to read for fear of spoiling "creativity" in reading. If a child asked, "How do you read this?" the teacher would respond, "Just be free! Do what comes into your head. Use your imagination and just enjoy it! Reading should be fun!" Then the teacher would watch to see which children showed "talent" for reading -- the idea being that it's no use trying to teach the skill of reading because if a child isn't "talented," instruction won't help.<br><br>It's easy to see that if this were the situation in reading classes, probably only one or two or perhaps three children in a class of twenty-five might somehow manage to learn how to read. <i>They</i> would be designated as "talented" for reading, and no doubt someone would say, "Well, you know, Sally's grandmother was good at reading. Sally probably got it from her." Or "Oh, yes, Billy's good at reading. The family is quite literate, you know. It's in the genes, I guess." Meanwhile, the rest of the children would grow up saying of themselves, <i>"I can't read.</i> I haven't got any talent for it, and I'm sure I could <i>never</i> learn."<br><br>What I've described, of course, is more or less the way it is with drawing. Surely parents would object mightily if the concept of talent were used as a roadblock in learning to read the way it is used in learning to draw. But for some reason, most people, parents <i>and</i> students, accept the verdict "No talent for drawing" with quite surprising meekness and even crestfallen agreement.<br><br>This situation continues right up to college art classes. There, anxious students, already worded because their drawing skills are weak and fearful that they have no talent, are sometimes confronted on the first day by an instructor who might start the course with "Well, there's the still-life setup. Do a drawing of it." All too often the students fear an implied warning: "...and we'll see which of you should stay in this class."<br><br>A comparable situation might be to enroll in a beginning French conversation class and to be told at the start, "Go ahead and talk in French," with an implied warning that if you can't already speak French, you shouldn't bother to stay. Very few college students in art classes, I imagine, would stand for that. Yet students usually don't object to noninstruction, as they surely would in almost any other course, perhaps because they feel so bad -- almost guilty -- that they have no "talent" for drawing.<br><br>Talent is, indeed, a slippery concept, no matter what the form of creativity. But perhaps "artistic talent" has always <i>seemed</i> rare and out of the ordinary only because we <i>expect</i> it to be rare and out of the ordinary. We have become accustomed to thinking of artistic ability as basically unteachable, and teaching methods have remained unexamined. Moreover, many educators, parents, and students have shared an unspoken belief that artistic abilities are largely nonessential in our modern, technological society.<br><br>Yet we do value creativity. We constantly seek ways in which to be more creative ourselves, whatever our occupations or fields of interest. But must we have a mysterious God-given talent to be creative? Or is it possible that creativity <i>can</i> be taught?<br><br><b>The Basic Skills of Thinking</b><br><br>In my work with groups of artistically untrained people, I have discovered that any person of sound mind can learn to draw; the probability is the same as for learning to read. It is simply a matter of learning basic perceptual skills -- the special ways of seeing required for drawing. I claim that anyone can learn enough <i>seeing</i> skills to draw a good likeness of something seen "out there" in the real world.<br><br>Once these basic perceptual skills are learned, their use can be as varied as subsequent uses of basic language and arithmetic skills. A few individuals may stay with art and eventually become artists, just as a few stay with language or mathematics and eventually become writers or mathematicians. But almost everyone can use perceptual skills -- again, like language and math skills -- to enhance <i>thinking</i> skills.<br><br>To go a step further, I propose that perceptual skills are deeply involved in the five stages of the creative process. I also propose that visual, perceptual skills are enhanced by training, just as the verbal, analytic skills benefit by education. And finally, I propose that learning to see and draw is a very efficient way to train the visual system, just as learning to read and write can efficiently train the verbal system. That is not to say that the visual system is better, morally or otherwise, than the verbal system. But the two systems <i>are</i> different. And when trained as equal partners, one mode of thinking enhances the other, and together the two modes can release human creativity.<br><br><b>Summing Up a Point of View</b><br><br>At present, our culture provides few opportunities for such training. We are used to thinking by means of the language system of the brain, and that mode has proved its effectiveness over the centuries. But we are only now beginning to understand the complex dual functions, verbal <i>and</i> visual, of the human brain, and new possibilities are opening up. As I see it, unlocking the doors to perception and releasing the potential for creativity is a twofold process: first, removal of the deterrent concept of talent as a requirement for learning basic perceptual skills; second, teaching and learning based on new knowledge of how the human brain works.<br><br>My claim is quite modest: if you can catch a baseball, thread a needle, or hold a pencil and write your name, you can learn to draw skillfully, artistically, and creatively. Through learning to draw perceived objects or persons, you can learn new ways of seeing that guide strategies in creative thinking and problem solving just as, through learning to read, you acquire verbal knowledge and learn the strategies of logical, analytical thought. Using the two modes together, you can learn to think more productively, whatever your creative goals may be. The products of your creative responses to the world will be uniquely your own, your mark on the world. And you will have taken a giant step toward attaining a <i>modern</i> brain. For in the years ahead, I believe that perceptual skills combined with verbal skills will be viewed as the basic necessities for creative human thought.<br><br>Copyright � 1986 by Betty Edwards</p><h2>The Reconnection: Heal Others, Heal Yourself</h2><p>Why are prominent doctors and medical researchers all over the world interested in the extraordinary healings reported by the patients of Dr. Eric Pearl?

Scott Momaday, John Trudell, and very few others, Joy Harjo is an essential Native American literary voice. She counts among her devoted readers Marge Piercy, Adrienne Rich, and Sandra Cisneros; her writing is infused with a generosity of spirit that accounts for much of her appeal. Dancing children, the attempt to heal a broken life, rising moons, and blue horses turning into streaks of lightning are the images Harjo uses to spin her yarns, and her words are spellbinding. Her talent is manifest in "A Postcolonial Tale": "Every day is a reenactment of the creation story. We emerge from dense unspeakable material, through the shimmering power of dreaming stuff." And in "Wolf Warrior": "A white butterfly speckled with pollen joined me in my prayers yesterday as I thought of you in Washington." There is a lot of magic and a lot of hope woven through the dark backdrop of the poems in <i>The Woman Who Fell from the Sky</i>. Harjo is a treasure.Joy Harjo is an internationally renowned performer and writer of the Muscogee Creek Nation and was named United States Poet Laureate in 2019. The author of eight books of poetry and a memoir, Crazy Brave, her many honors include the Jackson Poetry Prize, the Ruth Lilly Prize, a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Josephine Miles Poetry Award, the William Carlos Williams Award, and the American Indian Distinguished Achievement in the Arts Award.

JOHN</b> (1919-1993) was a nurse, missionary and author. She earned a nursing degree at St. Thomas� Hospital in London in 1946. In the early 1950�s she moved to Tangier, Morocco where she served as a missionary nurse for 27 years. Throughout her life, she travelled extensively in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, as the settings of her novels reflect. In 1977, she returned to England, where she cared for elderly relatives and ministered from her home to youths, single parents, and the elderly.

Auden</h2><p>This significantly expanded edition of W. H. Auden&#x2019;s <i>Selected Poems </i>adds twenty poems to the hundred in the original edition, broadening its focus to better reflect the enormous wealth of form, rhetoric, tone, and content in Auden&#x2019;s work. Newly included are such favorites as &#x201c;Funeral Blues&#x201d; and other works that represent Auden&#x2019;s lighter, comic side, giving a fuller picture of the range of his genius. Also new are brief notes explaining references that may have become obscure to younger generations of readers and a revised introduction that draws on recent additions to knowledge about Auden.<br><br>As in the original edition, the new <i>Selected Poems </i>makes available the preferred original versions of some thirty poems that Auden revised later in life, making it the best source for enjoying the many facets of Auden&#x2019;s art in one volume.</p><p>This edition presents the original versions of many poems, which Auden revised to conform to his evolving political and literary attitudes later in his career. In this volume, Edward Mendelson has restored the early versions of some thirty poems generally considered to be superior to the later versions, allowing the reader to see the entire range of Auden&#39;s work. Selected and edited by Edward MendelsonW. H. Auden (1907-73) was born in York, England, and educated at Oxford. During the 1930s he was the leader of a left-wing literary group that included Christopher Isherwood and Stephen Spender. With Isherwood he wrote three verse plays. He lived in Germany during the early days of Nazism, and was a stretcher-bearer for the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War. Auden's first volume of poetry appeared in 1930. Later volumes include <i>Spain</i> (1937), <i>New Year Letter</i> (1941), <i>For the Time Being</i>, a <i>Christmas Oratorio</i> (1945), <i>The Age of Anxiety</i> (1947; Pulitzer Prize), <i>Nones</i> (1951), <i>The Shield of Achilles</i> (1955), <i>Homage to Clio </i>(1960), <i>About the House</i> (1965), <i>Epistle of a Godson</i> (1972), and <i>Thank You, Fog</i> (1974). His other works include the libretto, with his companion Chester Kallman, for Stravinsky's opera <i>The Rake's Progress</i> (1953); <i>A Certain World: A Commonplace Book</i> (1970); and <i>The Dyer's Hand and Other Essays</i> (1968). In 1939 Auden moved to the United States and became a citizen in 1946, and beginning that year taught at a number of American colleges and universities. From 1956 to 1961 he was professor of poetry at Oxford. Subsequently he lived in a number of countries, including Italy and Austria, and in 1971 he returned to England.

The real lives of this motley crew-which included cross-dressing women, people of color, and the'outcasts of all nations'-are far more compelling than contemporary myth.</p><p>Marcus Rediker is professor of history at the University of Pittsburgh. He is author of <i>Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea</i> and coauthor of <i>The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic</i>, which won the International Labor History Association Book Prize in 2001. He lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and is at work on a history of the slave ship.Rediker (<i>Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea</i>), a historian of maritime labor, opens his immensely readable study of the "golden age" of piracy (1716-1726) with the spectacle of an execution in which a notorious pirate, unrepentant and seemingly unconcerned to be facing death, reties the knot of his gallows noose with defiant ironic humor. For Rediker, pirates were bold subversives who challenged the prevailing social order and empire building of the five main trading nations. Emphasizing the hardship, injustice and brutality the average sailor faced in his career, Rediker suggests that piracy offered a more egalitarian seafaring life, as well as opportunities for revenge on the ruling class. Rediker uses captives' accounts, among other sources, to show how pirates meted out their own system of justice, torturing captains reputed for their harsh treatment of sailors, yet sparing others known for fairness. He explores pirate dialects, rituals and symbols, and shows how pirates inverted social norms, creating a carnivalesque way of life that featured fraternal solidarity, a precapitalist share system and the wanton destruction of property. A chapter on picaresque women pirates reveals links between their iconic image and Delacroix's painting <i>Liberty.</i> Using statistics to show convincingly that by the 1720s piracy posed a real threat to global trade, Rediker describes how nations launched a military-legal campaign against piracy, with cannon battles and gruesome public executions. Rediker uses this apocalyptic close of piracy's golden age to explore its suicidal side. Although Rediker's short study does not tackle later myths of piracy, it provides penetrating background to our enduring cultural fascination with the seafaring outlaws.

This left many women with the options of making their own clothes or hiring a seamstress.<br>While a number of economy-minded women did sew simple housedresses, and clothing for their children, many took favorite fashion plates to a dressmaker who would often consult patterns in a magazine such as <i>The Voice of Fashion</i>. This book, compiled by costume authority Kristina Harris, painstakingly reprints a rich selection of scaled dressmakers' patterns of the 1890s, taken from rare issues of that popular, late-19th century dressmaker's journal. Featuring such fashion elements as leg-o'-mutton sleeves, high-collared necklines, long skirts, and pinched waistlines, the collection includes nearly 500 patterns and illustrations detailing 50 garments for women. Every wardrobe necessity for the Victorian lady is covered &#x2014; from nightgowns and wrappers for boudoir and breakfast, a riding habit and tennis outfit, to walking dresses for town and visiting, elegant dinner dresses, and elaborate evening gowns.<br>An introduction and brief instruction for using the patterns are also included in a volume that will not only find practical use among costume designers and students of fashion history, but will also delight browsers, Victorian enthusiasts, and anyone intrigued by the evolution of clothing styles. 498 illustrations.</p><p></p><h2>The Sisters: The Saga of the Mitford Family</h2><p><p><strong>"Fascinating, the way all great family stories are fascinating."&#x2015;Robert Gottlieb, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong></p> This is the story of a close, loving family splintered by the violent ideologies of Europe between the world wars. Jessica was a Communist; Debo became the Duchess of Devonshire; Nancy was one of the best-selling novelists of her day; beautiful Diana married the Fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley; and Unity, a close friend of Hitler, shot herself in the head when England and Germany declared war.<br><br> The Mitfords had style and presence and were mercilessly gifted. Above all, they were funny&#x2015;hilariously and mercilessly so. In this wise, evenhanded, and generous book, Mary Lovell captures the vitality and drama of a family that took the twentieth century by storm and became, in some respects, its victims. 24 b/w photographs</p><p>Mary S. Lovell&#39;s best-selling biographies include Straight on Till Morning (Beryl Markham) and The Sisters (the Mitford family). She lives in England.In her history of England's Mitford sisters, who were major figures in the international political, literary and social scenes for much of the 20th century, Lovell (The Sound of Wings: The Biography of Amelia Earhart; etc.) rises with aplomb to the challenges of a group biography, deftly weaving together the narrative threads of six at times radically disparate lives to create a fascinating account of a fascinating family. Born into the ranks of the minor aristocracy and educated at home by eccentric and perennially cash-strapped parents, Nancy, Pamela, Diana, Unity, Jessica and Deborah Mitford hardly seemed the types whose exploits would generate endless fodder for the sensationalist press. But when Diana left her wealthy young husband to take up with and eventually marry Sir Oswald Mosley, infamous leader of British fascism; when Unity became close friends with Adolf Hitler and a proponent of Nazism; when Jessica, a vocal Communist, eloped with a notorious cousin who was also a nephew of Winston Churchill; when Deborah married the Duke of Devonshire; and when both Nancy (Love in a Cold Climate) and Jessica (The American Way of Death) became acclaimed, bestselling authors, the world responded with avid, insatiable and at times alarmingly intrusive curiosity. But whether adored or reviled by their public, all the Mitford sisters were engaged with (and at times embodiments of) the major social and political issues of their time. Lovell's account of the sisters' upbringing and their often tumultuous adult lives is as lively and engrossing as Nancy's heavily autobiographical fiction; the group biography also does a commendable job of separating the myths that fiction created from the sometimes more mundane realities of the Mitfords' activities and relationships. 16 pages of photos not seen by PW. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Fieldwork in Ukrainian Sex</h2><p>Called &#x201c;the most influential Ukrainian book for the 15 years of independence,&#x201d; Oksana Zabuzhko&#x2019;s <em>Fieldwork in Ukrainian Sex </em>became an international phenomenon when it shot to number one on the Ukrainian bestseller list and remained there throughout the 1990s. The novel is narrated in first-person streams of thought by a sharp-tongued poet with an irreverently honest voice. She is visiting professor of Slavic studies at Harvard and her exposure to American values and behaviors conspires with her yearning to break free from Ukrainian conventions. In her despair over a recently ended affair, she turns her attention to the details of her lover&#x2019;s abusive behavior. In detailing the power her Ukrainian lover wielded over her, and in admitting the underlying reasons for her attraction to him, she begins to see the chains that have defined her as a Ukrainian woman &#x2013; and in doing so, exposes and calls into question her country&#x2019;s culture of fear and repression at the very time that it wrestled its way toward independence.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: A Q&amp;A with Oksana Zabuzhko</strong> <br> <br> First published in the Ukraine in 1996, Oksana Zabuzhko&#x2019;s <em>Fieldwork in Ukrainian Sex</em> unleashed a storm of controversy and propelled the author to international fame. It topped the bestseller list in Ukraine for more than ten years, making it the most successful Ukrainian-language book of the nineties in every regard. Today Zabuzhko is one of the few authors in Ukraine (and the only Ukrainian-language writer) to make a living exclusively from her writing. <br><br>Intrigued by her success and her book, which PEN American Center has called &#x201c;a brilliant, suggestive portrait of the heretofore suppressed private lives of Eastern European women,&#x201d; our editors sat down with Oksana Zabuzhko for an exclusive Q&amp;A. <strong><br><br>Question:</strong> Your book was considered controversial for its provocative and &#x201c;taboo&#x201d; topics when it was first released in 1996&#x2014;in many ways it provoked in the Ukraine a similar response as Betty Friedan&#x2019;s <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> did in the United States in the 1960s. What drove you to write this book? <p></p> <p><strong>Oksana Zabuzhko:</strong> My having been born and grown up as a woman in the Soviet Ukraine. When you turn 30, you inevitably start reconsidering what you have been taught in your formative years--that is, if you really seek your own voice as a writer. In my case, my personal identity crisis had coincided with the one experienced by my country after the advent of independence. The result turned explosive: <em>Fieldwork in Ukrainian Sex</em>, the story of one woman&#x2019;s "personal revolt," provoked the top literary scandal of the decade. Now, 14 years after its first publication, the novel is regarded as a "contemporary classic," the milestone in new Ukrainian writings etc., but when I was writing it, it felt simply like a case of "write or die.&#x201d;</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Is the book auto-biographical?</p> <p><strong>Oksana Zabuzhko:</strong> The narrator bears my first name, and was given a lot out of my own life experience. I guess <em>Fieldwork</em> can be called confessional literature. Of course, it is, in many ways, an autobiographical novel (and which novel is not&#x2014;starting with <em>Madame Bovary</em>?), but it can hardly be regarded as a pure documentary, a non-fiction (no one but myself knows how many things in there are in fact &#x201c;the products of the author&#x2019;s imagination,&#x201d; whatever this formula may stand for!). The reason for giving the narrator my first name, as well as much of my own biography (literary career, teaching at American universities, growing up under the Soviet regime in a Ukrainian dissident&#x2019;s family) was at first merely intuitional&#x2014;nearly all my friends who had read the manuscript suggested that I &#x201c;change the names,&#x201d; but I stubbornly rejected that advice. It wasn&#x2019;t until the simultaneous outbursts of ecstasy and indignation came, and the reading public split into two opposing camps, that I said to myself: Hey, woman, weren&#x2019;t you right! For you see, if the novel was to articulate certain things which Ukrainian literature has never articulated before, and be heard, all these dark and dirty secrets HAD to be pronounced &#x201c;in the first person,&#x201d; as a part of the author&#x2019;s most personal existential experience. Or, to put it briefly: to win the reader&#x2019;s trust, you sometimes need to pay with your own blood. In the end, that&#x2019;s what literature is all about, isn&#x2019;t it?</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> How does <em>Fieldwork in Ukrainian Se</em>x compare to your previous works?</p> <p><strong>Oksana Zabuzhko:</strong> It is generally regarded as my first "commercial book," even though I had previously published three collections of poetry, stories, and a literary study. For me, <em>Fieldwork in Ukrainian Sex</em> has become an act of my personal liberation, not the least of the linguistic kind--since with this novel I knew for sure I was a "language writer." For Ukrainian literature, it turned out to be a book which has dramatically changed the literary landscape, and brought to life a whole new generation of women authors (dubbed by critics as "Zabuzhko&#x2019;s daughters").</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> You&#x2019;ve clearly had an impact on other female writers in your home country. What authors or books have influenced your writing?</p> <p><strong>Oksana Zabuzhko:</strong> I am afraid I might now confuse my own memories with the influences ascribed to me by critics (this book has been translated in some 12 countries, and from country to country the set of "the names of influence" varies). The most immediate challenge was Milan Kundera: I used to admire his skill to use sex as a tool to both portray the characters and construct the plot, yet I have always found his macho attitudes annoying. My ambition was to try a similar "sex game" on a woman&#x2019;s part. This is why, of all the praise this novel has received, the one comparison which made me the happiest was a Czech review in which I was named "Lady Kundera." So, I made it work after all!</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Have you always wanted to write? What other careers have you pursued?</p> <p><strong>Oksana Zabuzhko:</strong> I have wanted to be an author since I was five. Only my parents' blacklisting by the KGB helped keep me from publishing in my teens. It is the only thing for which I am truly grateful to the late USSR, for there are few things as certain to destroy "a career writer" as the premature start.</p> <p>In my school years, music and theater were two other strong temptations. Later I studied philosophy, and obtained a degree in the philosophy of arts. I have also taught at several universities in Ukraine and abroad (including Harvard, Penn State, and the University of Pittsburgh in the U.S.), and worked as a newspaper columnist. Since 1996, when <em>Fieldwork in Ukrainian Sex</em> was published, I have been living as a freelance writer.</p> <strong>Question:</strong> What's next for you? <p><strong>Oksana Zabuzhko:</strong> I have in my mind quite a list of things which I want yet to write about, yet, despite the fact that over the past 15 years I did manage to cross several lines off as "done," the list keeps growing. For example, while I was doing research on my recently published novel, <em>The Museum of the Abandoned Secrets</em>, I came upon some documents which pressed the button for long-silenced memories to surface. But I&#x2019;d rather not discuss my next work until the title is set&#x2014;this is one of my writing superstitions.</p> <p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: An Essay by Translator Halyna Hryn</strong></p> <p><em>Fieldwork in Ukrainian Sex</em> is an unusual work&#x2014;it is not light fiction intended to entertain (although it can certainly do that); rather it is an urgent, inspired exposition of one woman&#x2019;s fight to catch her bearings, land on her feet, after life had thrown her a particularly nasty curveball. At the heart of the story is a failed relationship, and here the author&#x2019;s unflinching courage in dissecting the how-and-why is most gripping. What makes us love so that we overlook the abuse (and is it really abuse?) that ultimately makes our love unsustainable? What do we do with the shame? At the time and place of its initial publication (post-Soviet Ukraine, 1996), this book indeed had the effect of a bombshell, but it continues to make us uncomfortable even now. Praise and opprobrium have tended to fall along gender lines in Ukraine. It will be interesting to see the response to the English language version.</p> <p>The larger story that envelops the love affair is, of course, the story of Ukraine itself, so unexpectedly liberated with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, coming to grips with its suppressed history, martyrology, searching for its identity together with the heroine. The conceit is a series of lectures in which the heroine explains herself and her country to a North American audience. The task is not easy: Zabuzhko&#x2019;s sentences go on for a page or more at a time; she demands both trust and sustained effort, and it is up to each reader how far they are willing to travel along this road. Translation is not merely a matter of words: it opens windows into an entirely unfamiliar way of contemplating the world. (When you see a sports match where you don&#x2019;t know the players: is your instinct to cheer for the winners or the losers? Does supporting the losers strike you as absurd?)</p> <p>I have read with great interest the reader reviews that have been posted on the Amazon site. They show the full range of an intelligent reading audience and allow me to see what was successful and what was not in my own translation. The &#x201c;stream of consciousness&#x201d; long, pulsating sentences have frustrated some. I had decided not to destroy this basic architecture of the work in the translation, although it does do pose a challenge for both translator and reader. Word order is somewhat different in Ukrainian: in these long sentences the last word of each phrase is the crucial link to the subsequent phrase and so it must go at the end whether it&#x2019;s the natural place for it in English or not, otherwise the link is broken and the edifice collapses. Hence the somewhat foreign cadence that some have noticed. Likewise with pronouns: in many European languages the verb endings make the use of personal pronouns redundant. In English, however, they need to be reinstated so that we know whether I, you, he, she, it or they &#x201c;are speaking&#x201d;&#x2014;add the politically correct &#x201c;he or she,&#x201d; &#x201c;him or her,&#x201d; and several rounds of editors, and the final effect can be less than optimal. I appreciate all your comments and will be happy to respond to any questions.</p> <p>For me, <em>Fieldwork in Ukrainian Sex</em> is a thoughtful, exhilarating and ultimately brilliant literary text, and I am proud to help bring it to the English-speaking reader. I hope you will feel the same.</p>&#x201c;Language &#x2013; any language &#x2013; that&#x2019;s what I would call the capital love of my life: nothing else has the power to synthesize music and myth, two things without which the world would be a totally unlivable place.&#x201d; &#x2013; Oksana Zabuzhko <br><br>&#x201c;Oksana Zabuzkho&#x2019;s poetry effervesces with the joys of inwardness--irony, sorrow, compassion and that aching sense of love that &#x2018;turns bones into flutes.&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x2013; <em>L.A. Times </em><br><br>&#x201c;Oksana Zabuzhko is a well-known Ukrainian poet of the younger generation as well as a literary critic and translator. <em>Fieldwork in Ukrainian Sex</em>, her debut in the genre of the novel, marks the emergence of a powerful new voice in Ukrainian belle-lettres. This work immediately strikes the reader with its novelty of form and with the original way it presents eternal issues like love, life, and creativity, intertwining them with uniquely Ukrainian themes.&#x201d; &#x2013; <em>Slavic and East European Journal </em><br><br><em>Fieldwork in Ukrainian Sex</em> was first published in the Ukraine in 1996, unleashing a storm of controversy and propelling the author to national fame. It topped the bestseller list in Ukraine for more than ten years, making it the most successful Ukrainian-language book of the nineties in every regard. Today Oksana Zabuzhko is one of the few authors in Ukraine (and the only Ukrainian-language writer) to make a living exclusively from her writing.</p><h2>Chevrolet Camaro (82-92) Haynes Repair Manual (Haynes Repair Manuals)</h2><p>Haynes disassembles every subject vehicle and documents every step with thorough instructions and clear photos.

This profound insight, along with Einstein's equally momentous theories of relativity, completely revolutionized man's view of matter, energy, and the nature of physics itself.<br>In this lucid layman's introduction to quantum theory, an eminent physicist and noted popularizer of science traces the development of quantum theory from the turn of the century to about 1930 &#x2014; from Planck's seminal concept (still developing) to anti-particles, mesons, and Enrico Fermi's nuclear research. Gamow was not just a spectator at the theoretical breakthroughs which fundamentally altered our view of the universe, he was an active participant who made important contributions of his own. This "insider's" vantage point lends special validity to his careful, accessible explanations of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, Niels Bohr's model of the atom, the pilot waves of Louis de Broglie and other path-breaking ideas.<br>In addition, Gamow recounts a wealth of revealing personal anecdotes which give a warm human dimension to many giants of 20th-century physics. He ends the book with the Blegdamsvej <i>Faust</i>, a delightful play written in 1932 by Niels Bohr's students and colleagues to satirize the epochal developments that were revolutionizing physics. This celebrated play is available only in this volume.<br>Written in a clear, lively style, and enhanced by 12 photographs (including candid shots of Rutherford, Bohr, Pauli, Heisenberg, Fermi, and others), <i>Thirty Years that Shook Physics</i> offers both scientists and laymen a highly readable introduction to the brilliant conceptions that helped unlock many secrets of energy and matter and laid the groundwork for future discoveries.</p><p></p></p><p><p><b>Modern Science Made Easy <br></b>By one of the leading physicists of the twentieth century, George Gamow's <i>One, Two, Three...Infinity</i> is one of the most memorable popular books on physics, mathematics, and science generally ever written, famous for having, directly or indirectly, launched the academic and/or scientific careers of many young people whose first real encounter with the wonders and mysteries of mathematics and science was through reading this book as a teenager. Untypically for popular science books, this one is enhanced by the author's own delightful sketches. Reviewers were enthusiastic when <i>One, Two, Three...Infinity</i> was published in 1947. </p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>In the Author's Own Words:<br></b>"If and when all the laws governing physical phenomena are finally discovered, and all the empirical constants occurring in these laws are finally expressed through the four independent basic constants, we will be able to say that physical science has reached its end, that no excitement is left in further explorations, and that all that remains to a physicist is either tedious work on minor details or the self-educational study and adoration of the magnificence of the completed system. At that stage physical science will enter from the epoch of Columbus and Magellan into the epoch of the <i>National Geographic Magazine</i>!" &#x2014; George Gamow </p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Critical Acclaim for <i>One, Two, Three...Infinity</i>:<br></b>"This skillful presentation is for the non-professional and professional scientist.

Although most of the currently popular handbooks have good ideas in them, they all suffer from the same problems: they're poorly organized; are composed mostly of quirky, idiosyncratic advice on how specific playwrights have gone about writing their own work; and are full of abstract theorizing on the nature of art. As a result, they fail to offer any concrete information on how to construct a well-written play or any useful guidelines and exercises. Moreover, few of these books are actually written by working playwrights. Out of frustration, Spencer wrote his own book. The result, <i>The Playwright's Guidebook</i>, is a clear, concise, and engaging handbook. Spencer addresses the important principles of structure, includes insightful writing exercises that build upon one another, explores the creative process, and troubleshoots recurrent problems that playwrights actually face.</p></p><p>Praise for THE PLAYWRIGHT'S GUIDEBOOK <p>"Stuart Spencer's *The Playwright's Guidebook* is indispensable. Clearly and thoroughly, Mr. Spencer--a playwright himself--leads all playwrights (not only the beginner) through the travails of creation and the jungle of production. He is to be congratulated."--Edward Albee </p><p>"Eureka! A clearly written, well-structured, intelligent how-to book about playwrighting. Like the good teacher and good writer that he is, Stuart Spencer guides rather than browbeats. Should be next to the laptop of any aspiring, or working, playwright."--Warren Leight, author of *Side Man* </p><p>"If you want to be a playwright, here's your bible." --David Lindsay-Abaire, author of *Fuddy Meers* and *Wonder of the World* </p><p>"Mr. Spencer's *Guidebook* is full of solid, straightforward advice in a conversational voice that takes the mystery out of how plays are wrought, not written." --Michael Weller, author of *Moonchildren*, *Loose Ends*, and Co-founder of the Mentor Project at the Cherry Lane Theatre </p><p>"A sensible, lucid, thorough and tremendously helpful journey into the always mysterious realities of playwriting." --Romulus Linney, author of *The Sorrows of Frederick*,*Holy Ghosts*, and *Tennessee* </p><p>"At last! A straight-from-the-shoulder approach to playwrighting that finally blows the dust off much of the mystique surrounding this craft. Stuart Spencer writes with wit, insight, clarity, brilliant first-hand knowledge, and yes, finally, offers genuine help! Refreshing and beautifully organized, this book is long overdue." --Jack O'Brien, Artistic Director, The Globe Theatres, San Diego </p><p>"Stuart Spencer's meticulous handbook does something I had thought was almost impossible: it describes, clarifies and analyzes the mysterious process of building a play. And moreover, he does so with the grace and respect of a first-rate teacher for the intelligence and potential of his students. There is no ideology, no formula for instant success here. Just the distilled experience of a real practitioner generous enough to share, and reliable enough to be trusted." --Jon Robin Baitz, author of *Ten Unknowns* and *Substance of Fire*</p><p><b>Stuart Spencer's</b> most recent play, <i>Resident Alien</i>, has been produced around the country and been optioned for film.

We are evolutionarily designed to fast, and the body knows how to do it very well. Fasting allows the body and all its systems to rest, purify, and heal. During a fast, the body enters the same cleansing and healing cycle it normally enters during sleep. As a fast progresses, the body consumes everything that is not essential to bodily functioning--including bacteria, viruses, fibroid tumors, waste products in the blood, buildup around the joints, and stored fat--and the mind and heart release their toxic buildup as well. As Stephen Harrod Buhner reveals, in order to be truly transformed, you must first empty yourself. <br> <br>Offering step-by-step guidelines to fully prepare yourself for a deep fast, Buhner explores what to expect during and after spiritual, emotional, and physical fasting and detoxification. He details the necessary dietary and mental preparations leading up to your fast, what you can and can&#x2019;t do during a fast, and how to end your fast. He also explains how to plan the length of your fast and how to choose between a water fast, a juice fast, or a mono-diet fast.

We are evolutionarily designed to fast, and the body knows how to do it very well. Fasting allows the body and all its systems to rest, purify, and heal. During a fast, the body enters the same cleansing and healing cycle it normally enters during sleep. As a fast progresses, the body consumes everything that is not essential to bodily functioning--including bacteria, viruses, fibroid tumors, waste products in the blood, buildup around the joints, and stored fat--and the mind and heart release their toxic buildup as well. As Stephen Harrod Buhner reveals, in order to be truly transformed, you must first empty yourself. <br> <br>Offering step-by-step guidelines to fully prepare yourself for a deep fast, Buhner explores what to expect during and after spiritual, emotional, and physical fasting and detoxification. He details the necessary dietary and mental preparations leading up to your fast, what you can and can&#x2019;t do during a fast, and how to end your fast. He also explains how to plan the length of your fast and how to choose between a water fast, a juice fast, or a mono-diet fast. Revealing how fasting can help or heal many chronic conditions, such as type II diabetes, childhood seizures, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, psoriasis, insomnia, and fibromyalgia, Buhner shows fasting as a way to truly inhabit the body, to experience its sacredness, and to activate its deep capabilities for self-healing. <br> <br>STEPHEN HARROD BUHNER lectures throughout the United States on herbal medicine, the sacredness of plants, and the intelligence of nature.

At its outset, the Bishop of Iceland dispatches a young emissary to investigate certain charges against the pastor at Sn?fells Glacier, who, among other things, appears to have given up burying the dead. But once he arrives, the emissary finds that this dereliction counts only as a mild eccentricity in a community that regards itself as the center of the world and where Creation itself is a work in progress.<br>What is the emissary to make, for example, of the boarded-up church? What about the mysterious building that has sprung up alongside it? Or the fact that Pastor Primus spends most of his time shoeing horses? Or that his wife, Ua (pronounced &#x201c;ooh-a,&#x201d; which is what men invariably sputter upon seeing her), is rumored never to have bathed, eaten, or slept? Piling improbability on top of improbability, <b>Under the Glacier</b><i> </i>overflows with comedy both wild and deadpan as it conjures a phantasmagoria as beguiling as it is profound.</p><p><b>Halld�r Laxness</b> was born near Reykjav�k, Iceland, in 1902. His first novel was published when he was seventeen. The undisputed master of contemporary Icelandic fiction, and one of the outstanding novelists of the century, he wrote more than sixty books, including novels, short stories, essays, poems, plays, and memoirs. In 1955 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Laxness died in 1998.<b>1<br>The Bishop Wants an Emissary</b><br><br>The bishop summoned the undersigned to his presence yesterday evening. He offered me snuff. Thanks all the same, but it makes me sneeze, I said. <br><br>Bishop: Good gracious! Well I never! In the old days all young theologians took snuff. <br><br>Undersigned: Oh, I'm not much of a theologian. Hardly more than in name, really. <br><br>Bishop: I can't offer you coffee, I'm afraid, because madam is not at home. Even bishops' wives don't stay home in the evenings any more: society's going to pieces nowadays. Well now, my boy, you seem to be a nice young fellow. I've had my eye on you since last year, when you wrote up the minutes of the synod for us. It was a masterpiece, the way you got all their drivel down, word for word. We've never had a theologian who knew shorthand before. And you also know how to handle that phonograph or whatever it's called. <br><br>Undersigned: We call it a tape recorder. Phonograph is better. <br><br>Bishop: All this gramophone business nowadays, heavens above! Can you also do television? That's even more fantastic! Just like the cinema-after two minutes I'm sound asleep. Where on earth did you learn all this stuff? <br><br>Undersigned: Oh, there's nothing much to making a tape recording, really. I got some practise as a casual worker in radio. But I've never done television. <br><br>Bishop: Never mind. Tape will do us. And shorthand. It's amazing how people can learn to scribble these rats'-tails! A bit like Arabic. It's about time you got ordained! But no doubt you've got a steady job? <br><br>Undersigned: I've done some tuition in languages. And a little in arithmetic. <br><br>Bishop: I see, good at languages too! <br><br>Undersigned: Well, I've got a smattering of those five or six languages you need for matriculation; and a little bit of Spanish because I took a group of tourists to Majorca once and did some preparation for that. <br><br>Bishop: And the theology, everything all right there, is that not so? <br><br>Undersigned: I suppose so. I'm not really much of a believer, though. <br><br>Bishop: A rationalist? That's not so good! One wants to watch that sort of thing. <br><br>Undersigned: I don't know what I should be called, really. Just an ordinary silly ass, I suppose. Nothing else. I didn't do too badly in theology, though. <br><br>Bishop: Perhaps not even wanting to be ordained? <br><br>Undersigned: Haven't thought much about it. <br><br>Bishop: You ought to think about it. And then you ought to get yourself a wife. That's how it went with me. It is also wholesome to have children. That's when you first begin to understand the workings of Creation. I need someone to go on a little journey for me. If it turns out well, you will be given a good living by and by. But a wife you'll have to sort out for yourself. <br><br>I began to listen expectantly now, but the bishop began to talk about French literature. French literature is so enjoyable, he said. Don't you think so? <br><br>Undersigned: Yes, I suppose so. If one had the time for it. <br><br>Bishop: Don't you find it odd that the greatest French writers should have written books about Iceland that made them immortal? Victor Hugo wrote <b>Han d'Islande</b>, Pierre Loti wrote <b>P�cheurs d'Islande</b>, and Jules Verne crowned it with that tremendous masterpiece about Sn�fellsj�kull (Sn�fells Glacier), <b>Voyage au Centre de la Terre</b>. That's where �rni Sakn�ssemm appears, the only alchemist and philosopher we've ever had in Iceland. No one can ever be the same after reading that book. Our people could never write a book like that-least of all about Sn�fellsj�kull. <br><br>The undersigned wasn't entirely in agreement with the bishop over the last book on the list, and declared that he himself was more impressed by that writer's account of Phileas Fogg's journey round the world than Otto Lidenbrock's descent down the crater on Sn�fellsj�kull. <br><br>It emerged, however, that what I thought about French literature was quite immaterial to the bishop. <br><br>Bishop: What do you say to putting your best foot forward and going to Sn�fellsj�kull to conduct the most important investigation at that world-famous mountain since the days of Jules Verne? I pay civil service rates. <br><br>Undersigned: Don't ask me to perform any heroic deeds. Besides, I've heard that heroic deeds are never performed on civil service rates. I'm not cut out for derring-do. But if I could deliver a letter for your Grace out at Glacier or something of that sort, that shouldn't be beyond my capacities. <br><br>Bishop: I want to send you on a three-day journey or so on my behalf. I'll be giving you a written brief for the mission. I'm going to ask you to call on the minister there, pastor J�n Pr�mus, for me, and tell him he is to put you up. There's something that needs investigating out there in the west. <br><br>Undersigned: What's to be investigated, if I may ask? <br><br>Bishop: We need to investigate Christianity at Glacier. <br><br>Undersigned: And how am I expected to do that-an inexperienced ignoramus like me? <br><br>Bishop: It would probably be best to begin by investigating old pastor J�n himself: for example, to establish whether the man's crazy or not, or is perhaps more brilliant than all the rest of us. He spent six years at a university in Germany trying to study history and eventually ended up as a theologian here with us. He was always a little equivocal. Some say he's lost his faith. <br><br>Undersigned: Am I to start meddling in that? <br><br>Bishop: What I want to know, because I happen to be the office boy at the Ministry of Ecclesiastical Affairs, is first of all why doesn't the man keep the church in good repair? And why doesn't he hold divine service? Why doesn't he baptise the children? Why doesn't he bury the dead? Why hasn't he drawn his stipend for ten or twenty years? Does that mean he's perhaps a better believer than the rest of us? And what does the congregation say? On three successive visitations I have instructed the old fellow to put these matters right. The office has written him all of fifty letters. And never a word in reply, of course. But you can't warn a man more than three times, let alone threaten him-the fourth time the threat just lulls him to sleep; after that there's nothing for it but summary defrocking. But where are the crimes? That's the whole point! An investigation is called for. There are some cock-and-bull stories going around just now that he has allowed a corpse to be deposited in the glacier. What corpse? It's an absolute scandal! Kindly check it! If it's a dead body, we want to lug it down to habitation and bury it in consecrated ground. And if it's something else, then what is it? The year before last I wrote to the chap who's supposed to be the parish clerk there, I've forgotten what his name is. The reply arrived yesterday, exactly eighteen months later; you can't say they're in a tearing hurry, these fellows! What sort of country bumpkins are they, may I ask? Is there some kind of mutual protection at Glacier? Against us here! Some sort of freemasonry! And this fellow's twice as crazy as pastor J�n Pr�mus has ever been. I think it wouldn't come amiss to examine him a little, too. Here's his bit of scribble. <br><br>The bishop handed me a dog-eared scrap of paper that could hardly have come through the post; it looked as if it had been carried from farm to farm and shuffled from pocket to pocket through many districts. Nonetheless, the letter evinced a mental attitude, if you could call it that, which has more to it than meets the eye and which expresses the logic of the place where it belongs but has little validity anywhere else, perhaps. The bishop rattled on while I ran my eye over the letter: And then he's said to have allowed anglers and foreigners to knock up some monstrosity of a building practically on top of the church-tell him from me to have it pulled down at once! Moreover, he really must get round to divorcing his wife. I've heard he's been married for more than thirty years, since long before I became bishop, and hasn't got round to divorcing his wife yet, even though it's a known fact that she has never shared bed nor board with him. Instead, he seems to have got mixed up with a woman they call Hnallp�ra, of all things! Is Christianity being tampered with, or what? <br><br>Letter to the bishop from the parish clerk, one Tumi J�nsen of Br�n-under-Glacier. Main contents: The writer begs indulgence for laziness with the pen, senile decay, etcetera, and is now at last getting down to answering the letter from the Bishop of Iceland, duly received the year before last, containing questions regarding Christian observance at Glacier. Likewise what truth there might be in rumours that the pastor is inadequate to his calling and that parish duties are being neglected; item, has there in recent years been any queer traffic with some unspecified casket on the glacier, and other goings-on of that nature? The parish clerk simply permits himself to place on record his unshakeable conviction that neither in this parish nor anywhere else around Glacier could anyone be found who would not acknowledge that the minister at Glacier, pastor J�n J�nsson, known as Pr�mus, is a man of gold. Not a living creature in this place would choose to be without pastor J�n for a single day. The whole community would be grief-stricken if a hair of his noble head were harmed. To be sure it is sometimes suggested that our pastor is not overhasty regarding his parish duties, but I venture to assert upon my conscience as parish clerk that everyone eventually gets buried with all due propriety and honour, just as in other places in the country. On the other hand, if any implement anywhere in these parts is in disrepair (because they no longer manufacture anything but rubbish here in Iceland or abroad nowadays), then you come to the crux of the matter where our pastor J�n is concerned: whatever it is that's damaged, be it utensils or machines, ladles or old knives, even broken earthenware pots, everything is resurrected as good as new or better than new at the hands of pastor J�n. I'm afraid that many a rider or motorist in these parts would think it a tragedy if pastor J�n were removed, such an excellent man to have near the main road, always ready to shoe a horse at any time of the day or night, a veritable artist at patching up people's worn-out engines so that everything goes again like new. In conclusion, it's quite true that our church is a little the worse for wear, although in fact there haven't been many complaints; but God is said to be great. No need to elaborate further on that. Your Grace's loving and obedient servant, Tumi J�nsen of Br�n-under-Glacier. <br><br><b>2 <br>Emissary of the Bishop: EmBi for Short <br></b><br>When the undersigned had eventually agreed to make the journey, the bishop said: The first thing is to have the will; the rest is technique. <br><br>The undersigned continued, for appearance's sake, to protest his youth and lack of authority to scrutinise a venerable old man's discharge of his pastoral duties or to reform Christianity in places where the words of even the bishop himself were disregarded; or what kind of "technique" could one expect from an ignorant youth in such a predicament? What am I to say? What am I to do? <br><br>Bishop: One should simply say and do as little as possible. Keep your eyes peeled. Talk about the weather. Ask what sort of summer they had last year, and the year before last. Say that the bishop has rheumatism. If any others have rheumatism, ask where it affects them. Don't try to put anything right-that's our business in the Ministry of Ecclesiastical Affairs, provided that we know what's wrong. We're asking for a report, that's all. No matter what credos or fables they come up with, you're not to try to convert them or try to reform anything or anyone. Let them talk; don't argue with them. And if they are silent, what are they silent about? Note down everything relevant-I'll give you the outline in the brief. Don't be personal-be dry! We don't want to hear anything funny from the west; we laugh at our own expense here in the south. Write in the third person as much as possible. Be academic, yes, but in moderation. Take a tip from the phonograph. <br><br>EmBi (hereinafter written Embi): If the pastor is always patching up old engines or mending saucepans and forgets to bury the dead so that corpses are taken up onto the glacier, well, can a farce be made less comical than it actually is? <br><br>Bishop: I'm asking for facts. The rest is my business. <br><br>Embi: Am I not even to say what I think about it, then? <br><br>Bishop: No no no, my dear chap. We don't care in the slightest what you think about it. We want to know what you see and hear, not how the situation strikes you. Do you imagine we're such babies here that people need to think for us and draw conclusions for us and put us on the potty? <br><br>Embi: But what if they start filling me up with lies? <br><br>Bishop: I'm paying for the tape. Just so long as they don't lie through you. One must take care not to start lying oneself! <br><br>Embi: But somehow I've got to verify what they say. <br><br>Bishop: No verifying! If people tell lies, that's as may be. If they've come up with some credo or other, so much the better! Don't forget that few people are likely to tell more than a small part of the truth: no one tells much of the truth, let alone the whole truth. Spoken words are facts in themselves, whether true or false. When people talk they reveal themselves, whether they're lying or telling the truth. <br><br>Embi: And if I find them out in a lie? <br><br>Bishop: Never speak ill of anyone in a report. Remember, any lie you are told, even deliberately, is often a more significant fact than a truth told in all sincerity. Don't correct them, and don't try to interpret them either. That's our responsibility. He who would hold his own against them, let him take care not to lose his own faith.</p><h2>Children&#39;s Books in Children&#39;s Hands: A Brief Introduction to Their Literature (What&#39;s New in Literacy)</h2><p><i> <b>Children&#x2019;s Books in Children&#x2019;s Hands: A Brief Introduction to Their Literature</b> </i> familiarizes current and future teachers with the best and most recent books for children.

Rather than a globe-trotting adventure, it takes place completely at Marlinspike Hall, where an incapacitated Captain Haddock is being nursed back to health by an unwelcome visitor in the form of Bianca Castafiore, the "Milanese Nightingale" who then suffers a devastating loss ("Mercy, my jewels!"). It's disfavored by some fans due to the lack of action, but the locked-room mystery, character interactions, running gags, and crazy Calculus inventions keep it fun and definitely worth reading. <p> <i>Flight 714</i>, Herge's second-to-last completed Tintin story, is a high adventure featuring a gallery of returning characters, though it's a new character, Laszlo Carreidas, "the millionaire who never laughs," who starts the trouble by inviting Tintin and his friends to skip their commercial flight to Sidney to accompany him on his private jet. That leads to a complicated ransom plot, and the action just gets more outlandish from there. Suspend disbelief, though, and <i>Flight 714</i> is one of Tintin's more thrilling rides. </p><p> Finished in 1976, <i>Tintin and the Picaros</i> was Herge's final completed Tintin adventure, and interestingly, he used it to return to a scene from 40 years earlier: The South American republic of San Theodoros, where Tintin met General Alcazar in <i>The Broken Ear</i>. Alcazar is again facing trouble from his rival, General Tapioca, and numerous other characters from the past weave themselves into the story. While <i>Tintin and the Picaros</i> is entertaining, Herge was slow to finish it, and his world-weariness is reflected in the attitudes of some of the characters. </p><p> The 3-in-1 format provides excellent value, but the small size (about 40% smaller than the single-story paperbacks) makes it harder to enjoy the detail in Herge's layouts. <i>--David Horiuchi</i></p>Herg�, one of the most famous Belgians in the world, was a comics writer and artist. The internationally successful Adventures of Tintin are his most well-known and beloved works. They have been translated into 38 different languages and have inspired such legends as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. He wrote and illustrated for The Adventures of Tintin until his death in 1983.</p><h2>Literacy in the Early Grades: A Successful Start for PreK-4 Readers and Writers</h2><p><b> A practical and balanced approach to helping young students become fluent readers and writers </b> <i> <b>Literacy in the Early Grades: A Successful Start for PreK-4 Readers and Writers </b> </i>presents a balanced approach to literacy instruction that will help all young students make a successful start in reading and writing.

Or she would be if she could get someone to hire her. Starting her own business has been more challenging than she thought it would be&#x2014;now that the Order is disparaging her good name. Plus, many potential clients are afraid of getting on the bad side of the Beast Lord, who just happens to be Kate&#x2019;s mate.<br> &nbsp;<br> So when Atlanta&#x2019;s premier Master of the Dead calls to ask for help with a vampire on the loose, Kate leaps at the chance of some paying work. But it turns out that this is not an isolated incident, and Kate needs to get to the bottom of it&#x2014;fast, or the city and everyone dear to her may pay the ultimate price...</p><p><b>Magic Slays: Happily Ever After... Not So Fast</b><br><br>Every one of us has read fairy tales.&nbsp; Most of them follow the same pattern: a hero or heroine face a great enemy and many challenges.&nbsp; They fight against overwhelming odds and eventually they prevail.&nbsp; They marry a prince or a princess and live Happily Ever After.&nbsp; No sequels - the story is complete and it's over the moment the hero kisses the princess against the backdrop of the setting sun.<br><br>It's a great narrative pattern and it endured through thousands of years.&nbsp; That's why MAGIC SLAYS is a kind of book most authors hope they will never have to write.&nbsp; It's the story that takes place after the sun has set and new collection of monsters besieges the happy couple's castle.<br><br> When you look at the rest of the series, the calm and sweet Happily Ever After doesn't really makes sense.&nbsp; Kate, who has been a loner all of her life and avoided responsibility for other people, suddenly finds herself responsible for hundreds of shapeshifters within the Pack.&nbsp; And when they say "responsible",&nbsp; they mean it: they expect her to manage their troubled offspring, they expect her to sit in judgment and sort out their squabbles, and when danger arises, they expect her to put herself between them and that danger.&nbsp; Stepping into the path of a threat for the sake of other people is nothing new to Kate.&nbsp; However, this time the enemy isn't a single individual, but many.&nbsp; They are well organized, ruthless and fanatic in pursuit of their goal.&nbsp; And they threaten not just one or two people but literally everyone Kate knows. How do you guard thousands of potential targets against an enemy who could strike anywhere at any time?<br><br> It doesn't help that she isn't universally loved within the Pack. Technically her position as the Beast Lord's mate comes with great power.&nbsp; Practically, she faces opposition.&nbsp; She loves Curran, but he isn't the easiest man to live with either.&nbsp; He is stubborn and overly protective, and mind-numbingly difficult when he wants to be.&nbsp; And just when she thinks she has things in hand, her past returns once again and threatens to shatter her from inside out.<br><br> On other hand, Curran, who never had to share power before, is faced with the reality: Kate is his mate and he must share.&nbsp; From the moment Mahon had found him, Mahon's intention had always been to hammer Curran into the ultimate alpha, a man who could subdue and keep control of the violent unpredictable leaders of the shapeshifter clans.&nbsp; Mahon succeeded.&nbsp; Curran is a skilled ruler: he manipulates, manages, rewards, encourages, and threatens the shapeshifters under his command to ensure peace within the Pack.<br><br> None of his methods work with Kate.&nbsp; She reacts badly to any attempt at manipulation.&nbsp; She refuses commands.&nbsp; And occasionally she laughs at him.&nbsp; So Curran must learn how to request rather than order, and that doesn't come naturally to the man who'd been an near absolute ruler for the better part of his life.<br><br> MAGIC SLAYS is a volatile book.&nbsp; It's a boiling pot of emotions and danger, tragedy and comedy, defeat and victory.&nbsp; It's a story of love and devotion above all else, but it's also a story of friendship and hate, where failure carries an ultimate price tag.&nbsp; We won't promise you a smooth sailing, but we ask you to trust us.&nbsp; When it comes to our books, that one, most important adage of fairy tales always stays true: we will bring our characters safely to port.<br><br> MAGIC SLAYS is a Happily Ever After in progress, wrought with danger, and perils, and some laughs.&nbsp; We hope you'll give it a try.&nbsp; Come fight the monsters with us.&nbsp; You won't regret it.New York Times Bestselling author Ilona Andrews is the pseudonym for a husband-and-wife writing team.

This engaging narrative slices through the cobwebs of time, memory, and prevailing cynicism to reinvigorate America with an informed patriotism.</p></p><p>Dr. William J. Bennett is one of America&#39;s most influential and respected voices on cultural, political, and educational issues. Host of &#34;The Bill Bennett Show&#34; podcast, he is also the Distinguished Fellow of the American Strategy Group. He is the author and editor of more than twenty-five books, and lives in North Carolina.The second volume of Bennett's overview of U.S. history begins with the events leading up to WWI, tracing the progress of the U.S. through the end of Reagan's presidency. Bennett (The Book of Virtues) has a long history of government service-he was Secretary of Education under Ronald Reagan and Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under George H.W. Bush-and the overall tone of the book reflects the deep respect he holds for America's leaders, history and institutions. Bennett is a leading figure in the neoconservative movement, so his interpretation of America's last 90 years is informed by that perspective. But while he wears both his patriotism and politics on his sleeve, Bennett avoids flag-waving or talk-radio-style generalizations. This is a breezy, heartfelt survey, written with the average reader in mind, that will appeal broadly to those looking for an America-friendly introduction to 20th century U.S. history. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Look down in the basement, up in the attic, under the floorboards, and even in the showerhead, and you'll find life everywhere. Biologist Rob Dunn and his team have done it in homes worldwide, and they found nearly 200,000 species! In <i>Never Home Alone</i>, Dunn introduces us to these tiny tenants and shows us how -- in almost every case -- they make our lives better, and explains why trying to eradicate the bad ones just makes our lives worse. No one who reads this engrossing, revelatory, and just plain fun book will look at their home, or the life in it, in the same way again.<b><br></b><b>A <i>New York Times Book Review</i>'s "Editor's Choice"</b><b> </b><b><br></b><b>"Excellent." --<i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><b><br></b><b>"You'll love Never Home Alone." --<i>Bustle</i></b><b><br></b><b>"Utterly fascinating." --<i>The Washington Post</i></b></p><p><b>Rob Dunn </b>is a professor in the Department of Applied Ecology at North Carolina State University and in the Natural History Museum of Denmark at the University of Copenhagen.

Each is developed and discussed in its own chapter, yet also differentiated from and compared to the other two theories. The authors identify each theory's starting point, its goals and foci, and its internal logic. They connect their comparative theory analysis to the larger policy issues that divide the rival camps of theorists around such central issues as the role government should play in the economy and the class structure of production, stressing the different analytical, policy, and social decisions that flow from each theory's conceptualization of economics.</p><p>The authors, building on their earlier book <i>Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical</i>, offer an expanded treatment of Keynesian economics and a comprehensive introduction to Marxian economics, including its class analysis of society. Beyond providing a systematic explanation of the logic and structure of standard neoclassical theory, they analyze recent extensions and developments of that theory around such topics as market imperfections, information economics, new theories of equilibrium, and behavioral economics, considering whether these advances represent new paradigms or merely adjustments to the standard theory. They also explain why economic reasoning has varied among these three approaches throughout the twentieth century, and why this variation continues today&#x2015;as neoclassical views give way to new Keynesian approaches in the wake of the economic collapse of 2008.</p></p><p><b>Richard D.

There is simply no other text that brings together the material assembled here. Throughout, the authors are sensitive to the causes and consequences of theoretical differences and demonstrate&#x2015;to teachers and students of economics, and to everyone else who wants to learn about economic debates in the world today&#x2015;that economic theories really do matter.</p>&#x2015;<b>David F.

By carefully describing neo-classical microeconomics and Keynesian macro-economics, and by juxtaposing both to Marxian economic theory, Richard Wolff and Stephen Resnick provide an essential guide for building a more just future.</p>&#x2015;<b>David Fasenfest</b>, Wayne State University; editor, Critical Sociology<br><br><p>Richard Wolff and Stephen Resnick treat their readers as adults who can, and in fact must, choose among theories, rather than as children who need to be spoon-fed the truth. Their clear and creative presentation of the different entry points, logics and conclusions of neoclassical, Keynesian and Marxian theories makes this by far the best comparative treatment of economics available today. Readers will have a grasp of the history of these theories as well as the latest developments in them, and will see how theories change in mutual interaction with changes in the economy.

"Or do you want to fight me instead? "<br> "None of us," a calm voice said behind Sharpe, "wants to fight Ensign Sharpe."<br></i> <br> Richard Sharpe.<br> <p> Soldier, hero, rogue�the man you always want on your side. Born in poverty, he joined the army to escape jail and climbed the ranks by sheer brutal courage. He knows no other family than the regiment of the 95th Rifles, whose green jacket he proudly wears. </p></p><p>Fighting in the millet fields of India circa 1803, Richard Sharpe knows trouble when he sees it: dissension in the ranks, a feverish and arrogant enemy, nobody to confide in. Unbeknownst to his comrades, Sharpe has buried a fortune in booty along the way. He knows his freedom is coming, and it's only a matter of time before he can feast on the spoils. <i>Sharpe's Fortress</i> is the 17th in Bernard Cornwell's series starring this colonial British soldier who has risen in the ranks despite blunders and misadventures, not to mention his own suspicions of the men around him.<p> Treason, near-death experiences, cannonballs hidden in the tall grass "sticky with blood and thick with flies, lying twenty paces from the man it had eviscerated," these are the elements of Cornwell's war stories, which rely heavily on long, involved--and involving--battle scenes, marvelous description, and bawdy dialogue in the trenches (a highlight: arguments over whether there's such a thing as breasts that look like grapes). For readers who hunger for humorous, complex characterizations, Sharpe proves vivid and three-dimensional. He holds tightly to his dreams of treasure, eavesdropping on betrayers, ultimately hatching a desperate plan to make his way to the fortress in the sky, Gawilghur. Cornwell's hero is an honest soldier, and also a pragmatic one. He doesn't care as much about the medals and the glory as he cares about dodging cannon fire and finding a place to sleep. <i>--Ellen Williams</i></p><p>BERNARD CORNWELL is the author of the acclaimed <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Saxon Tales series, which includes <em>The Last Kingdom, The Pale Horseman, Lords of the North, Sword Song, The Burning Land, Death of Kings, The Pagan Lord</em>, and, most recently, <em>The Empty Throne </em>and <em>Warriors of the Storm</em>, and which serves as the basis for the hit television series <em>The Last Kingdom</em>.

Now, thirty-five years since its publication, authors Penny Simpson and Lucy Kitto have refreshed their work, expanding and adding to the material, re-designing the pages, and re-drawing many of the delightful illustrations. The book has a cleaner, more modern look, yet retains the simple, friendly, and distinctively Japanese sensibility of the original. In addition to the new layout and drawings, the authors have tweaked the text and expanded several sections (including the discussion of underglazing and overglazing, and the Tea Ceremony and its utensils). There&#x2019;s also a new page showing different types of brushes; and the Information chapter has been updated to include websites and recent books.<br>The book is a manual to the way pots are made in Japan, their forms, and their decorations.The authors give a thorough account of both traditional and modern techniques and also describe in detail tools, materials, glazes, and the setup of workshops and kilns. Lucy Kiitto&#x2019;s sprightly drawings infuse each page with life and clarity. Pottery terms and expressions are listed with their Japanese equivalents, and the new edition keeps the bi-lingual text, making it easier for the exchange of ideas between foreign students studying in Japan and Japanese potters.</p><p><b>PENNY SIMPSON</b>&#x2019;s interest in making pots started when she was living in Japan in the 1970s. She studied pottery in Kyoto and explored many of the pottery-making areas of Japan before writing <i>The Japanese Pottery Handbook</i>, which Kodansha International published in 1979. Following her training at the renowned Dartington Pottery in the U.K., Simpson set up her own workshop in Devon, moving to her present location in Moretonhampstead in 1994. She enjoys cooking and making pots which enhance the pleasures of preparing and eating food. She also makes planters, tiles, and commissioned commemorative pieces. She sells her work from her own showroom and exhibits widely in the U.K. and abroad. LUCY KITTO learned to pot at a very young age at the Dartington Hall School under the tutelage of potter Bernard Forrester. In her early twenties, she travelled to Japan where she lived with Penny Simpson and attended the same pottery school. This was where they first saw the need for a book to support students studying ceramics in Japan. Since returning to England, <b>Kitto</b> has trained as a teacher, and is Art Coordinator at a school in Sheffield. KANJI SODEOKA was Penny Simpson&#x2019;s first pottery teacher and collaborated with her on the original edition of <i>The Japanese Pottery Handbook</i>.Text: English, Japanese</p><h2>Almost Human: The Astonishing Tale of Homo naledi and the Discovery That Changed Our Human Story</h2><p>This first-person narrative about an archaeological discovery is rewriting the story of human evolution. A story of defiance and determination by a controversial scientist, this is Lee Berger's own take on finding <i>Homo naledi</i>, an all-new species on the human family tree and one of the greatest discoveries of the 21st century. <br><br>In 2013, Berger, a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence, caught wind of a cache of bones in a hard-to-reach underground cave in South Africa. He put out a call around the world for petite collaborators&#x2014;men and women small and adventurous enough to be able to squeeze through 8-inch tunnels to reach a sunless cave 40 feet underground. With this team of "underground astronauts," Berger made the discovery of a lifetime: hundreds of prehistoric bones, including entire skeletons of at least 15 individuals, all perhaps two million years old. Their features combined those of known prehominids like Lucy, the famous <i>Australopithecus</i>, with those more human than anything ever before seen in prehistoric remains. Berger's team had discovered an all new species, and they called it <i>Homo naledi</i>.<br><br>The cave quickly proved to be the richest primitive hominid site ever discovered, full of implications that shake the very foundation of how we define what makes us human. Did this species come before, during, or after the emergence of <i>Homo sapiens</i> on our evolutionary tree? How did the cave come to contain nothing but the remains of these individuals? Did they bury their dead? If so, they must have had a level of self-knowledge, including an awareness of death. And yet those are the very characteristics used to define what makes us human. Did an equally advanced species inhabit Earth with us, or before us? Berger does not hesitate to address all these questions. <br><br>Berger is a charming and controversial figure, and some colleagues question his interpretation of this and other finds. But in these pages, this charismatic and visionary paleontologist counters their arguments and tells his personal story: a rich and readable narrative about science, exploration, and what it means to be human.</p><p>LEE R. BERGER is the Research Professor in Human Origins and the Public Understanding of Science at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, and a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence.

It was after a period in Saudi Arabia, which she found &#x2018;damaging physically and spiritually&#x2019; that Donna decided to move to Venice, where she has now lived for over twenty years.</p> <p>Her debut as a crime fiction writer began as a joke: talking in a dressing room in Venice&#x2019;s opera-house La Fenice after a performance, Donna and a singer friend were vilifying a particular German conductor. From the thought &#x2018;why don&#x2019;t we kill him?&#x2019; and discussion of when, where and how, the idea for <b>Death at La Fenice</b> took shape, and was completed over the next four months.</p> <p><b> Donna Leon is the crime reviewer for the London <b>Sunday Times</b>&nbsp;and is an opera expert.

Brigitte Fassbaender, one of the great mezzo-sopranos of our time, and now head of the Landestheater in Innsbruck, agreed to come out of retirement both to direct the opera and to play the part of the witch Azuneris (whose name combines the names of the two great Verdi villainesses Azucena and Amneris).</b></p>To solve the murder of a young American soldier, commissario of Venice police Guido Brunetti encounters investigational constraints that leave him awed and embittered.

Fields cautiously portrays the cast of characters, differentiating each one uniquely. We sense the sinister and innocent via her mediated expression, and appreciate the difficult case Guido Brunetti has undertaken. B.J.L.

Recounted in lurid detail by newspapers throughout the Western world, and covered sensationally by America&#x2019;s Hearst press, the pre-Easter attacks seized the imagination of an international public, quickly becoming the prototype for what would become known as a &#x201c;pogrom,&#x201d; and providing the impetus for efforts as varied as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and the NAACP. Using new evidence culled from Russia, Israel, and Europe, distinguished historian Steven J. Zipperstein&#x2019;s wide-ranging book brings historical insight and clarity to a much-misunderstood event that would do so much to transform twentieth-century Jewish life and beyond. 40 illustrations</p><p>Steven J. Zipperstein is the Daniel E. Koshland Professor in Jewish Culture and History at Stanford University. A contributor to the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Jewish Review of Books and coeditor of the &#x201c;Jewish Lives&#x201d; series for Yale University Press, he lives in Berkeley, California.&#x201c;Impressive, heart wrenching.... The genocide of World War II has come to act like a screen across the middle of the 20th century. But Zipperstein reminds us that it is important to understand the catastrophes that preceded. And there&#x2019;s no better place to start than Kishinev.... [A] masterly work.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Anthony Julius, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The story of the Kishinev pogrom is a useful reminder that fake news, conspiracy theories, and rumor-mongering did not begin with the rise of Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. Indeed, the era of the pogrom was, as the distinguished historian of Russian Jewry Steven Zipperstein emphasizes, in some ways where all this began.... a wide-ranging survey by a major historian of one of the defining events of modern Jewish history.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Mark Mazower, <i>Jewish Review of Books</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Pogrom</em> is a splendid book that pinpoints the moment at the start of the twentieth century when exile in Europe turned deadly in a way that foretold the end of everything. It tells us the horror that occurred street by street, butchery by butchery&#x2015;with gripping clarity and an admirable brevity.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Philip Roth</strong><br><br>&#x201c;The methodical slaughter of forty-nine Jews on the streets of Kishinev, the capital of Moldova, over the course of three days in April, 1903, was a pivotal event in the history of modern anti-Semitism, the rise of Zionism, and, as a symbol of racist violence, a catalyst for the rise of the N.A.A.C.P. With extraordinary scholarly energy, Zipperstein uncovers sources in Russian, Yiddish, and English that show not only why this bloody event ignited the Jewish imagination, its sense of embattlement in exile, but also why it had such lasting resonance internationally.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The New Yorker</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The best single volume treatment of a seminal but under-discussed event in modern history that I&#x2019;ve read.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jeffrey Goldberg, <i>Radio Atlantic</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Riveting.... Zipperstein&#x2019;s excellent narrative vividly illustrates how the Kishinev pogrom would &#x2018;so chisel itself into contemporary Jewish history and beyond that it held meaning even for those who never heard of the town.&#x2019; And why the lessons that &#x2018;spilled from the pogrom&#x2019;s rubble&#x2019; still resonate today.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Elaine Elinson, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Subtle, elegant, and masterful. [Zipperstein] has turned the writing of the Kishinev story and its varied reception into a prism whose spectrum illuminates an astonishing range of subjects within a geographical triangle whose corners are Imperial Russia, the United States, and Israel. Wherever the light falls within that great triangle, Zipperstein &#x2015; drawing on his exceptionally broad preparation &#x2015; brings something new and unexpected into view.... [A] historical masterpiece.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jack Miles, <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Steven Zipperstein&#x2019;s new book, <em>Pogrom: Kishinev and the Tilt of History</em>, is uncannily timely: today in particular we might appreciate the irony of fate that American anti-racism can trace one line of origin to a backwoods region of the Russian Empire.... In his writing, Zipperstein adopts a Chekhovian sparseness. He willfully resists the temptation towards pathos.... Zipperstein wants to return to the grounding of empiricism and build interpretation from there, aware that meanings have already grown from fictions and can never be un-meant.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Marci Shore, <i>Public Seminar</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Outstanding.... Zipperstein brilliantly, and consequentially, traces the shift in anti-Semitic ideology from one based mainly in religious difference to one based in economics and cultural conflict.... But the book&#x2019;s most profound impact might well be how we view anti-Semitic movements and their close progeny -- other racist or extreme nativist movements -- today. Kishinev, in its links to a hatred of Jews that was really disguised fear and hatred of downward mobility and lost status, and the consequent development of conspiratorial and hateful extreme group-oriented ideologies to cast blame for this lost privilege, was one of the first of its kind. Tragically, it was not the last. And it raises a question for the future: widespread democracy and the rule of law were supposed to protect us from such things. Will they?&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jim Kaplan, <i>National Review</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This book, a model of the historian&#x2019;s craft, demonstrates how a single event in a provincial town can shape the imagination of a century. Structural grace and clear prose allow a lifetime of historical meditation and a decade of multilingual research to reach virtually any reader interested in Jewish, Russian, and, indeed, American history.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Timothy Snyder</strong></p><h2>Little City by the Lake (Little House Prequel)</h2><p><p><b></b></p><b>Spirit of the Western Frontier</b><p></p><p>Fifteen-year-old Caroline is leaving her Concord home for the first time to live with her aunt and uncle in Milwaukee, where she will attend Milwaukee Female College.

Some were bracing hopelessly for war against the ancient evil of Sauron. Some were contending with the treachery of the wizard Saruman.

Every Scripture and every myth is defined with a clarity that defies misunderstanding. And perhaps even more important, this dictionary treats the definitions of the Scriptures according to the intentions of the original writers. No other book discusses religious concepts as literature as broadly and as completely. And for each term the Dictionary includes: clear explanations of the symbolism of ancient and modern religious words and phrases; numerous quotations from authoritative sources; thoughtful descriptions of the meaning of the terms and how they are used in myths and Scriptures; and a complete cross reference. This comprehensive book gives lucid and penetrating analyses of all the important terms in the Sacred Language. You will also discover which symbols have double meaning and what they are, and how symbols vary from religion to religion, from country to country. The discovery of a metaphorical language underlying all sacred Scriptures prompted G A Gaskell to compile this dictionary, which gives a more complete knowledge of man&#x2019;s inner nature and the purpose of his life on earth than was ever before possible. The light this book sheds on the sacred writings and their relationship to mythology will be of great help to clergy and laymen, teachers and students of comparative religion, as well as to anyone who wishes to attain a better understanding of the foundations of the various religions of the world.

She shows us the gradual disintegration of her family due to their keeping the guilty secret of the father's affliction. The facade of normal family life was initially supported by Somers's stoic, churchgoing mother, but it also became the burden of the children. Though Somers's childhood in San Francisco was made harrowing by the rampages of her alcohol-maddened father, there were interstices of family togetherness. The author had a stormy adolescence, including a short-lived first marriage that produced a son; her siblings were affected by their own alcoholism until one, then another, joined Alcoholics Anonymous. Today, writes Somers, "Everyone in my family is now recovering." Her courageous outspokenness will support other children of alcoholics.

It&#x2019;s the story of two obsessions: McNamara&#x2019;s obsession with the criminal, and whatever abhorrent obsession drove him to commit a series of horrific rapes and murders over ten years. The author, a true crime journalist who created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com, describes the crimes and examines clues in an effort to uncover his identity. Occasionally, she challenges convention by inserting herself into the narrative (at one point, she even writes directly to the Golden State Killer), and the book acquires even more personal weight when one takes into account the fact that McNamara, at the age of 46, died while writing it. Knowing all of this, and with each chilling description, McNamara&#x2019;s obsession begins to become our own. She believed that the Golden State Killer would still be alive today. You will discover yourself hoping she&#x2019;s right, so that you can see him captured and brought to justice. <em>-- Chris Schluep, the Amazon Book Review</em></p><p>You&#x2019;ll be silent forever, and I&#x2019;ll be gone in the dark.</p><p>Over the course of more than ten years, a mysterious and violent predator committed fifty sexual assaults in Northern California before moving south, where he perpetrated ten sadistic murders.

The result is an explosive book that takes us, for the first time, deep inside a shadowy, fascinating, and surreal world of unscrupulous doctors, anything-goes team directors, and athletes so relentlessly driven to succeed that they would do anything&#x2014;and take any risk, physical, mental, or moral&#x2014;to gain the edge they need to win.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tyler Hamilton was once one of the world&#x2019;s best-liked and top-ranked cyclists&#x2014;a fierce competitor renowned among his peers for his uncanny endurance and epic tolerance for pain. In the 2003 Tour de France, he finished fourth despite breaking his collarbone in the early stages&#x2014;and grinding eleven of his teeth down to the nerves along the way. He started his career with the U.S. Postal Service team in the 1990s and quickly rose to become Lance Armstrong&#x2019;s most trusted lieutenant, and a member of his inner circle. For the first three of Armstrong&#x2019;s record seven Tour de France victories, Hamilton was by Armstrong&#x2019;s side, clearing his way. But just weeks after Hamilton reached his own personal pinnacle&#x2014;winning the gold medal at the 2004 Olympics&#x2014;his career came to a sudden, ignominious end: He was found guilty of doping and exiled from the sport.<br> &nbsp;<br> From the exhilaration of his early, na�ve days in the peloton, Hamilton chronicles his ascent to the uppermost reaches of this unforgiving sport. In the mid-1990s, the advent of a powerful new blood-boosting drug called EPO reshaped the world of cycling, and a relentless, win-at-any-cost ethos took root. Its psychological toll would drive many of the sport&#x2019;s top performers to substance abuse, depression, even suicide. For the first time ever, Hamilton recounts his own battle with clinical depression, speaks frankly about the agonizing choices that go along with the decision to compete at a world-class level, and tells the story of his complicated relationship with Lance Armstrong.<br> &nbsp;<br> A journey into the heart of a never-before-seen world, <i>The Secret Race</i> is a riveting, courageous act of witness from a man who is as determined to reveal the hard truth about his sport as he once was to win the Tour de France.</p><p><b>Tyler Hamilton</b> is a former professional bike racer, Olympic gold medalist, and NCAA champion. He raced professionally from 1995 to 2008 and now runs his own company, Tyler Hamilton Training LLC, in Boulder, Colorado. He lives in Missoula, Montana, with his wife, Lindsay, and his dog, Tanker.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Daniel Coyle</b> is the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling<i> </i>author of <i>Lance Armstrong&#x2019;s War</i> and <i>The Talent Code</i>. He lives with his wife and four children in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and Homer, Alaska.As a bike racer, over time you develop the skill of keeping a poker face. No matter how extreme a sensation you feel&#x2014;no matter how close you are to cracking&#x2014;you do everything in your power to mask it. This matters in racing, when hiding your true condition from your opponents is a key to success, since it discourages them from attacking. Feel paralyzing pain? Look relaxed, even bored. Can&#x2019;t breathe? Close your mouth. About to die? Smile.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve got a pretty good poker face; Lance has a great one. But there&#x2019;s one guy who&#x2019;s better than either of us: Johan Bruyneel. And it was never so well used as that night at the end of the 2000 Dauphin�, when he told me about the plans for the blood transfusion. I&#x2019;d heard about transfusions before, but it was always theoretical and distant&#x2014;as in, can you believe that some guys actually bank their blood, then put it back in before a race? It seemed weird, Frankenstein- ish, something for Iron Curtain Olympic androids in the eighties. But Johan, when he explained the plan during the Dauphin�, made it sound normal, even boring. He&#x2019;s good at making the outrageous sound normal&#x2014;it might be his greatest skill. It&#x2019;s something in his expression, in the certainty of his big Belgian voice, in the supremely casual way he shrugs while laying out the details of the plan. Whenever I watch the likable gangsters on <i>The Sopranos, </i>I think of Johan.<br> <br>As Johan explained it, Lance, Kevin, and I would fly to Valencia. We would donate a bag of blood, which would be stored, and we&#x2019;d fl y home the next day. Then, at a key point during the Tour, we&#x2019;d put the bag back in, and we&#x2019;d get a boost. It would be like taking EPO, except better: there were rumors of an EPO test being developed for the 2000 Olympics, and word was, they might be using the test during the Tour. I listened to Johan, nodded, gave him my poker face. When I told Haven about it, she gave me the poker face right back (wives get good at it, too). But part of me was thinking, <i>What the hell?</i><br> <br>Maybe that&#x2019;s why I was late the Tuesday morning we left for Valencia. There was no reason to be late&#x2014;everybody knew Lance despised lateness above all things&#x2014;but on that crucial morning we were running late by a full ten minutes. I raced our little Fiat through the narrow streets of Villefranche; Haven was hanging on to the oh-shit bars, asking me to slow down. I kept speeding up. It was eight miles to the airport in Nice. During the trip, my cell phone rang three times. Lance.<br> <i><br>Dude, where are you?</i><br> <i>What&#x2019;s going on? We&#x2019;re about to take off.</i><br> <i>How fast can that fucking car of yours go? Come on!</i><br> <br>We screeched into the airport parking lot; I walked through the security area and onto the runway. I&#x2019;d never been on a private jet before, so I took in the scene: the leather seats, the television, the little fridge, the steward asking me if I would like anything to drink.<br> <br>Lance acted casual, as if private jets were routine&#x2014;which for him, they were. He&#x2019;d been riding them fairly constantly since the previous July, courtesy of Nike, Oakley, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and the other corporations who were competing for the privilege of ferrying him around. The numbers were unbelievable. <i>USA Today </i>estimated Lance&#x2019;s income at $7.5 million, he was getting paid $100,000 per speech, and his new memoir, <i>It&#x2019;s Not About the Bike</i>, was an instant best seller. You could feel the flow of money, the new possibilities it opened. Now we didn&#x2019;t have to drive to Valencia. We didn&#x2019;t have to worry about customs or airport security. The jet, like everything else, was now part of our tool box.<br> <br>The engines revved, the wheels went up, and we were airborne. Below, we could see the C�te d&#x2019;Azur, the mansions, the yachts; it felt surreal, like a fantasy world. In the plane, my lateness was forgiven. Lance was confident, happy, excited, and it was contagious. The confident feeling increased when we landed in Valencia and were met on the runway by the Postal team: Johan, Pepe Mart�, and del Moral. They showed up with sandwiches, <i>bocadillos</i>&#x2014;it was important to have a little something in our stomachs beforehand.<br> <br>From the airport, we drove south for half an hour through a marshland as Johan and del Moral talked about the transfusion. It would be so simple, they said. So easy. Extremely safe, nothing at all to worry about. I noticed Johan talked more to Kevin and me than to Lance, and that Lance didn&#x2019;t seem to pay attention; I got the feeling this wasn&#x2019;t Lance&#x2019;s first transfusion.<br> <br>We pulled up near the village of Les Gavines at a beached whale of a hotel called the Sidi Saler, luxurious and quiet, free of the tourists who&#x2019;d be arriving later in summer. We&#x2019;d already been checked in; we took the elevator up to the fifth floor, moving through the deserted hallways. Kevin and I were directed into one room facing the parking lot; Lance got his own room next door.<br> <br>I had expected to see a sophisticated medical setup, but this looked more like a junior- high science experiment: a blue soft- sided cooler, a few clear plastic IV bags, cotton balls, some clear tubing, and a sleek digital scale. Del Moral took over.<br> <i><br>Lie on the bed, roll up your sleeve, give me your arm. Relax.</i><br> <br>He tied a blue elastic band below my biceps, set an empty transfusion bag on a white towel on the floor next to the bed, and wiped the inside of my elbow with an alcohol swab. Then the needle. I&#x2019;d seen a lot of needles, but this one was huge&#x2014;about the size and shape of a coffee stirrer. It was attached to a syringe that was in turn attached to clear tubing that led to the waiting bag, with a small white thumb wheel to control flow. I looked away; felt the needle go in. When I looked again, my blood was pumping steadily into the bag on the floor.<br> <br>You often hear &#x201c;blood transfusion&#x201d; tossed around in the same breath as &#x201c;EPO&#x201d; or &#x201c;testosterone,&#x201d; as if it&#x2019;s all equivalent. Well, it&#x2019;s not. With the other stuff, you swallow a pill or put on a patch or get a tiny injection. But here you&#x2019;re watching a big clear plastic bag slowly fill up with your warm dark red blood. You never forget it.<br> <br>I looked over to see Kevin hooked up in the same way. We could see our reflections on the closet-door mirror. We tried to cut the tension by comparing the speed with which our respective bags were filling: <i>Why are you going so slow? I&#x2019;m dropping you, dude. </i>Johan shuttled between the rooms, checking on us, making small talk.<br> <br>Every so often Pepe or del Moral would kneel down and take the bag in their hands, tilting it gently back and forth, mixing it with anticoagulant. They were gentle because, as they explained, the red blood cells were alive. If the blood was mishandled&#x2014; shaken or heated, or left in a refrigerator beyond four weeks or so&#x2014;the cells would die.<br> <br>Filling the bags took about fifteen or twenty minutes. The bags plumped up until the scale showed we were done: one pint, 500 milliliters. Then, unhook: needle out. Cotton ball, pressure. Bags taped closed, labeled, and tucked into the blue cooler. Del Moral and Pepe headed out; they didn&#x2019;t say where, but we guessed it was to the clinic in Valencia and the refrigerator there, where the bags would be stored until we needed them three weeks later at the Tour. <br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Goddesses Never Age: The Secret Prescription for Radiance, Vitality, and Well-Being</h2><p>Though we talk about wanting to "age gracefully," the truth is that when it comes to getting older, we&#x2019;re programmed to dread an inevitable decline: in our health, our looks, our sexual relationships, even the pleasure we take in living life.

Like others in the French Resistance, winemakers mobilized to oppose their occupiers, but the tale of their extraordinary efforts has remained largely unknown&#x2014;until now. <b>Wine and War</b> tells the alternately thrilling and harrowing story of the French wine producers who undertook ingenious, daring measures to save their cherished crops and bottles as the Germans closed in on them.<br><br>By rooting the narrative in the stories of five prominent winemaking families from France's key wine-producing regions of Burgundy, Alsace, the Loire Valley, Bordeaux, and Champagne, journalists Don and Petie Kladstrup vividly illustrate how men and women risked their lives for a cause that meant saving the heart and soul of France as much as protecting its economy. It was a extraordinary partnership involving everyone from the owners of Paris's famed restaurant La Tour d'Argent who rushed to build a wall to conceal their most precious twenty thousand bottles, to French soldiers who triumphantly reclaimed Hitler's enormous cache of stolen wines at the conclusion of the war.<br><br><b>Wine and War</b> portrays the central role wine has long played in France&#x2019;s military campaigns&#x2014;how Napoleon ordered wagon loads of champagne to sustain the morale of his armies and how, during World War I, huge quantites of wine were shipped to soldiers in the trenches of Northern France. By the beginning of World War II, wine represented a living for nearly 20 percent of France's population and the authors chronicle the Nazis' determination to seize control of the French wine industry and its profits. At the same time, <b>Wine and War</b><i> </i>brings to light the resourcefulness of wine producers who employed spiderwebs to "age" false walls hiding their best wines, who foisted off their worst bottles on the Germans or gleefully misdirected shipments, sending champagne to Homburg instead of Hamburg, and who sabotaged trains transporting wine to Germany. It also recounts the heroics of winemakers who hid Jewish refugees and smuggled members of the Resistance across the Demarcation Line in wine barrels, as well as the villainy of collaborators who worked with Nazi occupiers for their own benefit.<br><br>Finally, <b>Wine and War</b> reveals that the French were not alone in trying to save their wine. They received help from unexpected quarters: the German weinfuhrers<i>, </i>the very men the Nazis sent to requisition wine, whose close ties to the French wine industry mitigated their actions, and even the collaborationist Vichy regime, which recognized the importance of keeping France's vineyards French, and prevented the Nazis from seizing the Jewish-owned Chateaux Mouton-Rothschild and Lafite-Rothschild.<br><br>Based on three years of research and interviews with the survivors who engaged in this epic enterprise, <b>Wine and War </b>illuminates a compelling, little-known chapter of history, and stands as a tribute to extraordinary individuals who waged a battle that, in a very real way, saved the spirit of France.</p><p>Liberty, equality, and fraternity are all well and good, a champion of French culture once remarked. But, he continued, what made France truly superior to its neighbors was the French passion for wine, which "contributed to the French race by giving it wit, gaiety, and good taste, qualities which set it profoundly apart from people who drink a lot of beer."<p> The commentator may have had a point; after all, write Don and Petie Kladstrup, it was a well-known fact that Adolf Hitler did not like wine. Still, their leader's teetotalism notwithstanding, the Germans showed no distaste for French wine when they invaded France in 1940. Indeed, among the first acts of the occupying army was to seize great stores of wine, sending tens of thousands of barrels to the Third Reich and ordering the conversion of thousands of hectares of vineyards into war production.</p><p> Some French vintners, the Kladstrups write in this enjoyable study, went along with orders. Many others, however, including the heads of distinguished houses like Mo�t et Chandon, engaged in daring and dangerous acts of resistance wherever they could. Some lied about their yields; others built false walls to hide precious vintages; and still others concocted elaborate ruses, such as sprinkling carpet dust into inferior grades of new wine to give it a musty, distinguished flavor. Not every German was fooled, and some partisans of the grape died for their troubles. But some Germans, at considerable risk to themselves, also looked the other way. The Kladstrups fill their pages with memories of the wine war from both sides of the struggle, stories sometimes somber, sometimes amusing, that commemorate those "whose love of the grape and devotion to a way of life helped them survive and triumph over one of the darkest and most difficult chapters in French history." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>The winner of three Emmys and the Alfred I.

For her new PBS series, Child invited 26 chefs into her own kitchen in her Cambridge home to show their stuff while she cooked with them and asked questions. Although this is the companion volume to the series, it stands on its own as a collaboration between some of our best chefs and our longtime favorite chef of all. Child's guests include not only talented restaurant chefs but also such luminaries as cookbook author and authority Carol Field (The Italian Baker, LJ 11/15/85). Menus are quite complicated, with Child often emphasizing that a particular dish is for those who "love to cook," but she and her staff have made the recipes accessible to home cooks. There are ahead-of-time notes, suggestions for less-complicated substitutions, and lots of boxes on techniques and ingredients. Throughout it all, Child's inimitable voice and indomitable enthusiasm comes through, whether she is describing how to make a particularly complicated dish-"rapidly prepare the following, juggling pans and spoons and cooking everything all at once"-or explaining an unusual technique for pastry dough that fascinated her.

If C-2 were to close her eyes, she doubts she would remember what is inside the blank oval a second later.<br><br> If C-2 had to wager a guess as to the teenager&#x2019;s crime, she would bet shoplifting, or selling her grandmother&#x2019;s Percocets to her class�mates, or both. A one- or two-day trial at most. <br><br> The judge asks, &#x201c;Do any of you recognize the defendant?&#x201d; <br><br> Two hands shoot up. <br><br> &#x201c;I saw her on TV,&#x201d; says one of the flip-flop set. <br><br> &#x201c;On Court TV,&#x201d; says the woman who has removed her lip and nose rings out of respect for court. <br><br> The defendant&#x2019;s counsel, a full-figured woman in her early thir�ties, and the jury consultant, a gray-haired gentleman in Armani, confer: the two women are dismissed. Two more potential jurors enter the court and take the vacated chairs: a woman who looks pregnant but is too old to be pregnant, and the young man with whom C-2 had been mildly flirting in the holding area&#x2014;in his early forties, whereas C-2 is fifty-two&#x2014;the one who had all the clever answers on how to get out of jury duty. He catches her attention and shrugs self-mockingly. His eyes are a blue that seems too crys�talline to belong to his face, which is pitted with acne scars. Other than the church lady, he is the only one dressed appropriately for court; khakis, white shirt, closed shoes. C-2 is wearing cutoffs and a T-shirt. It is 95 degrees outside.<br><br> &#x201c;This is a murder trial,&#x201d; the judge says.<br><br> The defendant slides her eyes sideways in her expressionless face. C-2 follows the stare. It lands on a middle-aged woman seated in the front row of the gallery, her face an illustration of anguish. A blond replica of the defendant comforts the woman, but this version is prettier. Her face is vibrant, as if each feature were an individual puppet and she were the puppet master. If C-2 closed her eyes, she would remember that face.<br><br> &#x201c;The trial may take up to three weeks,&#x201d; the judge explains, &#x201c;and may involve sequestration. Is there anyone who believes themselves incapable of fulfilling such an obligation?&#x201d;<br><br> C-2&#x2019;s standby excuse, that she couldn&#x2019;t sit under &#x201c;In God We Trust,&#x201d; seems flippant, almost reprehensible to use given that the middle-aged woman is shuddering and imploding in the gallery. C-2 could tell the judge that her husband is eighty-six, the truth, and that she is his sole caretaker, her fear.<br><br> The woman too old to be pregnant and the man with the lucent blue eyes raise their hands.<br><br> &#x201c;F-17,&#x201d; the man introduces himself to the judge. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a professor at the medical school. My Gross Anatomy course begins next week. I have twenty-one cadavers waiting for me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t they already dead?&#x201d; the judge asks.<br><br> Again that self-mocking shrug. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he says.<br><br> &#x201c;They can wait.&#x201d;<br><br> The woman&#x2019;s hand is still up. &#x201c;J-12. I&#x2019;m going in for tests next week,&#x201d; she says. <br><br> The judge waits a beat for anyone else to speak up. <br><br> C-2 could still raise her hand. Though her husband retains his impressive, curious mind, he loses things daily&#x2014;keys, words, height, mass, the ability to hear conversations, his peripheral vision (though he insists on still driving), the subtlety of taste, and the assault of smell. And most alarming, the loss of the sixth sense, proprioception, the ability to know the position of one&#x2019;s body parts. Her husband isn&#x2019;t always sure where his hands and feet are without having to look for them. It takes him a wooden moment to reach for things, to make those measurements one unconsciously calculates each time one dips under a low beam, or eats popcorn in the dark. He can still navigate the day&#x2019;s obstacles, but for how much longer? C-2 is becoming his copilot. Her senses must work double-time shepherding two separate bodies through space, but to refuse the job&#x2014;not to point out the broken step, not to repeat the punch line he couldn&#x2019;t hear&#x2014;will mean abandoning him in the woolly, dim, mute isolation of old age. <br><br> She met her husband when she was twenty-four and he was fifty-seven. He was a Pulitzer-winning journalist and she had just given up portraiture for something more dangerous. He had asked her to be his photographer on an assignment in El Salvador&#x2014;civil war had broken out yet again. He had flown first-class, and she had flown economy. Not once during the seven-hour flight did he venture back into steerage to see how she was faring. That had cinched it for her: her attraction for him was an unreciprocated crush; he had only been interested in her photography.<br><br> At the San Salvador airport, they hitched a prearranged ride in a bus chartered by Hollywood&#x2019;s radical chic, a director of conspiracy thrillers, an earnest actress, and her producer husband. The actress had come to interview the charming mustachioed general of the rebels. The van had to cross the mountains before nightfall and curfew. The road was a stretch of graveled ascent, bracketed with makeshift checkpoints manned by ragged boys with rifles.<br><br> The producer broke out a bottle of Valium and handed the pills around. C-2 noted that the war correspondent didn&#x2019;t take one, so she didn&#x2019;t either, even though she wanted one very badly.<br><br> She could tell she had passed some sort of test with him, and that having passed the test, the power had shifted between them. That night at the hotel, she was aware of him staring at her as she opened her door. The stare was electric. She had only recently accepted that her desire had less to do with whom she was attracted to, and everything to do with whom she wanted to attract.<br><br> She played her hand riskily, bet the house. She walked into his room while he was transcribing his notes, unbuttoned her blouse. He took over from there, for which she was thankful.<br><br> She didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;doesn&#x2019;t&#x2014;consider herself especially attractive. She makes a handsome first impression&#x2014;a fit figure, a wedge of auburn hair, a long neck&#x2014;but on second look, her left eyelid droops slightly, and the asymmetry cancels out her best feature, her wild eyebrows, which she grooms weekly. Just before she met her husband, the lid miraculously found its way open, lending her face an astonished look, and, unbeknownst to her, she became extremely beautiful. The lid sank again a year later, but by then she had already met her husband. More important, she had been given a tease of the charmed life she might have lived had her left eyelid been two millimeters higher.<br><br> The first time her husband introduced her to his mother, eighty-seven years old and living in a Jewish retirement home in Buffalo, the old woman took one glance at C-2, at the apex of her beauty, then looked at her middle-aged son and asked a question that C-2, at twenty-four, hadn&#x2019;t yet thought to ask herself: Who is going to take care of him in his old age?<br><br> If C-2 is sequestered, she will only have to take care of herself&#x2014;a much-needed respite justified by civic duty. If something should happen&#x2014;the dreaded fall&#x2014;there is always the alternate to take her place. <br><br> The judge is still waiting. <br><br> C-2 doesn&#x2019;t raise her hand.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br><br> The jury box is now full, five women including C-2, and two men, F-17 and the twitchy alternate with the hectic buzz cut who doesn&#x2019;t pay attention when the judge explains what a <i>voir dire </i>is. The alter�nate is too busy admiring the defense counsel, the woman in her early thirties with the disruptively full figure. C-2 notes a shimmer when the young woman crosses her legs under the table. She is wear�ing nylons in August in Central Florida. <br><br> To C-2&#x2019;s left, the woman in her mid-sixties who had identified herself as a homemaker and member of the First Calvary Baptist congregation raises her hand. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s our other half?&#x201d; she asks the judge. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t there supposed to be twelve of us?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Florida only requires a six-person jury in all but capital cases,&#x201d; the judge explains. <br><br> The prosecutor, rotund, places both hands flat on the table and jacks himself up. He struggles to button his suit, gives up, and then flashes the jury an aw-shucks grin to let them know he is a local boy, not someone hired from South Florida. He rifles through the questionnaires the jury had filled out earlier that day, with all their stats&#x2014;profession, married or single, children, felonies&#x2014;and asks if anyone has concerns about being able to wait until they&#x2019;ve heard all the evidence before making up their minds. <br><br> C-2 has never had the patience to listen to someone else&#x2019;s story and not try to guess the ending. But guessing the ending is different than calcifying into certitude. She would be willing to switch sides if persuaded, but that wouldn&#x2019;t stop her from speculating. Who honestly imagines themselves to be that neutral and fair?<br><br> She glances around at the other potential jurors. They are all nodding affirmatively, certain of their neutrality and fairness, except F-17.<br><br> He raises his hand. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t the belief that you won&#x2019;t rush to judg�ment proof that you will?&#x201d; he says.<br><br> C-2 can see that he hopes his syllogism will get him dismissed.<br><br> But the prosecutor looks away, as if a new idea has just occurred to him. &#x201c;Do you read the newspaper?&#x201d; he asks the woman seated directly in front of C-2. The chairs in the back row sit on a riser. C-2 can see the woman&#x2019;s scalp through her cornrows. The woman is white and the stalks blond. The ruts in between are sunburned.<br><br> &#x201c;H-8,&#x201d; the woman says. &#x201c;I use the newspaper for my parrot&#x2019;s droppings.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s talk about doubt,&#x201d; the prosecutor says. &#x201c;Reasonable doubt versus an abiding conviction of doubt.&#x201d;<br><br> The church lady raises her hand. &#x201c;What does &#x2018;abiding&#x2019; mean?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The court isn&#x2019;t allowed to define terms,&#x201d; the judge intervenes. &#x201c;And you can&#x2019;t look up the word on your smartphone tonight. You aren&#x2019;t allowed to consider any information, including the definition of a word, outside this court. I dismissed a juror last year for looking up &#x2018;prudent.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br> The prosecutor studies his polished shoes until the judge finishes. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s talk about common sense,&#x201d; he says, walking over to the church lady. &#x201c;How did you decide what to eat for breakfast?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I looked in my fridge.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;So you accepted the evidence before you and made a decision.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I had scrambled eggs.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Okay, let&#x2019;s take a more important decision, one that you had to think hard about.&#x201d; He looks over at F-17. &#x201c;Are you married?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; F-17 says.<br><br> &#x201c;You?&#x201d; the prosecutor asks C-2. <br><br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;How did you decide to marry your husband?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Our accountant told us we would save money on taxes,&#x201d; she says. <br><br> They&#x2019;d been living together for over five years. They loved each other. The money could be spent on a vacation, something they had never allowed themselves. They had traveled extensively on assign�ment, but only to places where the tourists had fled. This time they decided to go somewhere exotic where there wasn&#x2019;t a war. But without a war, they almost killed each other. <br><br> &#x201c;So you would say your decision making is more swayed by facts than emotion?&#x201d; asks the prosecutor. <br><br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; C-2 says. <br><br> A hand goes up, the twitchy alternate&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Why are you asking us all these questions? Why don&#x2019;t they have professional jurors?&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Myths of the Asanas: The Ancient Origins of Yoga</h2><p>Practitioners around the world reap the physical benefits of yoga, assuming poses and frequently calling them by their Sanskrit names. While many know that hanumanasana is named for the deity Hanuman, few understand why this is the case. Behind each asana and its corresponding movements is an ancient story about a god, sage, or sacred animal, much like Aesop&#x2019;s fables or European folktales. Myths of the Asanas is the first book to collect and retell these ancient stories. The myths behind yoga&#x2019;s spiritual tradition have the power to help students of all levels realize their full potential. Meditating on the tolerance of trees while standing in tree pose can help one become more tolerant. Learning how the disfigured sage Astavakra came to be the teacher of a king can liberate us from anxieties about our external appearance and our self imposed limitations. Marveling at Hanuman&#x2019;s devotion to Ram can serve as a source of spiritual strength and determination. With more than sixty beautiful illustrations to frame the stories, Myths of the Asanas will add a new dimension to your practice and study of yoga.</p><p>Alanna Kaivalya, also known as &#34;The JivaDiva,&#34; produces the JivaDiva Yoga Jam podcast, which has been heard by over a million people worldwide.

Yates traces the art of memory from its treatment by Greek orators, through its Gothic transformations in the Middle Ages, to the occult forms it took in the Renaissance, and finally to its use in the seventeenth century. This book, the first to relate the art of memory to the history of culture as a whole, was revolutionary when it first appeared and continues to mesmerize readers with its lucid and revelatory insights.</p><p>Dame Frances Yates (1899-1981) achieved a world-wide reputation as an historian. Her close association with the Warburg Institute of the University of London began shortly after the Second World War, after the publication of her first two books. She was Reader in the History of the Renaissance there until 1967, when she became an Honorary Fellow. As well as gaining many academic honours, she was awarded the OBE in 1977 and was made DBE, in the same year. Her publications include Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, Theatre of the World, The Rosicrucian Enlightenment, Astraea, Shakespeare&#39;s Last Plays and The Valois Tapestries.The ancient Greeks, to whom a trained memory was of vital importance - as it was to everyone before the invention of printing - created an elaborate memory system, based on a technique of impressing &#39;places&#39; and &#39;images&#39; on the mind. Inherited and recorded by the Romans, this art of memory passed into the European tradition, to be revived, in occult form, at the Renaissance, and particularly by the strange and remarkable genius, Giordano Bruno. Such is the main theme of Frances Yates&#39;s unique and brilliant book, in the course of which she sheds light on such diverse subjects as Dante&#39;s Divine Comedy, the form of the Shakespearian theatre and the history of ancient architecture. Aside from its intrinsic fascination, The Art of Memory is an invaluable contribution to aesthetics and psychology, and to the history of philosophy, of science and of literature.</p><h2>Doctor Who : Two Novels</h2><p>Direct to you from Doctor Who, the hit BBC television program that has enchanted fans of the fantastic for more than 50 years, comes this collection of two novels featuring the TARDIS-traveling Eleventh Doctor and his loyal companions Amy and Rory. The Silent Stars Go By by Dan Abnett. The winter festival is approaching for the hardy colony of Morphans, but no one is in the mood to celebrate. They're trying to build a new life on a cold new world, but each year it gets harder and harder. It's almost as though some dark force is working against them. Then three mysterious travelers arrive out of the midwinter night. Are they bringing the gift of salvation, or doom? What else lurks out there in the dark-and what else might be about to wake up? Touched by an Angel by Jonathan Morris. In 2003, Rebecca Whitaker died in a road accident. Her husband Mark is still grieving when he receives a battered envelope posted eight years earlier, containing a set of instructions with a simple message: "You can save her." As Mark is given the chance to save Rebecca, it's up to the Doctor, Amy, and Rory to save the whole world-because this time the Weeping Angels are using history itself as a weapon. Doctor Who: Two Novels is one of Barnes &amp; Noble's Collectible Editions classics. Each volume features authoritative texts by the world's greatest authors in an exquisitely designed bonded-leather binding, with distinctive gilt edging and an attractive ribbon bookmark. Decorative, durable, and collectible, these books offer hours of pleasure to readers young and old and are an indispensable cornerstone for every home library.</p><p></p><h2>Water in Plain Sight: Hope for a Thirsty World</h2><p><p>Water scarcity is on everyone's mind. Long taken for granted, water availability has entered the realm of economics, politics, and people's food and lifestyle choices. But as anxiety mounts - even as a swath of California farmland has been left fallow and extremist groups worldwide exploit the desperation of people losing livelihoods to desertification - many are finding new routes to water security with key implications for food access, economic resilience, and climate change.</p><p>Water does not perish, nor require millions of years to form as do fossil fuels. However, water is always on the move. In this timely, important book, Judith D. Schwartz presents a refreshing perspective on water that transcends zero-sum thinking. By allying with the water cycle, we can revive lush, productive landscapes. Like the river in rural Zimbabwe that, thanks to restorative grazing, now flows miles further than in living memory. Or the food forest of oranges, pomegranates, and native fruit-bearing plants in Tucson, grown through harvesting urban wastewater. Or the mini-oasis in West Texas nourished by dew.</p><p>Animated by stories from around the globe, <i>Water In Plain Sight</i> is an inspiring reminder that fixing the future of our drying planet involves understanding what makes natural systems thrive.</p></p><p><b>Judith D. Schwartz</b> is a journalist whose recent work looks at soil as a hub for multiple environmental, economic, and social challenges and solutions. She writes on this theme for numerous publications and speaks in venues around the world.

According to Joshua Trachtenberg, it is not possible truly to understand the experience and history of the Jewish people without attempting to recover their folklife and beliefs from centuries past.<br><br>Jewish Magic and Superstition is a masterful and utterly fascinating exploration of religious forms that have all but disappeared yet persist in the imagination. The volume begins with legends of Jewish sorcery and proceeds to discuss beliefs about the evil eye, spirits of the dead, powers of good, the famous legend of the golem, procedures for casting spells, the use of gems and amulets, how to battle spirits, the ritual of circumcision, herbal folk remedies, fortune telling, astrology, and the interpretation of dreams.<br><br>First published more than sixty years ago, Trachtenberg's study remains the foundational scholarship on magical practices in the Jewish world and offers an understanding of folk beliefs that expressed most eloquently the everyday religion of the Jewish people.</p></p><p>Rabbi Joshua Trachtenberg was born in London in 1904 and died in 1959, having devoted nearly three decades of service in the American rabbinate. He is the author of &#39;The Devil and the Jews&#39; (1943); &#39;Consider the Years&#39; (1944); and the present work.Of all the charges against the Jewish people the one that has enjoyed the hardiest tenacity and the utmost notoriety, and has produced the direct consequences, is the ritual murder accusation. In its popular version it foists upon Jewish ritual the requirement of Christian blood at the Passover service. The subject of much study and infinitely more polemics, its absurdity has been conclusively established, but the true nature of the accusation has never been made sufficiently clear. The legend as we know it has experienced several redactions - and of the idea of the Jew as sorcerer. --excerpt from &#39;Jewish Magic and Superstition&#39;</p><h2>Diary: A Novel</h2><p><p>&#x201c;CAN YOU <i>FEEL</i> THIS?&#x201d;<br><br>Chuck Palahniuk, the bestselling author of <i>Fight Club</i>, <i>Choke</i>, and <i>Lullaby</i> continues his twenty-first-century reinvention of the horror novel in this scary and profound look at our quest for some sort of immortality.<br><br><i>Diary</i> takes the form of a &#x201c;coma diary&#x201d; kept by one Misty Tracy Wilmot as her husband lies senseless in a hospital after a suicide attempt.

Even Lily's mother, whose usual and acknowledged place was at her writing desk or in a classroom, had come to help; everyone must, this close to harvest. The women must, Lily corrected herself: the men were in the cool of the forests.<br><br>She glanced up and caught sight of her mother, all furious concentration as she moved along her row. She swung her hoe with the same easy rhythm as Many-Doves. They were an army of two marching through the tasseled rows, corn brushing shoulders and cheeks as if to thank the women for their care.<br><br>For all their lives the Mohawk women had spent the best part of every summer day in the fields tending the three sisters: corn, beans, squash. But Lily's mother had been raised in a great English manor house with servants, and she had not held a hoe in her hands--white skin, ink-stained fingers--until she was thirty. Elizabeth Middleton had come to New-York as a spinster, a teacher, a crusader; in just six months' time she had become someone very different.<br><br>Lily understood a simple truth: the day came for every woman when she must choose one kind of life or another or let someone else make the choice for her. For some the crucial moment came suddenly, without warning and when least expected; others saw it approaching, pushing up out of the ground like a weed.<br><br>It was an image that would not leave her mind, and so she had finally spoken about it to her mother, holding the idea out in open palms like the egg of an unfamiliar and exotic bird.<br><br>And how it had pleased her mother, this simple gift. She sat contemplating her folded hands for a moment, Quaker-gray eyes fixed on the horizon and a tilt to her head that meant her mind was far away, reliving some moment, recalling a phrase read last week or ten years ago. When she spoke, finally, it was not with the quotation Lily expected.<br><br>She said, "There are so many choices available to you, such riches for the taking. The very best advice I can give you is very simple. You have heard me say it in different ways, but I'll put it as simply as I can. When it comes time to choose, try to favor the rational over the subjective."<br><br>At that Lily had laughed out loud, in surprise and disappointment. Who else had a mother who would say such a thing, and in such a studiously odd way? Other people were satisfied with quoting the bible and old wives' wisdoms, but Lily had a mother who preferred Kant to the Proverbs. Who made decisions with her head when she could, and was convinced that in doing so, her other needs would be satisfied.<br><br>Certainly she could point to even the most unconventional choices she had made in her life and argue that they were rational, and more than that: that she was happy with the choices she had made. As most of the other women Lily knew were happy with the lives they had.<br><br>Her cousin Kateri had chosen a husband from the Turtle clan at Good Pasture and gone with him to live among the Mohawk on the Canadian side of the St. Lawrence. It was too early yet to know how well she had chosen, or how badly. Other women misstepped and struggled mightily forever after; there were a few like that in Paradise, burning bright with the anger they must swallow day by day.<br><br>And then there was Hannah, her own sister, who had chosen to leave home and chosen well, in spite of the fact that the wars in the west had taken it all away from her. Now she was neither angry nor content but merely alive, as placid and blank as the clouds overhead and just as distant.<br><br>The war was coming closer all the time, and while they had not heard a single shot fired and none of the men had gone to join the fighting--not yet, Lily corrected herself--there were casualties. Lily counted herself among them.<br><br>Without the war she would have left two months ago for New-York City. The plan had taken a full year to finalize: she would live with her uncle and aunt Spencer in their fine house on Whitehall Street and study art with the teachers they had found for her. In time, when she had advanced far enough, she would travel with them to Europe where she could study the work of the great artists.<br><br>But all of that had come to a sudden end, because men must fight and to do that they started wars. Her own brother was infected with that need, her twin brother. The strangeness of it never faded.<br><br>Many-Doves was telling a story. Lily's mother laughed in response, a gentle hiccupping laughter that meant she was embarrassed. All these years living among the plain-speaking Kahnyen'kehoka women, but her mother still blushed and laughed like a proper young English lady when the talk turned to men and women and the things they were to each other.<br><br>This is the life my mother chose. Lily repeated this sentence to herself often, and every time she was overcome with admiration and resentment in equal measure.<br>When Many-Doves decided the time was right they put down the hoes to eat in the shade of the birch trees. Lily filled empty gourds with water from the stream and they unwrapped a parcel of cornbread and boiled eggs and peppery radishes plucked this morning from the kitchen garden, still trailing clots of damp earth. Lily listened for a while as they talked about the coming harvest and the day's work.<br><br>When it was clear that today was not the day they would decide among themselves what was to be done to heal Hannah, Lily went off to wade in the lake, digging her toes into the mud and pulling her skirts up through her belt so that the duck grass tickled her bare calves. She wet her handkerchief and wiped her face and the back of her neck free of dust and grit, thankful for the cool and the breeze and the very colors of the sky. Lily felt her mother watching her, her love and pride and worry radiating as hot and true as the sun itself.<br><br>The sound of drumming hooves brought her out of her daydream. The others heard it too, all of them turning in the direction of the village, their heads tilted at just the same angle, listening hard.<br><br>"Riders!" Her brother Gabriel exploded out of a clump of grass almost under Lily's nose, all pinwheeling arms and legs and spraying water. Annie, Many-Doves' daughter, was just behind him and they galloped toward the women, both of them sleekly wet and naked. Gabriel's skin was burned almost as dark as Annie's, so that his gray eyes worked silver.<br><br>"Five riders!" Annie shouted as if she must make herself heard on the top of the mountain.<br><br>"We hear." Many-Doves raised a hand to screen out the sun as she looked in the direction of the village.<br><br>"Your Uncle Todd's letter said he hoped to be home today," Lily's mother said, wiping her neck with a kerchief. "But who does he have with him?" Her expression was a combination of worry and anticipation and excitement too.<br><br>"Whoever it is, they must be lost," Lily said, wishing herself wrong even as she said the words. "No stranger ever comes to Paradise on purpose."<br><br>The cornfield was on a little rise that gave them a good view of the village on the other side of the lake: the building that had once been the church but now was just a meetinghouse, as no minister seemed to want to stay in Paradise; the well; the dusty road that widened in front of the trading post and then narrowed again to disappear almost immediately into the woods; a few cabins; the smithy; here and there a curl of smoke from a chimney they could not see.<br><br>Every year Paradise was a little smaller, like an old woman hunching down into her bones. When a family gave up and moved on the cabin stayed empty and the garden around it lay fallow, simply because Uncle Todd could not be bothered to look for new tenants. At this moment the only sign of life was a cat asleep on the wall of the well, her fur gleaming in the sun. But folks would come soon enough: so many riders at once was almost as good as a fire for waking them up.<br><br>The sound of hooves on the road grew louder and louder still, and then the riders showed themselves. Five of them, as Annie had foretold. Uncle Todd and cousin Ethan among them--Lily made out that much and nothing about the others; she did not have her father's keen eyesight. Gabriel had it, though. Gabriel and Daniel and all her brothers; eyesight keen enough to count acorns on the highest branch. And now young Gabriel had caught sight of something that made every muscle quiver. He turned his head toward the women and his eyes were perfectly round with anticipation.<br><br>"Yes," Elizabeth said, answering the question he hadn't asked. "But put your breechclout on first. You too, Annie, you can't go greet people in such a state."<br><br>To Lily she said, "That will slow them down a little, at least. Come along, maybe we can get there first."<br><br>Without any discussion Many-Doves began to gather the hoes together.<br><br>"But there's six hours of sun left," Lily said as her mother moved off. She found herself as uneasy about the strangers as she had been eager to see them just a moment ago.<br><br>Many-Doves laughed and poked her shoulder with two fingers. "As if you could work now with your brother just come home."<br><br>All of the riders had dismounted but for one, a smaller figure--a lady by her bearing, Lily saw now. One of the men had a hand on the woman's saddle, his head canted up to talk to her--argue with her, Lily corrected herself, taking in the way he held himself--and in that moment she recognized him.<br><br>"Luke," she said.<br><br>Her brother Luke, come from Montreal without word or warning, and in time of war. Lily felt the shock of it in the tips of her fingers, shock and joy and a flash of fear.<br><br>Lily's mother had recognized him too,...</p><h2>Christian Apologetics</h2><p>The standard for Christian apologetics, this systematic approach presents both the methods and reasons for defending Christianity.</p><p>Norman L.

Previously an associate pastor at Life Christian Church in St. Louis, Missouri, she developed, coordinated, and taught a weekly meeting known as "Life In The Word."

Finding herself in the same situation many years ago and having found freedom to live in victory through applying God's Word, Joyce goes equipped to set captives free and to exchange ashes for beauty. She believes that every person who walks in victory leads many others into victory.

He and Cameron &#x201c;Buck&#x201d; Williams, who had been on Rayford's plane, launch a frantic search for the truth.</p><p>Piloting his 747, Rayford Steele is musing about his wife Irene's irritating religiosity and contemplating the charms of his "drop-dead gorgeous" flight attendant, Hattie. First Irene was into Amway, then Tupperware, and now it's the Rapture of the Saints--the scary last story in the Bible in which Christians are swept to heaven and unbelievers are left behind to endure the Antichrist's Tribulation. Steele believes he'll put the plane on autopilot and go visit Hattie. But Hattie's in a panic: some of the passengers have disappeared! The Rapture has happened, abruptly driverless cars are crashing all over, and the slick, sinister Romanian Nicolae Carpathia plans to use the UN to establish one world government and religion. Resembling "a young Robert Redford" and silver-tongued in nine languages, Carpathia is named <i>People</i>'s "Sexiest Man Alive."

A graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, and the UCLA School of Law, he worked as a lawyer before trying his hand at cartooning. Pastis lives in the Bay Area with his wife and two children.Gr 3-6&#x2013;While Pastis's somewhat controversial Pearls Before Swine has been in syndication since 2000, this is the first time a collection has been curated specifically for a younger audience. Beginning Pearls organizes the strips by character, with each section featuring Rat, Pig, Goat, Zebra, and the Crocs, respectively. The art is fairly simple&#x2013;the figures have stick arms and legs, and the action is minimal, often taking place behind a table, desk, or brick wall. Background details are spare, if they exist at all. Because of the nature of comic strips, this minimalism doesn't detract from the overall effect and may even enhance it. Color has been added to the daily strips, a nice bonus for those who may have seen the material before. As for the content, Pastis cites a number of influences on his strip&#x2013;including Peanuts, Calvin and Hobbes, Dilbert, and the Far Side&#x2013;and Pearls's humor effectively channels them while still being unique. Fans of the aforementioned titles won't be disappointed. The only drawback is that the nine-by-six inch book size is not ideal for comic strips. The last (usually third) panel of the strip is placed below the first two on the page and enlarged to reduce the white space around it. It's not only visually awkward, but it also has an unintended consequence of overemphasizing the punch line, which&nbsp;is,&nbsp;more often than not,&nbsp;funny because of its understatement. Sunday strips, marked by a solid color background over two pages, fare much better.&#x2013;J. M. Poole, Webster Public Library, NY&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Yet he vowed to survive&#x2013;he would become welterweight champion of the world, he would dream heroic dreams. <br>But his dreams were nothing compared to what awaited him. For he embarked on an epic journey, where he would learn the power of words, the power to transform lives, and the mystical power that would sustain him even when it appeared that villainy would rule the world: The Power of One.</p><p>In the Ballantine publicity department, we have an informal book club. It usually gets started is when one of us reads a book, loves it, and then passes it on to a friend in the department. Once one person has read a book and loves it, then we ALL have to read it too! THE POWER OF ONE by Bryce Courtenay was one of those books. You may have seen the movie with Morgan Freeman, but I urge you to read the book because it was much better than the movie. It's a coming-of-age story of a young boy in South Africa. He has such a hard time of things! He's picked on as a young boy, then he befriends an older man who teaches him the wonders of life. The book is beautifully written, and the story is extremely compelling.

A weak and friendless boy growing up in South Africa during World War II, Peekay turns to two older men, one black and one white, to show him how to find the courage to dream, to succeed, to triumph over a world when all seems lost, and to inspire him to summon up the most irrersistible force of all: the Power of One.</p><h2>The Scriptures</h2><p>This new English translation includes Genesis through Revelation.

It was the spring of 2009, and I had set out to walk the full length of the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine. My departure date was timed so that I would transition seamlessly from a mild southern spring to a balmy northern summer, but for some reason the warmth never arrived. It stayed cool that year, rained often. Newspapers likened it to the freak summer of 1816, when cornfields froze to their roots, pink snow fell over Italy, and a young Mary Shelley, locked up in a gloomy villa in Switzerland, began to dream of monsters. My memories of the hike consist chiefly of wet stone and black earth. The vistas from many of the mountaintops were blotted out. Shrouded in mist, rain hood up, eyes downcast, mile after mile, month after month, I had little else to do but study the trail beneath my nose with Talmudic intensity.<br> <br>In his novel The Dharma Bums, Jack Kerouac refers to this kind of walking as &#x201c;the meditation of the trail.&#x201d; Japhy Ryder, a character modeled after the Zen poet Gary Snyder, advises his friend to &#x201c;walk along looking at the trail at your feet and don&#x2019;t look about and just fall into a trance as the ground zips by.&#x201d; Trails are seldom looked at this intently. When hikers want to complain about a particularly rough stretch of trail, we gripe that we spent the whole day looking down at our feet. We prefer to look up, away, off into the distance. Ideally, a trail should function like a discreet aide, gracefully ushering us through the world while still preserving our sense of agency and independence. Perhaps this is why, for virtually all of literary history, trails have remained in the periphery of our gaze, down at the bottommost edge of the frame: they have been, quite literally, beneath our concern.<br> <br>As hundreds&#x2014;and then thousands&#x2014;of miles of trail passed beneath my eyes, I began to ponder the meaning of this endless scrawl. Who created it? Why does it exist? Why, moreover, does any trail?<br> <br>Even after I reached the end of the AT, these questions followed me around. Spurred on by them, and sensing in some vague way that they might lead to new intellectual ground, I began to search for the deeper meaning of trails. I spent years looking for answers, which led me to yet bigger questions: Why did animal life begin to move in the first place? How does any creature start to make sense of the world? Why do some individuals lead and others follow? How did we humans come to mold our planet into its current shape? Piece by piece, I began to cobble together a panoramic view of how pathways act as an essential guiding force on this planet: on every scale of life, from microscopic cells to herds of elephants, creatures can be found relying on trails to reduce an overwhelming array of options to a single expeditious route. Without trails, we would be lost.<br> <br>My quest to find the nature of trails often proved trickier than I had expected. Modern hiking trails loudly announce their presence with brightly painted signs and blazes, but older trails are more inconspicuous. The footpaths of some ancient indigenous societies, like the Cherokee, were no more than a few inches wide. When Europeans invaded North America, they slowly widened parts of the native trail network, first to accommodate horses, then wagons, then automobiles. Now, much of that network is buried beneath modern roadways, though remnants of the old trail system can still be found when you know where&#x2014;and how&#x2014;to look.<br> <br>Other trails are yet more obscure. The trails of some woodland mammals dimple the underbrush so faintly that only an experienced tracker can point them out. Ants nose along chemical pathways that are wholly invisible. (One trick to seeing them, I learned, is to sprinkle the area with lycopodium, the same powder police use to dust for fingerprints.) A few trails are tucked away underground: termites and naked mole-rats carve tunnels through the earth, marking them with traces of pheromones to keep their bearings. Finer still are the tangled neural pathways within a single human brain, which are so multitudinous that even the world&#x2019;s most advanced computers cannot yet map them all. Technology, meanwhile, is busy knitting itself into an intricate network of pathways, dug deep underfoot and strung ethereally overhead, so that information can race across continents.<br> <br>I learned that the soul of a trail&#x2014;its trail-ness&#x2014;is not bound up in dirt and rocks; it is immaterial, evanescent, as fluid as air. The essence lies in its function: how it continuously evolves to serve the needs of its users. We tend to glorify trailblazers&#x2014;those hardy souls who strike out across uncharted territory, both figurative and physical&#x2014;but followers play an equally important role in creating a trail. They shave off unnecessary bends and brush away obstructions, improving the trail with each trip. It is thanks to the actions of these walkers that the trail becomes, in the words of Wendell Berry, &#x201c;the perfect adaptation, through experience and familiarity, of movement to place.&#x201d; In bewildering times&#x2014;when all the old ways seem to be dissolving into mire&#x2014;it serves us well to turn our eyes earthward and study the oft-overlooked wisdom beneath our feet.<br> <br>+<br> <br>I was ten years old when I first glimpsed that a trail could be something more than a strip of bare dirt. That summer, my parents shipped me off to a small, antiquated summer camp in Maine called Pine Island, where there was no electricity or running water, only kerosene lanterns and cold lake. During the second of my six weeks there, a handful of us boys were loaded into a van and driven many hours away to the base of Mount Washington, for what was to be my first backpacking trip. As a child of the concretized prairies of suburban Illinois, I was apprehensive. The act of lugging a heavy pack through the mountains looked suspiciously like one of those penitent rituals that adults sometimes forced themselves to perform, like visiting distant relatives or eating crusts of bread.<br> <br>I was wrong, though; it was worse. Our counselors had allotted us three days to climb the eight miles to the top of Mount Washington and back down, which should have been ample time. But the trail was steep, and I was scrawny. My backpack&#x2014;a heavy, ill-fitting, aluminum-�framed Kelty&#x2014;resembled a piece of full-body orthodontia. After only an hour of climbing the wide rocky trail leading up Tuckerman Ravine, my stiff new leather boots had already begun to blister my toes and rasp the skin from my heels. A hot liquid ache perfused the muscles of my back. When my counselors weren&#x2019;t looking, I made pleading, pained faces at passing strangers, as if this were all part of some elaborate kidnapping. That night, as I lay in my sleeping bag in the lean-to, I considered the logistics of an escape.<br> <br>On the second morning, a gray rain blew in. Instead of summiting the peak, which our counselors deemed unsafe, we took a long hike around the southern flank of the mountain. We left our packs back at the shelter, each of us carrying only a single water bottle and a pocketful of snacks. Free from the dreaded weight of my pack, warm inside my rubberized rain poncho, I began to enjoy myself. I inhaled the fir-sweet air, exhaled fog. The forest gave off a faint chlorophyllic glow.<br> <br>We walked in single file, floating through the trees like little ghosts. After an hour or two, we rose above the tree line and entered a realm of lichen-crusted rock and white mist. The trails around the mountain branched and twined. At the juncture with the Crawford Path, one of our counselors announced that we were turning onto a leg of the Appalachian Trail. His tone suggested we were meant to be impressed. I had heard that name before, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure what it meant. The path beneath our feet, he explained, followed the spine of the Appalachians north to Maine and south all the way to the state of Georgia, almost two thousand miles away.<br> <br>I still recall the tingle of wonder I felt upon hearing these words. The plain-looking trail beneath my feet had suddenly grown to colossal scale. It was as if I had dived down into the camp lake and discovered the slow, undulant vastness of a blue whale. Small as I felt back then, it was a thrill to grasp something so immense, if only by the very tip of its tail.<br> <br>+<br> <br>I kept hiking. It got easier&#x2014;or rather, I got tougher. My pack and boots softened until they slid into place with the dry fluidity of an old baseball glove. I learned to move nimbly beneath a heavy load and push on for hours without breaks. I also came to savor the satisfaction of dropping my pack at the end of a long day: the warm animal weight would fall coolly away, and I would rise from my burden with a weird heliated feeling, as if my toes were merely grazing the dirt.<br> <br>Hiking proved to be the perfect pastime for a free-floating kid like me. My mother once gave me a leather-bound journal that was meant to have my name embossed in gold along the spine, but instead the printer erroneously engraved the words ROBERT MOON. The mistake was oddly fitting. Growing up, I often felt extraterrestrial. It wasn&#x2019;t that I was lonely or ostracized; I just never felt fully at home. Before I went off to college, no one knew I was gay, and I knew no other gay people. I did my best to blend in. Each year I would dutifully put on a suit and tie for the spring formal, the cotillion, or the prom. I donned athletic uniforms, first-date uniforms, drinking-pilfered-cans-of-Old-Style-in-a-friend&#x2019;s-basement uniforms. All the while, though, part of me wondered: What&#x2019;s the point of this elaborately costumed performance we put on?<br> <br>In my family I was the youngest child by nearly a decade. My parents, who were already in their forties by the time I was born, granted me an unusual amount of freedom. I could have run wild. Instead, I spent much of my time in my room reading books, which, I discovered, was like running away from home, minus the risk and parental heartache. And so, from the third grade on, I burned through books the way a chain-smoker smokes, picking up one even as I was extinguishing the last.<br> <br>The book that kicked off my habit in earnest was a flimsy paperback copy of Little House in the Big Woods. I learned that my home, in northern Illinois, was just a few hundred miles southeast of where the book&#x2019;s author, Laura Ingalls Wilder, was born in 1867. However, her descriptions of the Big Woods of Wisconsin were wholly foreign to me. &#x201c;As far as a man could go to the north in a day, or a week, or a whole month, there was nothing but woods,&#x201d; she wrote. &#x201c;There were no houses. There were no roads. There were no people. There were only trees and the wild animals who had their homes among them.&#x201d; I was intoxicated by Ingalls&#x2019;s sense of isolation and self-reliance.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t remember how many of the Little House books I read in a row, but it was enough to require an intervention from my teacher, who gently suggested I move on to something else. In the coming years I progressed from Little House to Hatchet to Walden to A Sand County Almanac to Pilgrim at Tinker Creek. I enjoyed lingering over the minutiae of a life spent outdoors. During my first summer at Pine Island, I discovered a parallel genre of wilderness adventure books: first the boyish yarns of Mark Twain and Jack London, then the alpine reveries of John Muir, the Antarctic agonies of Ernest Shackleton, and the existential odysseys of Robyn Davidson and Bruce Chatwin.<br> <br>These two lineages of outdoor writers were roughly divided between those who were deeply rooted to a piece of land and those who were proudly untethered. I preferred the drifters. I held no profound connection to my land, my ancestors, my culture, my community, my gender, or my race. I was raised without religion, and without hatred of religion. My family was diffuse: my parents, two Texans living in the frigid North, were already divorced by the time I was in the first grade; not long after, my two older sisters went away to college and never moved back. A vague restlessness seemed to run in our blood.<br> <br>Nine months out of every year I drifted through the halls of one academic institution after another, changing costumes, learning new dialects, faking fluency. It was only during the summers, on a series of ever-lengthening sojourns in the wilderness, that I felt wholly natural. I worked my way up from the Appalachians to the mighty Rockies, then to the Beartooths, the Winds, the snowy behemoths of the Alaska Range, and, later, high-altitude peaks ranging from Mexico to Argentina. Up there, far from etiquette or ritual, I could walk unscrutinized, unbound.<br> <br>For two summers in college I took a job back at Pine Island leading kids on short hikes through the Appalachians. On trips along the AT I would occasionally bump into hikers who were attempting to walk the trail&#x2019;s full length in a single, mammoth, months-long effort. These &#x201c;thru-hikers&#x201d; were easy to spot: They introduced themselves with odd &#x201c;trail names,&#x201d; ate ravenously, and walked with a light, lupine gait. I was intimidated by them, but also envious. They resembled the rock musicians of an idealized past&#x2014;the same long hair, the same wild beards, the same wasted physiques, the same esoteric argot, the same peripatetic lifestyle, the same faint, vain awareness of being, in a way, heroic.<br> <br>I sometimes talked with these thru-hikers, plying them with chunks of cheese or handfuls of candy. I remember one old man who had hiked the whole trail in a Scottish kilt and sandals, and a young man who carried no tent, but a full feather pillow. A few of them proselytized zealously for one church or another, while others spoke of preparing for a looming ecological apocalypse. Many of the people I talked to were between jobs, between schools, or between marriages. I met soldiers returning from war and people recovering from a death in the family. Certain stock phrases were repeated. &#x201c;I needed some time to clear my head,&#x201d; they said, or &#x201c;I knew this might be my last chance.&#x201d; One summer during college, I told a young thru-�hiker that I hoped to make an attempt someday. &#x201c;Drop out,&#x201d; he told me flatly. &#x201c;Do it now.&#x201d;<br> <br>+<br> <br>I did not drop out. I was too careful for that. In 2008 I moved to New York, where I worked a series of low-paying jobs. In my free time I planned my thru-hike. I read guidebooks and online message boards, drew up tentative itineraries. Less than a year later I was ready to embark.<br> <br>Unlike many people, I had no clear impetus for going on a long hike, no inciting incident. I wasn&#x2019;t grieving a death or recovering from drug addiction. I wasn&#x2019;t fleeing anything. I had never been to war. I wasn&#x2019;t depressed. I was maybe only a little insane. My thru-hike was not an attempt to find myself, find peace, or find God.<br> <br>Perhaps, as they say, I simply needed some time to clear my head; perhaps I knew this might be my last chance. Both were mostly true, as clich�s often are. I also wanted to find out what it would be like to spend months on end in the wilderness, to live in a prolonged state of freedom. But more than that, I think I wanted to answer a challenge that had loomed over me since childhood. When I was small and frail, hiking the whole trail had seemed a herculean task. As I grew, its impossibility became precisely its appeal.<br> <br>+<br> <br>Over the years, I had picked up some useful tips from the thru-hikers I&#x2019;d met. Above all, I knew that weight was the enemy of a successful thru-hike, so I retired my trusty old pack and invested in a new ultralight one. Then I traded in my ...</p><h2>Adventures of an IT Leader</h2><p>Becoming an effective IT manager presents a host of challenges--from anticipating emerging technology to managing relationships with vendors, employees, and other managers.

So it&#x2019;s a computer, yes?&#x201d;<br> <br>The sales assistant nods. Then hesitates and quickly shakes his head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes . . . or, what I mean is, it&#x2019;s an iPad. Some people call it a &#x2018;tablet&#x2019; and others call it a &#x2018;surfing device.&#x2019; There are different ways of looking at it. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove looks at the sales assistant as if he has just spoken backwards, before shaking the box again.<br> <br>&#x201c;But is it good, this thing?&#x201d;<br> <br>The assistant nods confusedly. &#x201c;Yes. Or . . . How do you mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove sighs and starts talking slowly, articulating his words as if the only problem here is his adversary&#x2019;s impaired hearing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is. It. Goooood? Is it a good computer?&#x201d;<br> <br>The assistant scratches his chin.<br> <br>&#x201c;I mean . . . yeah . . . it&#x2019;s really good . . . but it depends what sort of computer you want.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove glares at him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want a computer! A normal bloody computer!&#x201d;<br> <br>Silence descends over the two men for a short while. The assistant clears his throat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well . . . it isn&#x2019;t really a normal computer. Maybe you&#x2019;d rather have a . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>The assistant stops and seems to be looking for a word that falls within the bounds of comprehension of the man facing him. Then he clears his throat again and says:<br> <br>&#x201c;. . . a laptop?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove shakes his head wildly and leans menacingly over the counter.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t want a &#x2018;laptop.&#x2019; I want a computer.&#x201d;<br> <br>The assistant nods pedagogically.<br> <br>&#x201c;A laptop is a computer.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove, insulted, glares at him and stabs his forefinger at the counter.<br> <br>&#x201c;You think I don&#x2019;t know that!&#x201d;<br> <br>Another silence, as if two gunmen have suddenly realized they have forgotten to bring their pistols. Ove looks at the box for a long time, as though he&#x2019;s waiting for it to make a confession.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where does the keyboard pull out?&#x201d; he mutters eventually.<br> <br>The sales assistant rubs his palms against the edge of the counter and shifts his weight nervously from foot to foot, as young men employed in retail outlets often do when they begin to understand that something is going to take considerably more time than they had initially hoped.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, this one doesn&#x2019;t actually have a keyboard.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove does something with his eyebrows. &#x201c;Ah, of course,&#x201d; he splutters. &#x201c;Because you have to buy it as an &#x2018;extra,&#x2019; don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, what I mean is that the computer doesn&#x2019;t have a separate keyboard. You control everything from the screen.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove shakes his head in disbelief, as if he&#x2019;s just witnessed the sales assistant walking around the counter and licking the glass-fronted display cabinet.<br> <br>&#x201c;But I have to have a keyboard. You do understand that?&#x201d;<br> <br>The young man sighs deeply, as if patiently counting to ten.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. I understand. In that case I don&#x2019;t think you should go for this computer. I think you should buy something like a MacBook instead.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A McBook?&#x201d; Ove says, far from convinced. &#x201c;Is that one of those blessed &#x2018;eReaders&#x2019; everyone&#x2019;s talking about?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. A MacBook is a . . . it&#x2019;s a . . . laptop, with a keyboard.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay!&#x201d; Ove hisses. He looks around the shop for a moment. &#x201c;So are they any good, then?&#x201d;<br> <br>The sales assistant looks down at the counter in a way that seems to reveal a fiercely yet barely controlled desire to begin clawing his own face. Then he suddenly brightens, flashing an energetic smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know what? Let me see if my colleague has finished with his customer, so he can come and give you a demonstration.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove checks his watch and grudgingly agrees, reminding the assistant that some people have better things to do than stand around all day waiting. The assistant gives him a quick nod, then disappears and comes back after a few moments with a colleague. The colleague looks very happy, as people do when they have not been working for a sufficient stretch of time as sales assistants.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi, how can I help you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove drills his police-flashlight finger into the counter.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want a computer!&#x201d;<br> <br>The colleague no longer looks quite as happy. He gives the first sales assistant an insinuating glance as if to say he&#x2019;ll pay him back for this.<br> <br>In the meantime the first sales assistant mutters, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t take anymore, I&#x2019;m going for lunch.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lunch,&#x201d; snorts Ove. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the only thing people care about nowadays.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x201d; says the colleague and turns around.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lunch!&#x201d; He sneers, then tosses the box onto the counter and swiftly walks out.</p><h2>Sue Grafton: Three Complete Novels; A, B &amp; C: A is for Alibi; B is for Burglar; C is for Corpse</h2><p>A <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author appears for the first time ever in an omnibus edition!

But when an Elven girl fell hopelessly in love with a Darkling boy of the Void, he carried away more than her heart.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thousands of years later, tumultuous times are upon the world now known as the Four Lands. Users of magic are in conflict with proponents of science. Elves have distanced their society from the other races. The dwindling Druid order and its teachings are threatened with extinction. A sinister politician has used treachery and murder to rise as prime minister of the mighty Federation. Meanwhile, poring through a long-forgotten diary, the young Druid Aphenglow Elessedil has stumbled upon the secret account of an Elven girl&#x2019;s heartbreak and the shocking truth about the vanished Elfstones. But never has a little knowledge been so very dangerous&#x2014;as Aphenglow quickly learns when she&#x2019;s set upon by assassins.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet there can be no turning back from the road to which fate has steered her. For whoever captures the Elfstones and their untold powers will surely hold the advantage in the devastating clash to come. But Aphenglow and her allies&#x2014;Druids, Elves, and humans alike&#x2014;remember the monstrous history of the Demon War, and they know that the Four Lands will never survive another reign of darkness. But whether they themselves can survive the attempt to stem that tide is another question entirely.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>&#x201c;[Terry Brooks is] the most important fantasy writer since J.R.R.

The author was a practicing attorney for many years but now writes full-time. He lives with his wife, Judine, in the Pacific Northwest.1<br><br>It was almost one year to the day after she began her search of the Elven histories that Aphenglow Elessedil found the diary.<br><br>She was deep in the underground levels of the palace, sitting alone at the same table she occupied each day, surrounded by candles to combat the darkness and wrapped in her heavy cloak to ward off the chill. Carefully she read each document, letter, or memoir in what had taken on the attributes of a never-ending slog. It was late and her eyes were burning with fatigue and dust, her concentration beginning to wane, and her longing for bed to grow. She had been reading each day, all day, for so long that she was beginning to think she might never see Paranor and her fellow Druids again.<br><br>It was dark each day when she began her work and dark when she ended it, and aside from an occasional visit from her sister or her uncle, she saw almost no one. She had read through the entirety of the histories, including their appendices, and had moved on to the boxes and boxes of other writings donated by prominent families over the years. These papers were intended to supplement, embellish, or correct what was considered the official record of a history that stretched back thousands of years. She had found little that she didn't already know or was in any way useful, yet she had persevered because that was how she was. Once she started something she did not give up until the job was finished.<br><br>And now, perhaps, it was. A diary, written by a young girl, a Princess of the realm living in the age of Faerie, had caught her eye just as she was on the verge of putting everything aside and going off to bed. It was buried at the bottom of a box she had finished emptying, small and worn and stiff with age, and she had glanced at the first couple of pages, noted the girlish writing and the nature of the entries, and been prepared to dismiss it. But then something had stopped her--curiosity, a premonition, a quirk in the way it was written, and she had paged ahead to the final entries to find something unexpected.<br>23, month 5<br><br>Something both terrible and wonderful has happened to me, and I can tell no one.<br><br>Today I met a boy. He is not of our people and not of our moral and ethical persuasion. He is a Darkling child of the Void, but he is the most beautiful boy I have ever seen. I am hopelessly in love with him, and even knowing that it is wrong of me to be so and that nothing good can come of it, I want to believe that it might be otherwise.<br><br>I was down by the Silver Thread, deep in the woods seeking bunch lilies and ardweed seeds for the shelter, when he appeared to me. He came out of the trees as if born of them, a lovely mirage given substance and form. So striking was he, so perfect. Blue skin (I have never seen such a depthless blue), golden eyes, hair of midnight black and stars, his voice as soft as the ending of a summer rain when he greeted me. I loved him at once, in that first moment. I could not help myself.<br><br>Even when I knew what he was and that he was forbidden to me, I could not turn away from him. I like to believe that there was something more than physical attraction that drew me to him. I had enough presence of mind to be able to warn myself against what I was doing. But after we talked and I heard what he had to say about himself and his people, I knew I could not change things. It is said that the most ancient of our race frequently found love at first sight and seldom through lengthy consideration. Perhaps I am a throwback, for that is what happened with this boy and me.<br><br>We sat in a quiet glade and talked for hours; I cannot say for how long. By the time our encounter ended, twilight was approaching. I left him with a promise to meet again. No plans, no details, but I know it will happen.<br><br>I want it to happen.<br>26, month 5<br><br>Today, unable to help myself, I returned to the forest to try to find him again. I was not back in the glade for more than the half split of an hour before he reappeared. Again, we sat and talked of our lives and our hopes for the future. I feel so free with him, so able to be open about my life. He is the same with me, and I am reassured that the love I feel for him is not built on a foundation of false expectations but on real possibilities. While the prohibitions cannot be changed, I see no reason why they might not be ignored for a time. So I tell myself. So I am persuaded.<br>28, month 5<br><br>We met again today. Our conversations were of ourselves, but also of the strife between our peoples and the terrible toll it was taking on all our lives. He told me he did not see all of his people as bad or all of ours as good. It was not so simple in his eyes, and I was quick to agree with him. The war is ongoing, centuries old, a struggle that has its roots in the beginnings of all our Races and of the world itself, and it will not end in our lives. We are its children, but we feel so apart from the war when together and alone. If only we could keep it that way. If only we could shelter what we feel for each other so that no one could ever destroy it.<br><br>Before we parted, he told me how he had come to find me. He was delegated by his elders to spy upon the city from the particular vantage point into which I had ventured. He was not to interfere, only to observe and report. He hated what he was doing, but it was his duty and his parents would be shamed if he failed. Yet when he saw me, he found he no longer cared about anything else. He had to reveal himself. He had to talk to me.<br><br>By now I am no longer thinking of anything but how to hold on to him, how to make him mine forever.<br>2, month 6<br><br>When he came to me on this day, our first day of meeting in the new month, I gave myself to him. I did so freely and with great joy. We did not speak while it was happening, did not even pause to consider. We simply did what we had wanted to do from the first time we had met. It was so wonderful, and the feelings I experienced while in his arms are with me still and will be so forever. It was my first time, and he is my first real love. I could not ask for anything more wonderful. I have been made happy beyond my wildest expectations. Now that I have taken this final, irrevocable step, there is no going back, nothing more to consider.<br><br>I am his.<br>3, month 6<br><br>We met again today. I couldn't help myself. Nor, I think, could he. We are so in love. We are so happy.<br>5, month 6<br><br>Again. Another sweet time.<br>12, month 6<br><br>Such agony! Mother kept me busy all this week with studies and housework, and I could not go to him even once. Today was our first time together again in an entire week. He says he understands, although it is hard for him, too. I will not suffer such separation again!<br>15, month 6<br><br>Even three days is too long. I was in such despair, and he was so wild with worry and so in need when we met. Oh, how I love him!<br>17, month 6<br><br>Just when I think matters have returned to normal and we will be left to our regular meetings, something else has intruded. I must go to visit my grandparents in the city of Parsoprey across the Dragon's Teeth and down onto the plains of the Sarain and so will be gone for two entire weeks. I cannot go to him to let him know--we are to leave at once! I think I shall die!<br>2, month 7<br><br>Home again at last. I went straight to the glade and took him to our home and into my bed. It feels so right to have him there. I told him everything of where I had been and what I had been forced to endure and he, sweet boy, told me he understood and forgave me. He worried that I had forsaken him and would not return. But I would never do that. He must know this, I told him. I will love him until the day I die.<br>22, month 7<br><br>I take him to my bed at every opportunity, no longer content with our time in the forest glade. I want him close to me. I want him with me always and constantly, but I must settle for what I can have. I choose times when I know the house will be empty. I live for those times. I am consumed by my need for them. I want them to go on forever.<br>10, month 8<br><br>Today I did something that may have been foolish. I spoke of the magic that keeps the Elves safe. I revealed too much of what I knew in an effort to impress--though only after he had done so first, speaking of the magic that keeps his own people safe. We spoke in general terms and not of specifics, but I am troubled nevertheless. We spoke of magic in the course of our frequent discussions on how the war between our peoples might be brought to an end. If there were no magic, there might be less cause for fighting, we reason. He sees it as I do, and so we speak of it openly. It is only talk, and nothing much could come of it. When we are together, what does talk of magic and conjuring and endless conflict matter anyway? Nothing matters, save that we are together.<br><br>But now I wonder. Because even though we spoke mostly in generalities, I did once speak in specifics.<br><br>I told him about the Elfstones.<br>"Aphen, are you still down there?"<br><br>She looked up quickly from the diary. Her uncle. "Still here," she answered.<br><br>She shoved the diary under a pile of papers and took up something else as if she had been looking at that instead. She did so out of habit and instinct, aware not only that was she forbidden to remove anything from the archives but also that she was constantly watched in her comings and goings and never certain who it was that might be doing the watching. Mostly, it was Home Guards stationed at the top of the basement stairs, but it could be anyone. She liked her uncle and was close to him, but to the larger Elven community she had been a pariah for so long that she never took anything for granted.<br><br>A candle's dim light wavered its way down the steps from the level above, and her uncle appeared out of the darkness. "The hours you keep, dear young lady, are ridiculous."<br><br>Ellich Elessedil was the younger of the two brothers who had been in line for the throne many years ago and, to her mind, the one best suited to the task. But his older brother, her grandfather, was the one who had become ruler of the Elves on the death of their parents. Now her grandfather's son, Phaedon, was the designated heir apparent and, as her grandfather continued to weaken from his chronic heart and lung problems, increasingly likely to be King soon. Aphenglow's mother was Phaedon's much younger sister, and her refusal to become involved in the business of the court allowed Aphenglow to remain comfortably clear of family and state politics.<br><br>Not as far clear as she would have liked, however. Her choice to become a member of the Druid order had put an end to that.<br><br>Her uncle took a seat on a stool she was using for stacking notes, moving the papers aside without comment. Though he was actually her great-uncle, Aphen found the designation awkward and called him simply Uncle, mostly as a term of endearment because they were so close. He was tall and lean and as blond as she was, although his hair was beginning to go gray. "It's getting on toward midnight, you know. Whatever's keeping you here could wait until morning."<br><br>She smiled and nodded. "Nothing's really keeping me. I just lost track of time. Thank you for rescuing me."<br><br>He smiled back. "Find anything of interest today?"<br><br>"Nothing." The lie came smoothly. "Same as always. Every morning I think that this will be the day I discover some great secret about the magic, some clue about a lost talisman or a forgotten conjuring. But each night I return to my bed disappointed."<br><br>He looked around the room, taking in the shelves of books and boxes, the reams of papers stacked in their metal holders, the clutter and the scraps of documents and notes. "Perhaps there is nothing to find. Perhaps all you are doing is sorting documents that no one but you will ever read." He glanced back at her. "I'm not trying to discourage you, not after all the work you've put in. I am only wondering if this is a fool's errand."<br><br>"A fool's errand?" she repeated. Her blue eyes flashed. "You think I may have spent the last three hundred and sixty-four days on a fool's errand?"<br><br>He held up his hands in a placating gesture. "That was a poor choice of words. Please forget that I spoke them. I don't know enough about what you are doing to be able to question it with any authority. I only ask because I care about you."<br><br>"You know why I am here, Uncle," she said quietly. "You know the importance of what I am doing."<br><br>"I know that you believe it to be important. But if there is nothing to find, if there is no magic to be found, no talismans to be recovered, then what have you accomplished?"<br><br>"I will have made certain of what you clearly suspect," she answered. "I will have eliminated the possibility that something has been missed. A lot of time has passed and a lot of history been forgotten or lost. We are an old people, after all."<br><br>He shrugged, leaning back on the stool. "Old enough that we are no longer the people we once were and probably never will be again. We have evolved since the Faerie Age. We do not rely on magic as we once did--or certainly not the same kinds of magic. We share the world now with other, different species. The Faerie that served the Void are locked away behind the Forbidding. Now we have humans to deal with instead, a less imaginative people, and the need we once had for protective magic no longer exists."</p><h2>A Journey of the Imagination: The Art of James Christensen</h2><p>Enter a world just a little left of reality.

He layers for our inspection and introspection myths, literature, poetry, nature, black-and-white checkered floors, and everyman as a ``hunchback'' with the cares of the world upon his fragile shoulders. Palpable colored plates on heavy-weight creamy paper serve as canvases for works with titles such as ``The Responsible Woman,'' ``She Would Have Been a Much More Pleasant Person If Her Nose Had Not Been On So Tight,'' and the uplifting ``College of Magical Knowledge.'' The painter writes in his opening essay that he wants people to participate in his art along with him. He discusses how symbols, designs, and metaphors convey new interpretations of reality. He facilitates an understanding of his works with insightful comments about each one. Themes such as fantasy in nature, allegory, life's voyages, the power of fairy tales as proverbs, and other diverse topics are suggested for possible exploration. This book is a rich resource tool for students of all disciplines. YAs' creativity will be stimulated by the clever complexity within its pages, and they will find themselves on a quest to decipher all of the ideas behind the images.</p><p><i>Arlene Hoebel, W.T.

Nicolas and Pauline each take one, and leaning outside they talk sporadically.<br> They look below. A man passes, a bass guitar case in hand. A couple goes in the other direction, they&#x2019;re glued to each other, they don&#x2019;t talk and they slow down to kiss under the windows before taking off again. Apartment opposite, a guy types on his computer keyboard.<br> Pauline spins her glass of burning brown, she has the feeling that everything has simplified. Her desires have become whole, less irksome, things are clearer, plainly outlined. And she finds herself laughing often. She forgets to ask herself how she&#x2019;s behaving, if what she&#x2019;s saying is right, she forgets to keep tabs on herself again and again and feels relieved. She asks:<br> &#x201c;Why did she do it?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I would feel less stupid if at least I knew. I was supposed to be her friend, the guy she could count on. And the only thing I was capable of noticing was that she took a lot of drugs... but I do drugs so much too that it didn&#x2019;t alarm me at all. I didn&#x2019;t find it strange, the desire to be wasted all the time, with the life we live.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What kind of life did she live?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t talk on the phone, now and then?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;She lied to me all the time. She&#x2019;s always been a compulsive liar, so I was skeptical... but I didn&#x2019;t think it would go this far. She said she would make some cash, a whole load of it. She said, &#x2018;In this city, money is everywhere, you can&#x2019;t even imagine. You just have to be in the right place at the right time, and you&#x2019;ve hit the jackpot... and I&#x2019;m in, I&#x2019;m swimming in cash.&#x2019; I rummaged through her things, there were bank statements. At first I was furious that she was on welfare because I thought it was a scheme to get a little more while she was overflowing with money. And then I dug deeper, and she had almost no other money coming in...&#x201d;<br> Nicolas doesn&#x2019;t say anything, lets her continue, taking advantage of her drunkenness to find out some things. She drinks more, a tiny sip, she&#x2019;s furious about what she&#x2019;s learned. She continues:<br> &#x201c;She told me she was a dancer, that she had so many things going on, she couldn&#x2019;t find the time to do it all. Modern dance. Since showing up here, I see why they call it modern. Same for the concert: she presented the idea to me as if it were pure generosity on her part, almost like she didn&#x2019;t need me. She was in contact with everyone, the big shots in the area kept calling her, they were all crazy about her. There was a lot of money on the table, like I was lucky to get a piece of it. It could have been a reality, but she had no idea. Little Miss Liar.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Everyone is like that here. Except for those who don&#x2019;t have to pretend to be important anymore because they actually are. This isn&#x2019;t a city where it&#x2019;s okay to fail. If you admit straight up that you&#x2019;re not making it, you make everyone else too scared, losers contaminate everything, like they&#x2019;re contagious...&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the same for everyone. Why was it absolutely necessary for her to have a better life than the rest of us?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s human. This doesn&#x2019;t mean anything to you? On veut vivre et pas survivre! Un deux un deux trois quatre. On veut pas vivre pas survivre.&#x201d;<br> He moves away from the window and starts to do a sort of dance where he lifts one leg forward and then the other and hops in place, kicks the air. His head moves from right to left, he hums something at the same time.<br> Pauline watches him and finds it bizarre to see him let go of himself like that, it makes her think there&#x2019;s another him, barely still alive inside him. Like the famous nesting dolls, a new Nicolas enveloping another, but sometimes a younger Nicolas comes to take a victory lap and dance a little.<br> He&#x2019;s clearly very drunk. He&#x2019;s become quite red, already sweating a bit. He tacks on:<br> &#x201c;Do you know this one? Quelle sacr�e revanche ! Je croyais l� un mode de vie ce n&#x2019;�tait qu&#x2019;une vie � la mode!&#x201d;<br> He continues doing the same kind of dance, but with his feet together and moving his arms in a bizarre crawl, or an unknown jerk.<br> Pauline is embarrassed by it. She finds it funny. But she&#x2019;s embarrassed to see him let go of himself in front of her. He&#x2019;s showing her something that sober Nicolas wouldn&#x2019;t want her to see.<br> Pounding against the wall.<br> He stops abruptly, out of breath, yells:<br> &#x201c;I already told you never to pound on this wall again, you nasty old hag!&#x201d;<br> But doesn&#x2019;t resume his wriggling. He looks for the lighter on the table, jostles the empty beer bottles, picks up a magazine, asks:<br> &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re that alone? There&#x2019;s no one from your old life that you&#x2019;d regret never seeing again?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> She holds out the lighter that she had actually been holding in her hand, then pushes her glass toward him so that he&#x2019;ll refill it. She makes an effort to reflect, or to figure out how to explain to him.<br> &#x201c;Five minutes before I did it, if you had asked me, I would have said that I liked my life. And it wouldn&#x2019;t have been a lie. I liked my friends, I&#x2019;ve known them forever, I liked my home... I&#x2019;ve never really complained about anything. And then there was that reflex. I didn&#x2019;t have any other choice. It&#x2019;s so clear to me that there&#x2019;s no space for me to regret it.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like that now, it&#x2019;s the shock of the news, but in ten days you&#x2019;ll be back to normal and you&#x2019;ll want to go home. Only you won&#x2019;t be able to anymore.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s done is done.&#x201d;<br> Nicolas tries hard to understand.<br> &#x201c;Why do you hate her so much? Did your daddy love her more?&#x201d;<br> He said it as a joke, except he hit the nail on the head. Pauline tenses, without even trying to conceal it, her eyes narrow slightly.<br> &#x201c;She told you that?&#x201d;<br> Claudine never talked about her parents. Until that night, Nicolas had never paid attention. She had never said a single word about them. He concedes:<br> &#x201c;Yeah, she said it... She said that her father adored her but that you had been a bit of a disappointment to him.&#x201d;<br> Then she starts to cry. Really huge tears fed by the 80-proof alcohol. Even she is amazed to find it feels so good, after having so many tears held back and so much weighing on her heart.<br> Nicolas watches her cry, without moving, without really knowing what he hit on, but the last drink was the thickener, the thing that glues you to the chair and entangles reason. He mumbles from time to time.<br> &#x201c;What I would give to be able to cry like that.&#x201d;<br> Until they were ten years old, their father brought Pauline with him everywhere. Claudine hated her for that.<br> One day, it was school vacation, a room with bunk beds. It must have been in the mountains, because in this memory they were in their winter clothes.<br> At the table, with friends, their father was running his mouth. An alcohol-soaked lunch, he had gone a bit harder than usual. His eyes riveted to little Claudine, ready to disappear under the table, he seemed on the verge of vomiting, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you two came from the same stomach.&#x201d; Then he started to really heap it on, bringing his guests over to bear witness, who also would have liked to crawl under the table to escape his questions, &#x201c;They look alike but one of them&#x2019;s ugly. Right? It&#x2019;s funny, there&#x2019;s barely a difference, it&#x2019;s just that bovine glimmer in her eyes, it makes you want to smack her. Right?&#x201d;<br> The children were at the age when parents still speak bluntly, no matter what they&#x2019;re saying or how unbelievable it is.<br> Their friends took off earlier than planned, visibly angry. Their father had walked around in circles for a few minutes, gestured to Claudine:<br> &#x201c;Come here, you. You understand how ashamed you made me? Do you understand, you little cunt? Come here for your spanking, come closer.&#x201d;<br> And he had snapped his fingers as one calls to a dog. The little girl approached, was given a good thrashing.<br> Behind her, her mother cried:<br> &#x201c;Stop it, don&#x2019;t work yourself up like that, it&#x2019;s nothing, stop...&#x201d;<br> And as soon as he had walked away, she picked up Claudine, sighed:<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re always screwing things up, huh. You can&#x2019;t just make yourself forgotten? Go to your room. Pauline, sweetheart, please go play with your sister. Make sure she doesn&#x2019;t make too much noise, so your father can calm himself down.&#x201d;</p> <p>In the bedroom, Claudine was sitting opposite the window, she was swaying back and forth, humming something between her teeth.<br> Pauline had hesitated for a while, searched for the words, then had come up behind her, timidly caressing her hair. Mouth filled with tears, she had trouble expressing herself.<br> &#x201c;You know, when he speaks to you like that, it&#x2019;s like he&#x2019;s doing it to me.&#x201d;<br> She hadn&#x2019;t felt her sister&#x2019;s shoulders tense up, she had continued, really starting to cry:<br> &#x201c;When he hits you I swear I feel it too.&#x201d;<br> Claudine had stood up, turned to face her, grabbed her by the hair. Pauline didn&#x2019;t scream, so that her parents wouldn&#x2019;t come. Claudine had dragged her down onto the bed.<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure you feel it?&#x201d;<br> And obstructing her face with her hair, had started to bash her, her little fists striking with as much force as possible against her face. To really hurt her, she had taken the pillow and held it down against her sister&#x2019;s face with her two hands. To be absolutely sure she heard, she started to scream:<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s weird, because when he kisses you, I feel nothing.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Grandfathers Journey</h2><p>Through compelling reminiscences of his grandfather&#39;s life in America and Japan, Allen Say gives us a poignant acount of a family&#39;s unique cross-cultural experience. He warmly conveys his own love for his two countries, and the strong and constant desire to be in both places at once.</p><p>Home becomes elusive in this story about immigration and acculturation, pieced together through old pictures and salvaged family tales. Both the narrator and his grandfather long to return to Japan, but when they do, they feel anonymous and confused: &#34;The funny thing is, the moment I am in one country, I am homesick for the other.&#34; Allen Say&#39;s prose is succinct and controlled, to the effect of surprise when monumental events are scaled down to a few words: &#34;The young woman fell in love, married, and sometime later I was born.&#34; The book also has large, formal paintings in delicate, faded colors that portray a cherished and well-preserved family album. The book, for audiences ages 4 to 8, won the 1994 Caldecott Medal.Allen Say was born in Yokohama, Japan, in 1937. He dreamed of becoming a cartoonist from the age of six, and, at age twelve, apprenticed himself to his favorite cartoonist, Noro Shinpei. For the next four years, Say learned to draw and paint under the direction of Noro, who has remained Say&#39;s mentor. Say illustrated his first children&#39;s book -- published in 1972 -- in a photo studio between shooting assignments. For years, Say continued writing and illustrating children&#39;s books on a part-time basis. But in 1987, while illustrating THE BOY OF THE THREE-YEAR NAP (Caldecott Honor Medal), he recaptured the joy he had known as a boy working in his master&#39;s studio. It was then that Say decided to make a full commitment to doing what he loves best: writing and illustrating children&#39;s books. Since then, he has written and illustrated many books, including TREE OF CRANES and GRANDFATHER&#39;S JOURNEY, winner of the 1994 Caldecott Medal. He is a full-time writer and illustrator living in Portland, Oregon.</p><h2>The Nazi Officer&#39;s Wife: How One Jewish Woman Survived the Holocaust</h2><p><p><strong>#1 <em>New York Times</em> Bestseller</strong></p><p>Edith Hahn was an outspoken young woman in Vienna when the Gestapo forced her into a ghetto and then into a slave labor camp.

Pitfalls and problems. How do you even get started? Where and how to begin? Assessing progress. Growing in depth. All of these subjects, and more, are clearly and concisely explained for citizens of this 21st century.</p><p>Whether they recognize it or not, human beings universally experience a hunger for God.

Through your superior observation and deduction, you figure out whodunit. Fortunately, the solutions follow each story. Unfortunately, the vocal characterizations and narrative style of the seven readers make these five-minute mysteries about four minutes too long. The amateurish and dull characterizations sound like television commercials. The clues are obvious and there is little nuance, no style or wit, no music, no suspense and no fun.

Rupert and Lucille Coleman Professor of Christian Theology, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;This delightful study of Jesus Christ the man probes deep and complex truths with a lucid clarity designed for ordinary Christian readers. I&#x2019;m tempted to say that this is Warfield&#x2019;s christology re-written for the devout layperson who wants to understand Jesus better and thereby trust, obey, and love him more whole-heartedly. The discussion questions at the end of each chapter promise that the book will be used widely in churches where one of the passions is to understand historic Christian truth in a fashion that is biblically faithful and spiritually nourishing.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>D.

Carson,</strong>&nbsp;Emeritus Professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School; Cofounder, The Gospel Coalition</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;Marvel and wonder and worship.&#x2019; Bruce Ware rightly suggests that this is the appropriate response as we consider the implications of the humanity of Christ. My heart has been deeply stirred through reading this book and contemplating this oft-overlooked but vital aspect of our Savior.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Nancy DeMoss Wolgemuth,</strong> author, <em>Adorned</em>; Teacher and Host, <em>Revive Our Hearts</em></p><p>&#x201c;Evangelicals who believe the Scriptures to be God&#x2019;s inerrant Word run the risk of emphasizing the deity of the Lord Jesus and, quite unintentionally no doubt, deemphasizing his humanity. Bruce Ware provides a healthy antidote to this malady. This is a welcome addition to the study of christology and one that will aid in our understanding of and love for the man Christ Jesus&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Daniel L. Akin,</strong> President, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;In far too many instances, the church is functionally docetic, basically affirming that the divine Christ only seemed to be human. But as Bruce Ware skillfully and passionately explains, the gospel and its implications depend upon the full deity and true humanity of Jesus Christ. Biblically faithful, theologically solid, devotionally heartwarming, The Man Christ Jesus will increase your knowledge of and reverence for our wonderful Savior and Lord, the God-man Jesus Christ.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Todd L. Miles</strong>, Assistant Professor of Theology, Western Seminary, Portland, Oregon</p><p>&#x201c;Many arguments have been developed and many books have been written in defense of the full deity of the Son of God. As for arguments and writings in support of the full humanity of the Son incarnate, less attention has been given. Bruce Ware corrects this imbalance by offering a treatment that is thoroughly biblical, readable, in tune with contemporary issues, and immensely practical. As readers make their way through this book, they will not only become convinced of the humanity of the God-man and understand why the incarnation was needed; they will also be prompted to offer praise and thanksgiving to God for his wonderful work of salvation through Jesus Christ!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Gregg R.

Kassian,</strong>&nbsp;author, <em>Girls Gone Wise</em></p><p>&#x201c;The proper understanding of Christ&#x2019;s humanity is absolutely essential to understanding our calling and ministry.

Because of this, I highly commend this book to you!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Dann Spader, </strong>President, Global Youth Initiative; Founder, Sonlife Ministries; author, <em>Walking as Jesus Walked</em> and <em>The Everyday Commission</em></p><p>&#x201c;Ever since the church confronted Gnosticism, the reality and necessity of Christ&#x2019;s humanity has been at the heart of Christian orthodoxy. Bruce Ware&#x2019;s grasp and exposition of this essential doctrine contains a rigorous theological precision, communicates an attractive piety, presses the reader to investigate just how central this is to the entire spectrum of the redemptive work of the Messiah, and opens the doctrine to some thick and provocative applicatory ideas. Both ancient and right up to date, Ware&#x2019;s treatment deserves a serious reading.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Tom J.

In their inquisitive explorations and direct language, Jane Kenyon&#x2019;s poems disclose a quiet certainty in the natural world and a lifelong dialogue with her faith and her questioning of it. As a crucial aspect of these beloved poems of companionship, she confronts her struggle with severe depression on its own stark terms. Selected by Kenyon&#x2019;s husband, Donald Hall, just before his death in 2018, <i>The Best Poems of Jane Kenyon</i> collects work from across a life and career that will be, as she writes in one poem, &#x201c;simply lasting.&#x201d;</p></p><p><b>Jane Kenyon</b> (1947&#x2013;1995) published four collections of poetry during her lifetime: <i>From Room to Room</i>, <i>The Boat of Quiet Hours</i>, <i>Let Evening Come</i>, and <i>Constance</i>.

Surprised, if not dismayed, to discover from his superior that leaks are emanating from the <i>Questura</i>, Commissario Guido Brunetti is surprised more consequentially by the appearance of a friend of his wife&#x2019;s, fearful that her son is using drugs and hopeful Brunetti can somehow intervene. When the woman&#x2019;s husband is found unconscious with a serious brain injury at the foot of a bridge in Venice after midnight, Brunetti is drawn to pursue a possible connection to the boy&#x2019;s behavior. But the truth, as Brunetti has experienced so often, is not so straightforward.</p><p><b>Donna Leon</b> is the author of the highly acclaimed, internationally bestselling Commissario Guido Brunetti mystery series. The winner of the CWA Macallan Silver Dagger for Fiction, among other awards, Donna Leon lived in Venice for many years and now divides her time between Venice and Switzerland.When they were seated, Patta began: &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to speak to you frankly, Commissario.&#x201d; Brunetti ignored the chance this remark gave him to ask how Patta had spoken to him in the past and, instead, nodded and put on a pleasant, interested expression. At least Patta had wasted no time with preliminaries.<br> <br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about leaks,&#x201d; Patta said.<br> <br> &#x201c;Leaks?&#x201d; Brunetti asked, resisting the urge to look at the ceiling.<br> <br> &#x201c;From the Questura,&#x201d; Patta continued.<br> <br> Ah, that kind of leaks, Brunetti told himself and wondered what Patta had in mind. Nothing embarrassing had appeared in either <i>Il Gazzettino</i> or <i>La Nuova di Venezia</i> for some time, so Brunetti was without advance warning about what information might be leaking from the Questura.<br> <br> &#x201c;These leaks, sir: could you tell me more about them?&#x201d;<br> <br> &#x201c;I wanted to speak to you, Brunetti, because you know people here,&#x201d; Patta said, reminding Brunetti that this was still the old Patta, for whom any information about the inner workings of the Questura was to be treated as part of the Delphic Mysteries.<br> <br> Brunetti waved a hand in the air, either to dismiss those hidden truths Patta believed he knew or perhaps to summon them from the vasty deep.<br> <br> &#x201c;They talk to you,&#x201d; Patta insinuated. Hearing Patta&#x2019;s suspicion relaxed Brunetti and told him that, though the subject might be new, the old, adversarial order had been restored. He tossed away his momentary warming towards Patta and returned to his native good sense.<br> <br> &#x201c;What is it you think they&#x2019;ve been talking about Vice-Questore?&#x201d;<br> <br> Patta cleared his throat with a small noise. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard rumors that some people are displeased with Lieutenant Scarpa,&#x201d; Patta said, struggling, it seemed, to keep indignation from his voice. Then, more calmly, as though he considered it of lesser importance, he added, &#x201c;It also seems that someone has been talking about a person brought in for questioning.&#x201d;</p><h2>Friendshape</h2><p>The bestselling creators of EXCLAMATION MARK! introduce a triangle, circle, square, and rectangle who celebrate the gift of friendship.<br><br>Friends shape who we are.

Rabbit! (Chronicle, 2009). Using shapes as personified characters, the text explores axioms about friendship. With expressive eyes and mouths, a digitally colored red rectangle, green triangle, yellow square, and blue circle pose on spreads to illustrate concepts like "Friends make you feel at home." For this, the quartet poses with rectangle as a red carpet, square atop triangle to create a house shape, and circle rolling toward them with a grin. Each axiom in large black print is complemented by the characters' conversations, as when rectangle thanks triangle for his literal support for "Friends are always there for you to lean on." The finale shows them lined up vertically, rectangle-circle-triangle-square, to represent the word love. VERDICT This is a winning introduction to simple shapes and colors as well as a pleasing choice for children who will relate to the emotions and appreciate the visual puns.&#x2014;Gay Lynn Van Vleck, Henrico County Library, Glen Allen, VA</p><h2>Words for War: New Poems from Ukraine (Ukrainian Studies)</h2><p>The armed conflict in the east of Ukraine brought about an emergence of a distinctive trend in contemporary Ukrainian poetry: the poetry of war. Directly and indirectly, the poems collected in this volume engage with the events and experiences of war, reflecting on the themes of alienation, loss, dislocation, and disability; as well as justice, heroism, courage, resilience, generosity, and forgiveness. In addressing these themes, the poems also raise questions about art, politics, citizenship, and moral responsibility. The anthology brings together some of the most compelling poetic voices from different regions of Ukraine. Young and old, female and male, somber and ironic, tragic and playful, filled with extraordinary terror and ordinary human delights, the voices recreate the human sounds of war in its tragic complexity.</p><p>Oksana Maksymchuk is an author of two award-winning books of poetry in the Ukrainian language, and a recipient of Richmond Lattimore and Joseph Brodsky-Stephen Spender translation prizes. She works on problems of cognition and motivation in Plato&#x2019;s moral psychology. Maksymchuk teaches philosophy at the University of Arkansas. Max Rosochinsky is a poet and translator from Simferopol, Crimea. His poems had been nominated for the PEN International New Voices Award in 2015. With Maksymchuk, he won first place in the 2014 Brodsky-Spender competition. His academic work focuses on twentieth century Russian poetry, especially Osip Mandelshtam and Marina Tsvetaeva.&#x201c;In this powerful new anthology a number of emerging and established Ukrainian voices chart what it means to be in a state of war, and how it affects the poetics of a country. They represent a flourishing and important poetic identity, and a body of work on war equal to anything in the current global canon of war poetry. However the poems here also have a political urgency. An unacknowledged war has been going on between Russia and Ukraine for several years now, and the level of misinformation and propaganda is now extreme. The poems published in <i>Words for War</i> are not just things of beauty and truth, but essential information in an age of fake news.&#x201d; &#x2015;Sasha Dugdale, editor of <i>Modern Poetry in Translation</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Words for War: New Poems from Ukraine</i> is an urgent, beautiful and astonishing collection of poems. Read this book to remember, as Kateryna Kalytko writes, that &#x2018;Loneliness could have a name,&#x2019; and, as Vasyl Holoborodko writes, that there is an invisible history in every series of footsteps. How may we remember our humanity? &#x2018;I&#x2019;m gathering my footsteps / so that strangers don&#x2019;t trample them.&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x2015;Laynie Browne, author of <i>P R A C T I C E</i><br><br>&#x201c;Poets standing on a small patch of ground between life and death; this is one of the most important anthologies of our time! Many thanks to the poets, editors and translators, bringing urgency to the forefront! These are poets who remind us we are of one world and we need to meet them there!&#x201d; &#x2015;CAConrad, author of <i>While Standing in Line for Death</i><br><br>&#x201c;Poems are frequently described as &#x2018;powerful,&#x2019; violence as &#x2018;unspeakable&#x2019; or &#x2018;senseless.&#x2019; We all have heard that the pen is mightier than the sword. Most of the time, however, we cannot fathom the meaning of these turns of phrase. In <i>Words for War</i>, they gain weight and significance, coming from the midst of the conflict that has engulfed Ukraine since 2014. For all the darkness and pain of many of these poems, translated from both Russian and Ukrainian, they attest to an optimism that literature can speak back to violence, can find its sense, that language will prevail over the cynical political interests that have engineered this needless bloodshed. Rendered into English by a superb international team of translators, with moving introductory and concluding essays, this volume is the best account of the war in Ukraine I have read.&#x201d; &#x2015;Kevin M. Platt, Professor of Russian and East European Studies, University of Pennsylvania, and the editor and translator of <i>Hit Parade: The ORBITA Group</i> (2015)<br><br>&#x201c;How much Ukraine has suffered, we cannot count, and so we often forget. A battleground for empires, torn apart from inside and out, as far back as it can remember. War has been waged over and through it and when it tired, hunger, ethnic strife, political repressions, corruption, or stagnation took its place. It has had scarcely a night of peace. So the poets in this anthology don&#x2019;t sleep; they keep their poems open 24 hours, awake, which is why&#x2015;as one poet in this anthology writes&#x2015;&#x2018;Poetry witnessed it all.&#x2019; The poets in this collection&#x2015;writing in Ukrainian or in Russian, or questioning the place of their own language&#x2015;move quickly and confidently between straight-faced testimony (a la Charles Reznikoff) and Celan-esque fragmentation; veering and ricocheting between witness and trauma, as if to explode those easy distinctions and catch the blur of history.&#x201d; &#x2015;Matvei Yankelevich, author, <i>Some Worlds for Dr. Vogt</i> (2015)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Words for War </i>is not your conventional poetry of witness but poetry and collective translation as intervention, complicity, weapon, social media fodder, reflection, deflection, defection, defiance, sentiment, mourning, melancholy, anger, black comedy, patriotism, disgust, activism, iPad wet dream, delirium, nightmare, hope, hopelessness, absurdity, combat. Poetry in the service of poetry. Poetry on the front lines.&#x201d; &#x2015;Charles Bernstein, co-editor, <i>Best American Experimental Poetry</i> (2017)<br><br>&#x201c;We necessarily come to these poems in a time of war, and that war&#x2019;s grotesque political dimensions and endless violence are painfully felt on these pages. But these are poems that should command our attention even in a time of peace, should it ever come to our troubled planet: these are poems in which the spirit of creative imagination, free expression, emotional clarity, and ethical courage reigns supreme.&#x201d; &#x2015;Stephanie Sandler, Professor, Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures, Harvard University<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2018;How would you explain the war?&#x2019; asks one of the poems in this collection, but indeed it is the main question of the whole. War, whether seen from up close or far away, crumples the fabric of life. It enters like a pole exerting a pull on every point of daily experience. War turns out be an autonomous mechanism: its causes and reasons fall away, but it abides and expands, self-caused, self-moving, self-creating. It is a machine of such overwhelming reality that in its presence reason and language can either go silent or turn into poetry, which is, after all, a shape of silence. But then what happens? Do we read this collection to &#x2018;learn&#x2019; about war? Do we read it for its existential authenticity? Do we read it as a model of the poetical becoming political? Do we read it to use it for our own ends? Its poets include soldiers, refugees, inhabitants of regions at peace, �migr�s anxiously contemplating the conflict from afar. Some, like Serhiy Zhadan, have achieved international fame, others are more locally known. The skilled translations render originals in Ukrainian and in Russian composed in a variety of styles. The editing gives each poet enough material for us to grasp the individuality of the voice.&#x201d; &#x2015;Eugene Ostashevsky, professor in the Liberal Studies Program at New York University and translator of <i>The Fire Horse: Children&#x2019;s Poems by Vladimir Mayakovsky, Osip Mandelstam, and Daniil Kharms</i> (2017)</p><h2>Caterpillar Summer</h2><p><p><b>This beautifully written, emotional debut perfect for fans of Lynda Mullaly Hunt or Ali Benjamin tells the story a girl, her special needs brother, and the summer they will never forget.</b></p><p><b>"An engaging, honest book." --Kimberly Brubaker Bradley, Newbery Honor-winning author of <i>The War That Saved My Life</i></b></p><p><b>"</b><b>A beautiful story of family, forgiveness, life on an island, and growing up.&#x201d;--Kate Messner, author of <i>Breakout </i>and <i>The Seventh Wish</i></b></p><p>Cat and her brother Chicken have always had a very special bond--Cat is one of the few people who can keep Chicken happy.

She has a younger brother on the autism spectrum, her father died recently, and her mother's artistic temperament is leaving Cat with a lot of responsibility at a young age. Cat is excited to go to Atlanta for the summer so that she can spend time with her best friend and just enjoy being a kid. All this changes when her best friend has a family emergency that takes him to India. Cat finds herself on a small island in North Carolina with grandparents she's never met and she doesn't know the real reason her mom has kept her away from her grandparents. Over the course of the summer, Cat learns to love her mothers's parents. She also learns to let go of some of her feelings of always needing to be there for her brother by allowing others to help. While Caterpillar and her brother are both biracial, this is not a critical component of the plot. Readers may question whether race was a factor in the degeneration of Cat's mother's relationship with her own parents, but this turns out not to be the case. There are minor references to Caterpillar's struggle with her hair and her white mother's inability to style it effectively. The representation in this case is important from the standpoint of biracial visibility. Though this is not an uncommon family structure, it is seen infrequently in middle grade fiction.

Jack Prelutsky, one of the premier children's poets of our time, manages to be deadpan and goofy simultaneously and in perfect rhythm right up to the pleasantly unpredictable punch lines of his poems. <p> Take "Jellyfish Stew." "You're soggy, you're smelly, / you taste like shampoo, / you bog down my belly / with oodles of goo, / yet I would glue noodles / and prunes to my shoe, / for one oozy spoonful / of jellyfish stew." Poems about greedy grannies, exploding Bloders, and hypothetical situations such as having your nose unfortunately situated between your toes are guaranteed to delight you and your favorite kids. Quirky, surprising, and always delightful, Prelutsky's poems make us wish we'd grown up with his books in hand. Illustrator James Stevenson's loose pen-and-ink sketches are lively and fluid, waltzing along perfectly with Prelutsky's playful poetry.

Barber II led more than a hundred thousand people at rallies across North Carolina to protest restrictions to voting access and an extreme makeover of state government. These protests&#x2014;the largest state government&#x2013;focused civil disobedience campaign in American history&#x2014;came to be known as Moral Mondays and have since blossomed in states as diverse as Florida, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Ohio, and New York.<br><br>At a time when divide-and-conquer politics are exacerbating racial strife and economic inequality, Rev. Barber offers an impassioned, historically grounded argument that Moral Mondays are hard evidence of an embryonic Third Reconstruction in America.<br><br>The first Reconstruction briefly flourished after Emancipation, and the second Reconstruction ushered in meaningful progress in the civil rights era. But both were met by ferocious reactionary measures that severely curtailed, and in many cases rolled back, racial and economic progress. This Third Reconstruction is a profoundly moral awakening of justice-loving people united in a fusion coalition powerful enough to reclaim the possibility of democracy&#x2014;even in the face of corporate-financed extremism.<br><br>In this memoir of how Rev. Barber and allies as diverse as progressive Christians, union members, and immigration-rights activists came together to build a coalition, he offers a trenchant analysis of race-based inequality and a hopeful message for a nation grappling with persistent racial and economic injustice. Rev. Barber writes movingly&#x2014;and pragmatically&#x2014;about how he laid the groundwork for a state-by-state movement that unites black, white, and brown, rich and poor, employed and unemployed, gay and straight, documented and undocumented, religious and secular. Only such a diverse fusion movement, Rev. Barber argues, can heal our nation&#x2019;s wounds and produce public policy that is morally defensible, constitutionally consistent, and economically sane. <i>The Third Reconstruction</i> is both a blueprint for movement building and an inspiring call to action from the twenty-first century&#x2019;s most effective grassroots organizer.</p><p><b>The Reverend Dr. William J.

Fully aware of the suspicion Bible-speak arouses in modern progressive circles, the author still insists on viewing the justice struggle through a moral prism, one always backstopped by &#x2018;a Higher Power.&#x2019;...A heartfelt dose of old-time religion mixed with modern-day activism.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>&#x201c;William Barber is the closest person we have to Martin Luther King, Jr. in our midst.

Right now in North Carolina there is a movement that&#x2019;s making history, and it is spreading across the land. This book is the memoir of that movement. On these pages, revival and revolution are friends, Jesus and justice kiss, evangelism and liberation are inseparable partners.

Cone, Charles Augustus Briggs Distinguished Professor of Systematic Theology, Union Theological Seminary<br><br>&#x201c;William J. Barber II is both a pastor and a prophet. <i>The Third Reconstruction</i> is a powerful account of a new movement in North Carolina that is teaching us four things: that ideological extremism which targets the most vulnerable is best countered by a moral movement and not a partisan one, that single issue agendas must flow into integrated visions for social justice and the common good, that multiracial movements are needed to build both racial and economic justice, and that the willingness to sacrifice outside of politics is the best way to change the inside of politics. Rev. Barber also shows us how &#x201c;faith acts&#x201d; can transform political actions. Barber&#x2019;s unquenchable fire for justice shines through every page of this remarkable book. I strongly recommend <i>The Third Reconstruction</i>, which shows how a moral, multiracial, and sacrificial movement can change the future of our democracy.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Jim Wallis, author of <i>The UnCommon Good</i>, president of Sojourners, and editor-in-chief of <i>Sojourners</i> magazine<br><br>&#x201c;Powerful and compelling, this personal and political history of North Carolina&#x2019;s 21st century freedom movement will pull readers to their feet and send them to the streets.

At over six feet tall, with rich auburn hair, clear skin, and a slender waist, he was, to many, "the handsomest prince ever seen." From this starting point in <i>Henry VIII, the King and His Court</i>, biographer extraordinare Alison Weir reveals a Henry VIII far different from the obese, turkey-leg gnawing, womanizing tyrant who has gone down in history. Henry embodied the Renaissance ideal of a man of many talents--musician, composer, linguist, scholar, sportsman, warrior--indeed, the Dutch humanist Erasmus (not a man inclined to flattery) declared him a "universal genius." In scholarly yet readable style, Weir brings Henry and his court to life in meticulous, but never tedious, detail. Weir describes everything from courtly fashions to political factions and elaborate meals to tournament etiquette. Along the way she offers up charming--if all too brief--glimpses of Henry's court: tiny Princess Mary, still a very young girl, at her betrothal ceremony saying to the proxy, "Are you the Dauphin of France? If you are, I want to kiss you"; Henry weeping with joy as he held his long-awaited son and heir for the first time; Henry showing off his legs to the Venetian ambassador ("Look here! I have also a good calf to my leg"); Henry's courtiers dressing in heavily padded clothes to emulate--and flatter--their increasingly stout monarch. She also reveals some surprises, for example, that Henry and Katherine were still hunting together as late as 1530, even though Henry was desperately trying to have their marriage annulled. Weir also describes surprisingly happier times in their relationship; Henry loved to dress up in costume, and "was especially fond of bursting in upon Queen Katherine and her ladies in the Queen's Chambers.... Henry took a boyish delight in these disguisings and Katherine seemingly never tired of feigning astonishment that it was her husband who had surprised her." Henry's queens receive relatively little attention here (for them, see Weir's excellent <i>Six Wives of Henry VIII</i>), but this book is fascinating and a joy to read. Alison Weir has done it again. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i>"WEIR'S BOOK OUTSHINES ALL PREVIOUS STUDIES OF HENRY. Beautifully written, exhaustive in its research, it is a gem. . . .

But Carver began life as a poet, and it might be argued that in their striking rhythms, their almost lyric compression, his stories resemble nothing so much as narrative verse. In <i>All of Us</i>, his collected poems, we find what his widow, Tess Gallagher, calls "the spiritual current out of which he moved to write the short stories." Played out against the quintessential Carver emotional landscapes of loneliness and alcohol and not enough money, these poems seem to contain the seeds of his stories within them, sometimes caught in a single image, line, or idea. Any Carver aficionado will experience shivers of recognition while reading this volume: how the final moments of "My Dad's Wallet" ("our breath coming and going") transmute into the "human noise we sat there making" in "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"; the way the early poem "Distress Sale" resonates in the garage sale of his "Why Don't We Dance." <p> "The poems give themselves as easily and unselfconsciously as breath," Gallagher writes in her introduction, and it's true. But just because they are plainspoken, don't mistake these for the doodles of a fiction writer whiling away the time between stories. Carver's poems have a lyric momentum all their own, never more evident than in his final poems, written months and in some cases just weeks before his death; Carver seems to have broken away from everything but the simplest and most direct forms of expression. This is language burnished to its essentials, heartbreaking in its very clarity. Witness the final words he ever wrote, in "Last Fragment": </p><blockquote> And did you get what<br> you wanted from this life, even so?<br> I did.<br> And what did you want?<br> To call myself beloved, to feel myself<br> beloved on the earth.<br> </blockquote> That much, surely, he did. Carver lived a decade longer than he had any right to expect, lived to give us some of his most powerful work: two of his three books of stories, almost all of these poems. Nearly dead from alcoholism, he was granted a 10-year reprieve--"pure gravy," he calls that time, in one poem--and so were we. <i>--Mary Park</i>"<i>All of Us</i> marks the 10th anniversary of Carver's death [and] makes clear that the lyrical reflections in his poems are as much a part of his formidable legacy as his incomparable stories."<br>--Dan DeLuca<br><i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i><p>"The cumulative effect is exhilarating...all of it infused with a largeness of spirit that adds a new <br>dimension to [our] impression of the man"<br>--James Lasdun<br><i>Times Literary <br>Supplement</i>, London</p></p><h2>The Untouchable</h2><p>One of the most dazzling and adventurous writers now working in English takes on the enigma of the Cambridge spies in a novel of exquisite menace, biting social comedy, and vertiginous moral complexity. The narrator is the elderly Victor Maskell, formerly of British intelligence, for many years art expert to the Queen. Now he has been unmasked as a Russian agent and subjected to a disgrace that is almost a kind of death. But at whose instigation?<br><br>As Maskell retraces his tortuous path from his recruitment at Cambridge to the airless upper regions of the establishment, we discover a figure of manifold doubleness: Irishman and Englishman; husband, father, and lover of men; betrayer and dupe. Beautifully written, filled with convincing fictional portraits of Maskell's co-conspirators, and vibrant with the mysteries of loyalty and identity, <i>The Untouchable</i> places John Banville in the select company of both Conrad and le Carre.<br><br>Winner of the Lannan Literary Award for Fiction<br><br>"Contemporary fiction gets no better than this... Banville's books teem with life and humor." - Patrick McGrath, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br>"Victor Maskell is one of the great characters in recent fiction... <i>The Untouchable</i> is the best work of art in any medium on [its] subject." -<i>Washington Post Book World</i><br>"As remarkable a literary voice as any to come out of Ireland; Joyce and Beckett notwithstanding." -<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></p><p>A brilliant, engaging, and highly literate espionage-cum-existential novel, John Banville's <i>The Untouchable</i> concerns the suddenly-exposed double agent Victor Maskell, a character based on the real Cambridge intellectual elites who famously spied on the United Kingdom in the middle of the 20th century. But Maskell--scholar, adventurer, soldier, art curator, and more--respected and still living in England well past his retirement from espionage, looked like he was going to get away with it when suddenly, in his 70s and sick with cancer, he is unmasked. The question of why, and by whom is not as important for Maskell as the larger question of who finally he himself really is, why he spied in the first place, and whether his many-faceted existence adds up to an authentic life.John Banville was born in Wexford, Ireland, in 1945.&nbsp; He is the author of more than ten novels, including <i>The Book of Evidence,</i> which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and won the Guinness Peat Aviation Award.&nbsp; He won the Booker Prize&nbsp;for his novel <i>The Sea </i>in 2005.&nbsp; He lives in Dublin.</p><h2>Tea at Fortnum &amp; Mason</h2><p><b>A&nbsp;concise yet sumptuous guide presenting everything there is to know about the art of taking tea, from the internationally renowned store in Piccadilly that is synonymous with style, elegance, and English charm</b>&nbsp;Celebrating the long-standing British institution, this beautiful pocket book covers everything from the history of afternoon tea drinking to Fortnum's relationship with tea.&nbsp;It also&nbsp;presents&nbsp;more than&nbsp;45 recipes for all types of teatime delight, as well as guiding the reader through the best types of tea to accompany them.

This history-drenched city on the Adriatic has always tantalized Jan Morris with its moodiness and changeability. After visiting Trieste for more than half a century, she has come to see it as a touchstone for her interests and preoccupations: cities, seas, empires. It has even come to reflect her own life in its loves, disillusionments, and memories. Her meditation on Trieste is characteristically layered with history and glows with stories of famous visitors from James Joyce to Sigmund Freud.<br>A lyrical travelogue, <i>Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere</i> is also superb cultural history and the culmination of a singular career--"an elegant and bittersweet farewell" (<i>Boston Globe</i>).</p><p>Located on a narrow, mountainous finger of Italy hard by Croatia and Slovenia, the port city of Trieste is something of a backwater, little visited and seldom in the news. As Jan Morris, who first came to Trieste as the English soldier James Morris in 1945, writes, "It offers no unforgettable landmark, no universally familiar melody, no unmistakable cuisine, hardly a single native name that anyone knows."<p> Yet, as historian and travel writer Morris ably demonstrates in this homage to one of her favorite cities (others about which she has written are Hong Kong, Sydney, New York, and Venice), Trieste has many charms. Its history is foremost among them, thanks to the city's former role as the sole port of the otherwise landlocked Austro-Hungarian empire, which housed a small fleet there--a fleet that, from time to time, would sail off to make war against the Ottomans or the Italians. At the beginning of the 20th century, Trieste had grown to international importance as an entry point into Central Europe, so much so that it was referred to as "the third entrance of the Suez Canal." Trieste briefly took center stage at the onset of the cold war, when Marshall Tito claimed it for Yugoslavia; it narrowly avoided being enveloped by the Iron Curtain. Morris tells all these stories and more, bringing the city's past to life; no one should be surprised if Trieste sees more visitors thanks to her spirited study.</p><p> Yet <i>Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere</i> is also a work tinged with melancholy. That befits the city's faded glory, but it also has to do with the sad fact that this will be Morris's last book--or so she promises. Let's hope she changes her mind. If not, however, this serves very well as the capstone of a distinguished career. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Jan Morris</b> has written more than thirty books of travel, history, and autobiography, including <i>Manhattan 1945</i> and <i>The World of Venice.</i> Her novel <i>Last Letters from Hav</i> was a finalist for the Booker Prize.

Over two decades of brewing and beer research, he has probed the depths of beer history in both his reading and his brewing. Radical Brewing displays the many unique ales and lagers that have resulted from his celebration of beer while serving as a vehicle for discussing a creative, "outside the lines" approach to modern brewing. Through it all, the reader is treated to Mosher&#x2019;s irresistible love of beer and brewing as well as some very humorous asides on beer history. </p><p>The infectious spirit of homebrewing is hard to resist when one reviews Mosher&#x2019;s recipe for "Electric Aunt Jemima Maple Buckwheat Ale," checks out the section on "(Not so Dumb) Blonde Ales" or chuckles through his fanciful description of the birth of beer featuring the ancient Harl&#x2019;eh-riding Ur&#x2019;s Angels. Best of all, the two-color visually rich content comes in self-contained segments that instantly engage readers no matter what page they turn to. </p><p>Typically, modern brewing books focus on the science of how to brew&#x2014;and Mosher has mastered all of that. But in Radical Brewing, he focuses on the creative, expressive opportunities available to those with a brew kettle. Each chapter offers techniques and recipes as well as ideas for independent exploration of new brewing frontiers. The result is a text that both informs and inspires experienced brewers while providing an engaging and intelligent introduction to the hobby for newcomers. </p><p>Famed beer writer Michael Jackson once called Mosher "some kind of homebrewing genius" and in the forward to Radical Brewing, he further lionizes this genius, saying "His activities are probably a threat to our morals. Passion, imagination and tenacity are a challenge to the established order." These two masters of beer have collaborated in the past, as Jackson notes when he tells how Mosher accurately recreated the flavor of a now-lost beer style that even Jackson had only once tasted himself. And though Jackson&#x2019;s accolades for Mosher are great, one can only imagine that they will pale as practicing brewers of all stripes begin to digest Mosher&#x2019;s treasure-trove of beer ideas and render their own reviews of this delightful book.</p>From the Foreword, The Marvel of Mosher, by Michael Jackson: <p>The world desperately needs more Moshers.

What should Christians make of Genesis 1-3, seemingly at odds with modern scientific accounts? Why does the Old Testament contain so much violence? How should Christians handle texts that give women a second-class status? Does the Old Testament contradict itself? Why are so many Psalms filled with anger and sorrow? What should we make of texts that portray God as filled with wrath?<br><br>Combining pastoral insight, biblical scholarship, and a healthy dose of humility, gifted teacher and communicator Matthew Schlimm explores perennial theological questions raised by the Old Testament. He provides strategies for reading and appropriating these sacred texts, showing how the Old Testament can shape the lives of Christians today and helping them appreciate the Old Testament as a friend in faith.</p><p><b>The Old Testament as a Friend in Faith<br></b><br>"Many of us have waited a long time for this book, a compelling engagement of the toughest questions about the Testament that both attracts and repels us. In plain language, without taking theological shortcuts, Schlimm shows why Christianity needs the Old Testament in order to address the complexities and real difficulties of life. His concrete guidance for how to read this strange literature and his suggestions for further study are invaluable."<br>--<b>Ellen Davis</b>, Duke Divinity School<br><br>"Schlimm adroitly considers many of the thorny issues that puzzle modern people of faith; he is a gifted guide in showing readers that the Old Testament's alien qualities do not render it useless for Christian faith.&nbsp;To the contrary, he reveals how often the Bible's strangeness leads us into deeper understanding of God and of ourselves."<br>--<b>Jacqueline Lapsley</b>, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>"The Old Testament has raised numerous questions for readers through the centuries.&nbsp;And it continues to do so!&nbsp;Matthew Schlimm explores many of these issues, especially those regarding creation, law, gender, images for God, and violence.&nbsp;With matters of biblical authority always in view, he works through these texts carefully and thoughtfully--and with clarity!&nbsp;With pastoral sensitivity, Schlimm provides an excellent case for understanding the Old Testament as our friend and not our enemy."<br>--<b>Terence Fretheim</b>, Luther Seminary<br><br>"Seminary and university Old Testament professors: make sure you have your students read this text. To the reader puzzled by much of what you encounter in the Old Testament: immerse yourself deeply in this book, and you will find much food for thought from an author who has addressed intelligently and provocatively the questions that linger in your mind. Matthew Schlimm: well done, thou good and faithful servant."<br>--<b>Victor P. Hamilton</b>, Asbury University"Some of my friends say strange things and hold strange views, but because they are my friends I can't just dismiss what they say. Having friends who think di!erently from me helps expand my thinking and rescue me from the limitations of my current perspective. I give my friends the benefit of the doubt when they say things that are outrageous. Matthew Schlimm invites us to do the same with the Old Testament, helps us to listen to many of its notoriously outrageous statements, and also shares with us worthwhile insights from other people who are friends with the Old Testament (and from yet other people who would not see themselves as its friends)."--<b>John Goldingay,</b> Fuller Theological Seminary<br>"At a time when many critique and marginalize the Old Testament, Schlimm argues that we need to appreciate it as a friend--a friend who is at once odd, insightful, complicated, controversial, and realistic. He is not willing to give up on the Old Testament or its God. <i>This Strange and Sacred Scripture</i> creatively engages the diffculties that trouble interpreters. While some may disagree with the author at points, this book's tone and presentation invite readers to join the conversation about and with this unique friend we call the Bible."--<b>M.

He lives in Scotland.</p>In Botswana, home to the No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency for the problems of ladies, and others, it is customary&#x2014;one might say <i>very customary</i>&#x2014;to enquire of the people whom you meet whether they have slept well. The answer to that question is almost inevitably that they have indeed slept well, even if they have not, and have spent the night tossing and turning as a result of the nocturnal barking of dogs, the activity of mosquitoes or the prickings of a bad conscience. Of course, mosquitoes may be defeated by nets or sprays, just as dogs may be roundly scolded; a bad conscience, though, is not so easily stifled. If somebody were to invent a spray capable of dealing with an uncomfortable conscience, that person would undoubtedly do rather well&#x2014;but perhaps might not sleep as soundly as before, were he to reflect on the consequences of his invention. Bad consciences, it would appear, are there for a purpose: to make us feel regret over our failings. Should they be silenced, then our entirely human weaknesses, our manifold omissions, would become all the greater&#x2014;and that, as Mma Ramotswe would certainly say, is not a good thing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe was fortunate in having an untroubled con-science, and therefore generally enjoyed undisturbed sleep. It was her habit to take to her bed after a final cup of red bush tea at around ten o&#x2019;clock at night. Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, her husband and by common consent the finest mechanic in all Botswana, would often retire before her, particularly if he had had a tiring day at work. Mechanics in general sleep well, as do many others whose day is taken up with physically demanding labour. So by the time that Mma Ramotswe went to bed, he might already be lost to this world, his breathing deep and regular, his eyes firmly closed to the bedside light that he would leave for his wife to extinguish.<br>&nbsp;<br>She would not take long to go to sleep, drifting off to thoughts of what had happened that day; to images of herself drinking tea in the office or driving her van on an errand; to the picture of Mma Makutsi sitting upright at her desk, her large glasses catching the light as she held forth on some issue or other. Or to some memory of a long time ago, of her father walking down a dusty road, holding her hand and explaining to her about the ways of cattle&#x2014;a subject that he knew so well. When a wise man dies, there is so much history that is lost: that is what they said, and Mma Ramotswe knew it to be true. Her own father, the late Obed Ramotswe, had taken so much with him, but had also left much behind, so many memories and sayings and observations, that she, his daughter, could now call up and cherish as she waited for the soft arms of sleep to embrace her.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe did not remember her dreams for very long once she had woken up. Occasionally, though, an egregiously vivid dream might make such an impression that it lodged in her memory, and that is what happened that morning. It was not in any way a bad dream; nor was it a particularly good dream, the sort of dream that makes one feel as if one has been vouchsafed some great mystical insight; it was, rather, one of those dreams that seems to be a clear warning that something special is about to happen. If a dream involves lottery tickets and numbers, then its meaning is clear enough. This dream was not like that, and yet it left Mma Ramotswe feeling that she had somehow been given advance notice of something out of the ordinary, something important.<br>&nbsp;<br>In this dream she was walking along a path in the stretch of bush immediately behind Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, the building that the No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency shared with Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni&#x2019;s garage. She was not sure where she was going, but this did not seem to matter as Mma Ramotswe felt happy just to be walking along it with no great sense of having to reach a destination. And why should one not walk along a path, particularly a comfortable path, without any idea of getting anywhere?<br>&nbsp;<br>She turned a corner and found herself faced with a large acacia tree, its foliage extending out like the canopy of a commodious umbrella. To dream of trees is to . . . to long for trees, and finding herself under the shade of this tree would have been enough to make the dream a satisfactory one. But there was more to it. Underneath the tree, standing in such a position that the mottled shade of the leaves all but obscured his face, was a tall, well-built man. He now stepped forward, held out a hand and said, &#x201c;I have come at last, Mma Ramotswe.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>And that was the point at which Mma Ramotswe awoke. The encounter with this stranger had not been threatening in any way; there had been nothing in his demeanour that was suggestive of hostility, and she had not felt in the slightest bit anxious. As for what he said, she had simply thought, even if she had not had the time to say it, <i>Yes, it has been a long time.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>For a few minutes after waking, she had lain still in bed, mulling over the dream. Had the man been her father, then the dream would have been easy to understand. She knew that she dreamed of her father from time to time, which was only to be expected, given that not a day went past, not one day, when she did not think of that great and good man, the late Obed Ramotswe. If you think of somebody every day, then you can be sure you will dream of him at night; but it was not him whom she encountered under that acacia tree&#x2014;that was very clear. It was somebody quite different, somebody she sensed was from a long way away. But who could that be? Mma Ramotswe did not really know anybody from a long way away, unless one counted Francistown or Maun, where she knew a number of people. But those towns, although several hundred miles from Gaborone, are both in Botswana, and nowhere in Botswana was the abode of strangers. That was because Botswana, to those who lived there, was home, and familiar, and comfortable, and no place in such a country will seem far away. No, this man under the tree was from somewhere outside the country, and that was unusual and puzzling and would have to be thought about at some length.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I had a very unusual dream,&#x201d; she said to Mma Makutsi as they attended to the morning&#x2019;s mail in the office.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi looked up from the envelope that she was in the process of slitting open. &#x201c;Dreams are always unusual,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;In fact, it is unusual to have a usual dream.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe frowned. She thought that she understood what Mma Makutsi meant but was not quite sure. Her assistant had a habit of making enigmatic remarks, and this, she suspected, was one such remark.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Phuti,&#x201d; Mma Makutsi continued, referring to her new husband, Phuti Radiphuti, &#x201c;Phuti has many dreams, every night. He tells me about them and I explain what they mean.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;He often dreams about furniture.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That is because he has a furniture shop,&#x201d; Mma Ramotswe said. &#x201c;So perhaps it is not surprising.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That is so, Mma,&#x201d; agreed Mma Makutsi. &#x201c;But he can dream about different pieces of furniture.&#x201d; She paused, fixing Mma Ramotswe on the other side of the room with the cautious look of one about to reveal sensitive information. She lowered her voice. &#x201c;Some nights he dreams about beds; other nights he dreams about dining room tables. It is very strange.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe looked down at her desk. She did not like to discuss the intimate side of anybody&#x2019;s marriage&#x2014;particularly when the marriage was as recent as Mma Makutsi&#x2019;s. She thought of new marriages as being rather like those shy, delicate flowers one sees on the edge of the Kalahari; so small that one might miss them altogether, so vulnerable that a careless step might crush their beauty. Of course, people talked about their dreams without too much embarrassment&#x2014;most dreams, after all, sound inconsequential and silly in the cold light of day&#x2014;but it was different when a wife talked about a husband&#x2019;s dreams, or a husband about a wife&#x2019;s. Dreams occurred in beds, and what occurred in marital beds was not a subject for debate in the office&#x2014;especially if the dream <i>related to </i>beds, as it appeared that some of Phuti Radiphuti&#x2019;s dreams did.<br>&nbsp;<br>But if Mma Ramotswe was reluctant to probe Phuti&#x2019;s dreams too closely, the same was not true of her assistant. The topic had now been broached, and Mma Makutsi pursued it enthusiastically.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;There is no doubt about a dream about beds,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;The meaning of that dream is very clear, Mma. It should be very obvious, even to a person who does not know much about dreams, or other things, for that matter.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe said nothing.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Mma Makutsi, &#x201c;if a person says <i>I have been dreaming about beds, </i>then you know straight away what the dream means. You can say to them, <i>I know what that dream means. It is very clear.</i>&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe looked out of the window, which was high, and gave a view from that angle only of a slice of blue; empty blue; blue with no white of cloud; nothingness. &#x201c;Is the meaning of dreams clear, Mma? Do any dreams make sense, or are they just like . . . like clouds in the sky, composed of nothing very much? Maybe they are clouds in our mind, Mma; maybe that is what they are.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi was having none of this. &#x201c;The meaning is often clear,&#x201d; she retorted. &#x201c;I have no difficulty, Mma, in understanding a dream about beds.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe sighed. &#x201c;Well, they do say, don&#x2019;t they, Mma, that men have such things on their minds most of the time. They say that men think only of that, all day. Listen to the way Charlie speaks when he thinks you can&#x2019;t hear him. That shows you what men think about&#x2014;or at least, young men. I do not think that Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni has thoughts like that in his head all day. I do not think that, Mma.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>It was as if Mma Makutsi had not heard her. &#x201c;Yes, Mma. The meaning of a dream about beds is very simple. It means that you are tired. It means that you need more sleep.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe stared at her assistant for a few moments. Then, with some degree of relief, she smiled. &#x201c;Well, there you have it, Mma. That must be what such a dream means.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;On the other hand,&#x201d; went on Mma Makutsi, &#x201c;a dream about a dining-room table is different. That does not mean that you are tired.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No, it does not mean that, Mma. A dream about a dining-room table means that you are hungry. I think that is very obvious.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe looked first at the teapot, and then at the clock. She would wait, she decided; if one kept bringing forward the time at which one had tea, then the period after teatime would become far too long. Tea had to be taken at the right time; if anything was clear, it was that.<br>&nbsp;<br>She decided to steer the conversation back to her own dream. But just as she was about to do so, Mma Makutsi came up with a further observation on Phuti&#x2019;s dreams. &#x201c;When he said to me one morning that he had dreamed of dining-room tables, I was worried. Was I giving him enough to eat, I wondered?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And what did you decide, Mma?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m giving him enough food. I believe in demand feeding. I think that is what it&#x2019;s called. I always leave some food out in the kitchen so that Phuti can pick up a snack if he feels hungry. There are other women who believe that you should only feed your husband at set times, so that he gets used to it. But I am not one of those women, Mma. I leave food out.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe suppressed a grin at the thought of demand feeding for husbands. The conversation, although potentially sensitive, had proved to be more amusing than anything else, and she knew that it could drift on indefinitely. It was her own dream that had started it, and it was to her dream that she now returned.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I had a very strange dream last night, Mma,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;As I was saying.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Please tell me what it was, Mma,&#x201d; said Mma Makutsi. &#x201c;I cannot guarantee that I will be able to tell you what it means, but we shall see.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I dreamed that I was walking along a path,&#x201d; Mma Ramotswe began. &#x201c;And&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi interrupted her. &#x201c;That means you are going on a journey, Mma. There can be no doubt about that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe acknowledged this. &#x201c;Possibly. But then the path came to a place&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That is your destination,&#x201d; announced Mma Makutsi. &#x201c;Thatplace that you saw in your dream was your destination in life. That is very clear indeed. What was it like, Mma? Was it a very good place?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;There was an acacia tree&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Again there was an interjection. &#x201c;Then that means you are going to end up under a tree, Mma. That is where you will find yourself, under a tree.&#x201d; She looked at Mma Ramotswe sympathetically.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That is not too bad, Mma. There are many worse places to end up.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But the tree was not all that important,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe, raising her voice slightly to prevent further interruption. &#x201c;There was a man standing under the tree. It was as if he was waiting for me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That will be Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Ramotswe shook her head. &#x201c;It was not him. It was a man I had never seen before. And he did not come from here. He was a stranger.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi&#x2019;s glasses flashed in a slanting band of sunlight. &#x201c;Not from Gaborone?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Not from Botswana?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No. He was from somewhere else. He was not an African at all.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi was silent. Then she delivered her judgement. &#x201c;You are going to meet a stranger,&#x201d; she said, with an air of gravity. &#x201c;You are going to meet a stranger under an acacia tree.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I thought it might mean something like that,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;But then I thought that it probably didn&#x2019;t mean anything at all. That it was just a dream, and I would forget about it by this afternoon.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mma Makutsi looked doubtful. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you should forget it, Mma Ramotswe. I think that you should remember it, so that when it happens, when you meet that stranger under the acacia tree, you will be prepared.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She said nothing more, but gave Mma Ramotswe an oblique look; a look that Mma Ramotswe interpreted as a warning. But she had not understood&#x2014;for all her claims to understanding dreams, Mma Makutsi had missed the point. This stranger was not threatening; this stranger, for whom Mma Makutsi said she should be prepared, was not somebody to be dreaded or guarded against. On the contrary, this stranger was a good man, a kind man, and his arrival&#x2014;if he were ever to come, which was highly unlikely&#x2014;was something to be welcomed, something to be celebrated. And there was something else&#x2014;something that was hard to put into words. The man in the dream might have been a stranger in that she had never seen him before, but somehow she felt that she knew him. <i>She knew him but did not know him.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>She glanced at her watch again. Resolve can be weakened by time, and by talk about dreams and by heat.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s a bit early, but I think that we should have tea now,&#x201d; she said to Mma Makutsi. And Mma Makutsi, who had removed her glasses to clean them, looked up, finished her task of polishing the lenses and said that she completely agreed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;On a hot day,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;we dream of tea.&#x201d;</p><h2>Do You Want to Start a Scandal (Castles Ever After)</h2><p><b>All Charlotte wanted was to avoid scandal.

It now reappears, in response to many requests, to play its part in the hardly less urgent food-production drive of peacetime. Everything that the small-scale raiser of rabbits or of poultry, whether for egg-production or for table use, needs to know is here: buying, housing, feeding, breeding, diseases, are all fully dealt with by experts, the instructions being given in simple and practical language for the beginner. Keeping Poultry and Rabbits on Scraps was originally reissued after the war, in 1949. Here it is once again, a facsimilie edition with all the delightful original illustrations and advice to keep your chickens and rabbits happy, whether they be in a city garden or roaming in a farm yard.</p><p>Alan Thompson, author of the poultry section of this book, kept poultry from the moment he left school. He obtained his technical knowledge at Harper Adams College and was Editor of the Poultry Farmer for 15 years. He also farmed livestock in Copthorne, Sussex, and his voice was familiar to all those who listened to the BBC poultry talks. Claude Goodchild, author of the rabbit section, spent the first 35 years of his life on an Essex farm and bred rabbits on a considerable scale from the age of 15. He later went on to run the largest rabbit farm of its time in England at Black Corner, near Crawley, Sussex. He started the Rex rabbit in England, was among the first to breed Chinchillas and visited Russia in an advisory capacity at the invitation of the Soviet Government.</p><h2>8 Keys to Safe Trauma Recovery: Take-Charge Strategies to Empower Your Healing (8 Keys to Mental Health)</h2><p><p><strong>Safe and effective principles and strategies for recovery from trauma.</strong></p> Trauma recovery is tricky; however, there are several key principles that can help make the process safe and effective.

Each volume is designed by the award-winning cartoonist Seth (<i>Clyde Fans</i>) and features impeccable production values; every single strip from Charles M. Schulz's 50-year American classic is reproduced better than ever before. This volume includes an introduction by Matt Groening (<i>The Simpsons</i>) as well as the popular <i>Complete Peanuts</i> index, a hit with librarians and collectors alike, and an epilogue by series editor Gary Groth. <br></p><p>In 1955-56, the Peanuts gang may have still been in first grade (or lower), but the characters continue to grow into their distinctive and unmistakable personalities. Snoopy overcomes some embarrassment to reveal his talent for impressions (wolf, rhino, alligator, kangaroo, Violet, etc.) and his joyous dance-the-day-away attitude. Linus adopts the same attitude ("Five hundred years from now, who'll know the difference?") and continues to show his genius in such diverse activities as square balloons, snow sculptures, and air sketches, even though he has to resort to wishful violence against his bullying sister. Lucy, now a ripe old 4, has to face such concerns as the Earth being worn down by people's feet and whether Santa exists. And already concerned about getting married, she tries to divert Schroeder's attention from Beethoven either by logic (what's the sense in learning Beethoven sonatas if you don't win a prize?), by sympathy ("My favorite piece is Bach's Toccata and Fugue in Asia Minor"), or by violence, and pulls away the football from Charlie Brown for the first time (December 1956). She also teaches her brother "little-known facts" about the world (palm trees were so named because people can fit their hand around them), which gives Charlie Brown stomach aches and formed part of the stage musical <i>You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown</i>. But she'll never lose an argument as long as she can end it with a well-placed insult. Such is the misery of Charlie Brown, who also has to endure his failure to fly a kite, his complete failure on the baseball diamond, and misery during any holiday. That he does endure, however, makes him one of the heroes of our time. The third volume of Fantagraphics Books' handsome <i>Complete Peanuts</i> series includes a foreword by Matt Groening and a Charles M. Schulz retrospective by Gary Groth. <i>--David Horiuchi</i><p><strong>Charles M. Schulz</strong> was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip <em>Barney Google</em>).<br><br> In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 <em>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</em> installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>&#x2015;as well as, to the local <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press</em>, a weekly comic feature called <em>Li'l Folks</em>. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.<br><br> He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, <em>Li'l Folks</em>. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become <em>Peanuts</em>&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first <em>Peanuts</em> daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.<br><br> Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from <em>Peanuts</em> at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.</p><p><strong>Matt Groening</strong> (b. 1954) is an Emmy Award-winner, best known for co-creating animated TV series such as <em>The Simpsons</em>&nbsp; and <em>Futurama</em>. He also cartooned a long-running alt-weekly strip called <em>Life In Hell</em>, for which he won a Rueben.</p></p><h2>Fire from Heaven: A Novel of Alexander the Great</h2><p>Alexander&#x2019;s beauty, strength, and defiance were apparent from birth, but his boyhood honed those gifts into the makings of a king.

Here we see the system through the eyes of the men and women who experience it, not only in the courtroom but in the lockup, the jury room, the judge's chambers, the spectators' gallery. From the daily grind of the court to the highest-profile case of the year, Steve Bogira&#x2019;s masterful investigation raises fundamental issues of race, civil rights, and justice in America.</p><p>Steve Bogira graduated from Northwestern University and has been a prizewinning writer for the Chicago Reader since 1981. He is a former Alicia Patterson Fellow. He lives with his wife in Evanston, Illinois.Every day, Chicago police wagons swing onto the grounds of the Cook County Criminal Courthouse and deposit their cargo at a rear door.<br><br>The prisoners being unloaded on this particular evening&#x2014;January 20, 1998&#x2014;are here for the usual reasons. They sold cocaine rocks on a corner, until an unmarked car screeched up out of nowhere. They tried to buy heroin from an undercover cop. They pocketed a fifth of booze at a grocery and failed to outrun the security guard. They relieved a pickup truck of its tools and a nosy neighbor called 911.<br><br>At the district station, they pulled off their belts and pulled out their laces. They emptied their pockets of combs, cigarettes, matchbooks. They pressed their fingers onto the ink pad, frowned for the camera, and joined the rest of the day&#x2019;s catch in a frigid lockup. They curled up on a metal bench or a concrete floor and waited&#x2014;midnight, four in the morning, noon&#x2014;while computers checked their prints for outstanding warrants. They were treated to a baloney-on-white and coffee in a Styrofoam cup. Those with misdemeanor charges and no warrants were given a court date and released. The others were cuffed wrist to wrist and loaded into the large police wagon that swung by the station. The chain of prisoners in the wagon lengthened as the driver made pickups at other stations. The wagon bumped along toward the courthouse at 26th and California.<br><br>The Cook County Criminal Courthouse&#x2014;the biggest and busiest felony courthouse in the nation&#x2014;sits in a Mexican neighborhood on Chicago&#x2019;s southwest side. It&#x2019;s a boxy limestone structure, seven stories high and seven decades old, with Doric columns, Latin phrases carved into the limestone, and eight sculpted figures above the columns, representing law, justice, liberty, truth, might, love, wisdom, and peace. None of them is visible from the back of a police wagon.<br><br>A paunchy, balding white officer is behind the wheel of the first wagon to dip down a ramp and dock at the rear door this evening. He opens the wagon&#x2019;s tail, and a chain of fifteen men, a dozen black and three white, winds its way out. The prisoners are rumpled and rank&#x2013;the wagon-tossed, wretched refuse of a major American city, arrested on Martin Luther King Day. The driver follows the prisoners to the door, balancing over one shoulder a clear bag holding fifteen smaller clear bags that contain keys, combs, lip salve, cigarettes, lighters, beepers, eyeglasses, belts, shoelaces. In his other hand is a sheaf of arrest reports and rap sheets.<br><br>A navy-shirted sheriff &#x2019;s deputy slides open the barred door, and the prisoners file into the courthouse basement. About fifteen hundred prisoners pass through this doorway weekly on their way to a bond hearing&#x2014;78,000 men and women a year accused of violating the peace and dignity of the State of Illinois.<br><br>In thirty courtrooms on floors two through seven, plea deals are fashioned and hearings and trials conducted every weekday. But for most defendants, the first glimpse of the interior of the courthouse is of this cellar.<br><br>The cellar holds several dank chambers with cinder-block walls and metal benches bolted to concrete floors. The grimy walls have been decorated here and there by deputies who had a black marker or a tube of Preparation H and time on their hands. WELCOME TO COUNTY&#x2014;GET SERVED WITH A SMILE reads the script next to a horned and goateed grinning devil on a wall near the entrance. Other greetings: THIS WAY TO THE DANCE, and HEAD FIRST&#x2014;HIT HERE, and YOU WON'T BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS.<br><br>Later tonight the prisoners will be escorted through a tunnel to the quivering elevator that will carry them up to Courtroom 100 for their bond hearings. At evening&#x2019;s end the lucky prisoners who can make bond or who get an &#x201c;I-bond&#x201d; (a no-money-down individual-recognizance bond) will walk out of the courthouse&#x2019;s front door. The rest of the prisoners&#x2014;about two-thirds of them, if this is a typical night&#x2014;will ride the elevator back downstairs and march through a longer tunnel to jail.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, fifteen desperate criminals,&#x201d; the paunchy officer tells the deputy at the entrance, one of twenty deputies working in the basement this evening. Yawning, the officer hands over the property bag and the paperwork.<br><br>The prisoners are directed to a bench in a bullpen down the hall, where they stand as they&#x2019;re told&#x2014;silently, backs of their legs against the edge of the bench. A second police officer is already at the door, dropping off three bleary-eyed black women. A deputy points them to a nearby bench. They step warily past Blackjack, a German shepherd, and Harley, a Rottweiler, the dogs straining toward them, tugging on the leashes gripped by two deputies.<br><br>Meanwhile a deputy in the bullpen at the end of the hall makes his way down the line of fifteen men, unlocking and collecting the handcuffs for the first wagon driver.<br><br>&#x201c;When the cuffs come off, your hands go behind your back,&#x201d; snaps the bull-necked, light-skinned African American deputy who&#x2019;s got the paperwork now. &#x201c;All right, when you hear your last name, tell me your first name. Powell.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Here.&#x201d;<br><br>Bullneck stalks over to Powell, a frail black youth in a neon-orange windbreaker. &#x201c;Is your first name <i>Here, </i>motherfucker?&#x201d; the deputy hollers in the startled youth&#x2019;s face.<br><br>The prisoners make it through the rest of roll call flawlessly, and then Bullneck directs them to sit. Another wagon arrives, and ten more disheveled males join the first fifteen in the back room. After they&#x2019;re uncuffed and checked in and have taken their seats on one of the benches that line three sides of the chamber, Bullneck welcomes them all to 26th Street.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t scare me,&#x201d; he tells them. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t intimidate me. And you sure fucking don&#x2019;t impress me.&#x201d; He informs the prisoners that they&#x2019;ll be going to bond court, and that after that they&#x2019;ll be headed home or to jail. But there&#x2019;s a third place they can end up if they don&#x2019;t follow the rules here, Bullneck warns&#x2014;the jail hospital.<br><br>The rules are simple and not to be questioned, he says&#x2014;no food, no phone calls, no smoking. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care if you haven&#x2019;t eaten all week or made a phone call all day. It&#x2019;s not my problem.&#x201d; And the cardinal rule: in the hallways, on the elevator, in the courtroom upstairs, a prisoner&#x2019;s hands must remain behind his back. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know you. We don&#x2019;t know what the fuck is on your mind. You come out with your hands swinging, you&#x2019;re gonna get dropped,&#x201d; Bullneck says. &#x201c;If you forget every other rule I tell you, don&#x2019;t forget the hands-behind-the-back rule.&#x201d;<br><br>Bullneck surveys his mute, expressionless subjects.<br><br>&#x201c;Does everybody understand the fucking rules?&#x201d;<br><br>A handful of mumbled <i>yessir</i>s<i>.<br><br></i>&#x201c;Let me hear that <i>again.</i>&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes <i>sir</i>!&#x201d;<br><br>Next Bullneck announces &#x201c;freebie time,&#x201d; inviting the prisoners to surrender any drugs they&#x2019;ve managed to retain despite earlier searches by Chicago police. Nobody gets charged for what they give up now, he promises. But those who think they can sneak something by the deputies should know that Blackjack and Harley will be along presently. And if those dogs sniff a rock, a pinch of blow, or a roach, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re gonna get bit, and you&#x2019;re gonna get charged.&#x201d; As usual, no one takes advantage of freebie time.<br><br>Now Bullneck has the men remove their coats and jackets and toss them onto the floor in the middle of the room. Four deputies wearing black gloves work through the heap of sports team jackets and Salvation Army specials, exploring pockets and kneading collars and waistbands. Meanwhile Bullneck directs the prisoners to pull off their laceless sneakers or workboots, tear out any liners, and hold the shoes upside down by the toes, arms outstretched. The men dutifully comply, and in a moment a ring of stocking-footed men are wordlessly offering up their soles to him.<br><br>&#x201c;And when I tell you to, don&#x2019;t bang &#x2019;em like a buncha pussies,&#x201d; Bullneck says. &#x201c;Bang &#x2019;em so anything inside falls out.&#x201d; He studies the group; all eyes are on him.<br><br>&#x201c;Now&#x2014;<i>bang </i>&#x2019;em!&#x201d;<br><br>A host of arms are immediately pumping, <i>beating </i>those shoes and boots together, admirably unpussylike, the stampede echoing off the walls for a quarter of a minute, until Bullneck raises a hand. Nothing but lint has fallen to the concrete.<br><br>Next he has the men peel off their socks, extend their legs in front of them, and shake their socks while wiggling their toes. A yeasty odor rises in the room.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, everybody stand up!&#x201d; Bullneck bellows. &#x201c;Turn around, grab some wall!&#x201d; The four gloved deputies commence the pat-downs. It&#x2019;s not a penetrating search: anyone willing to tuck a cocaine rock up his butt will get away with it for now, but those who end up going to jail had better smoke up that rock in the jail bullpens before the strip-search there. Blackjack and Harley are mainly showpieces, Bullneck&#x2019;s warning about the dogs&#x2019; impending sniff-search an empty threat. The deputies are checking for weapons now more than drugs. They don&#x2019;t trust the pat-downs of Chicago&#x2019;s finest; prisoners have arrived here with knives in their pockets, the deputies claim. (Chicago cops &#x201c;couldn&#x2019;t find their ass with both hands,&#x201d; one deputy says.)<br><br>A skinny Hispanic man awaiting his search foolishly peeks over his shoulder. The boss here tonight, the white-shirted Sergeant London Thomas, who&#x2019;s been watching the pat-downs from just outside the bullpen, is at the skinny man&#x2019;s side in an instant. &#x201c;What the <i>fuck</i>&#x2019;re you staring at <i>me </i>for?&#x201d; Thomas roars in the man&#x2019;s ear. &#x201c;Face the fucking wall!<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Everybody </i>should be staring at the wall,&#x201d; Thomas growls. &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t nothing behind you but an ass-kicking."<br><br>&#x201c;This guy&#x2019;s got a ring on that don&#x2019;t come off,&#x201d; a deputy says. &#x201c;Guess we&#x2019;ll just have to lop off a finger.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s with you?&#x201d; asks another deputy, of the trembling middle-aged man he&#x2019;s searching.<br><br>&#x201c;I have MS,&#x201d; the man mumbles.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, he has <i>PMS,</i>&#x201d; the deputy announces, to his comrades&#x2019; snickers.<br><br>There&#x2019;s a method to the deputies&#x2019; malice, Sergeant Thomas says later: it&#x2019;s to let the prisoners know immediately who&#x2019;s in charge in the courthouse. &#x201c;Control is something we cannot relinquish,&#x201d; the sergeant says. &#x201c;If we did that, we&#x2019;d be fucked up right away. Extremely.&#x201d; The twenty or so deputies who work a bond court shift are watching at least sixty and sometimes more than a hundred prisoners. The deputies carry no weapons, to eliminate the risk of a prisoner seizing one. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re armed with gloves, handcuffs, and attitude,&#x201d; Thomas says.<br><br>But the deputies&#x2019; tone also expresses their sentiments about the prisoners. Those marched into the basement are cloaked in the presumption of innocence&#x2014;in theory. The prevailing wisdom down here, however, is: if they&#x2019;re so innocent, why&#x2019;d they arrive in handcuffs?<br><br>&#x201c;We get the dregs of humanity here,&#x201d; says Lieutenant John Hopkins, tonight&#x2019;s watch commander in the courthouse. &#x201c;If these people moved in next door to you, your lawn would die.&#x201d;<br><br>Hopkins believes in the golden rule. Treat the prisoners respectfully, he instructs his deputies, and don&#x2019;t get rough if you&#x2019;re not provoked. But some of his deputies are a little too eager to do unto others, he concedes, believing &#x201c;that the only justice is at the end of a good right cross.&#x201d; Hopkins doesn&#x2019;t spend much time in the basement, allowing Sergeant Thomas to run the show down here most evenings. Hopkins says an occupational hazard of his job as watch commander is &#x201c;the stiff neck you can get from looking the other way.&#x201d;<br><br>Sergeant Thomas, a tall, muscular African American, says the deputies threaten violence a lot more than they deliver it. Every now and then, though, certain prisoners require &#x201c;a little&#x2014;<i>positive reinforcement,</i>&#x201d; he says with a chuckle.<br><br>When the deputies have finished their pat-downs and the prisoners have been allowed to retrieve their coats from the pile, Thomas strides to the center of the group&#x2014;the head coach with the final pregame chat, now that his assistant has warmed up the team. &#x201c;I want to have a nice, quiet night,&#x201d; he tells the prisoners. &#x201c;I want to get done, have a drink, and go home. Gentlemen, your situation&#x2019;s fucked up enough as it is. You don&#x2019;t need it any more fucked up.&#x201d;<br><br>It&#x2019;s time to move these first twenty-five men to a bullpen around the corner to make room for another batch at the door. Bullneck instructs his prisoners to follow another deputy down the hall&#x2013;single file, hands behind their backs, of course. Shoves and shouts from Bullneck and his colleagues chase the line of prisoners on their way: &#x201c;Get the <i>fuck </i>going!&#x201d; &#x201c;Keep moving, <i>dick</i>head!&#x201d;<br><br>A different deputy gives the welcoming speech to the second bedraggled collection, reminding these men &#x201c;what a fucked-up bunch of smelly motherfuckers&#x201d; they are. There&#x2019;s never a lack of volunteers among the deputies for the honor of delivering the welcoming talk, with each succeeding speaker trying to outbadass the last one. &#x201c;Some of &#x2019;em get off on it more than others,&#x201d; Sergeant Thomas says.<br><br>A prisoner at the entrance complains of dizziness. He fell and hit his head shortly before his arrest, he tells Thomas. Thomas surveys the man&#x2019;s head for cuts or swelling, finds none. Almost every night the sergeant has to do a diagnosis such as this. Anyone who insists he needs medical care will be taken to nearby St. Anthony Hospital&#x2013;Holy Tony&#x2019;s, as the deputies call it. But Thomas discourages the trips when he&#x2019;s not convinced of the need. He knows some of the prisoners are merely trying to postpone their date with jail. The regulations require two deputies to accompany each prisoner who goes to the hospital, so Thomas would be shorthanded fast if he granted every request. There&#x2019;s paperwork involved as well. The prisoners aren&#x2019;t likely to expire in court, and in a couple of hours they&#x2019;ll either be the jail hospital&#x2019;s concern or, if they bond out, not the county&#x2019;s problem at all. Thus Thomas is often like the detective who persuades a suspect he doesn&#x2019;t really need a lawyer. For tonight&#x2019;s dizzy prisoner, he invokes one of his standard fabrications: &#x201c;I can send you to the hospital if you <i>want. </i>But the officer who drove you here? He&#x2019;s got to drive you to the hospital. And then you got to ride <i>all </i>the way back here with him.&#x201d; Dizzy or not, the prisoner gets Thomas&#x2019;s hint about the peril of being alone in the custody of an aggravated cop, and he decides to forgo medical aid.<br><br>The initial group of prisoners is occupying one of three bullpens down another hallway. The benches are full, the overflow on the floor. Soon the second group comes marching single file down the corridor and fills the middle bullpen. Thomas tells everybody that standing isn&#x2019;t allowed. Fights in the bullpens were common when Thomas began working bond court three years ago&#x2014;there were more &#x201c;gangbangers&#x201d; (gang members) being arrested then, he says. The fights led to the rule against standing, the idea being that it&#x2019;s harder to throw a punch while sitting. The prohibition probably isn&#x2019;t needed anymore, Thomas says, because the prisoners these days are mostly a docile bunch of addicts and small-time dealers. But rules are rules, and so when Thomas spots a man standing in bullpen two, he strides immediately over to him and booms, &#x201c;What the <i>fuck </i>you doing standing in my bullpen? Do I have to <i>chain </i>you to the floor to get you to sit down?&#x201d; The man quickly drops to the floor.<br><br>When more prisoners come down the hall, Thomas splits them between bullpens one and two, jamming those chambers, the men shoulder to shoulder on the benches and the floor. The female prisoners are being held in an anteroom near the basement entrance. Thomas wishes he could put some of the men in bullpen three, but it&#x2019;s occupied by the juveniles&#x2014;the kiddie criminals, as the ...</p><h2>Giants: The Global Power Elite</h2><p><b>A look at the top 300 most powerful players in world capitalism, who are at the controls of our economic future.</b><br><br>Who holds the purse strings to the majority of the world's wealth?

The book includes such power players as Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Jamie Dimon, and Warren Buffett.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the number of men with as much wealth as half the world fell from sixty-two to just eight between January 2016 and January 2017, according to Oxfam International, fewer than 200 super-connected asset managers at only 17 asset management firms&#x2014;each with well over a trillion dollars in assets under management&#x2014;now represent the financial core of the world's transnational capitalist class. Members of the global power elite are the management&#x2014;the facilitators&#x2014;of world capitalism, the firewall protecting the capital investment, growth, and debt collection that keeps the status quo from changing. Each chapter in <i>Giants</i> identifies by name the members of this international club of multi-millionaires, their 17 global financial companies&#x2014;and including NGOs such as the Group of Thirty and the Trilateral Commission&#x2014;and their transnational military protectors, so the reader, for the first time anywhere, can identify who constitutes this network of influence, where the wealth is concentrated, how it suppresses social movements, and how it can be redistributed for maximum systemic change.</p><p><b>PETER PHILLIPS</b> has been a professor of political sociology at Sonoma State University since 1994, was the director of Project Censored from 1996 to 2010, and the president of Media Freedom Foundation from 2003 to 2017. &nbsp;He has been editor or co-editor of fourteen editions of<i> Censored</i>, co-editor with Dennis Loo of <i>Impeach the President: The Case Against Bush and Cheney</i> (Seven Stories Press, 2006), and editor of two editions of <i>Progressive Guide to Alternative Media and Activism </i>(Seven Stories Press, 1999 and 2004)<i>.</i> He was a co-host of the weekly Project Censored show on Pacifica Radio with Mickey Huff from 2010 to 2017, originating from KPFA in Berkeley and airing on forty stations nationwide.

Shoup, author of&nbsp;<i>Wall Street&#x2019;s Think Tank</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The&nbsp;dire challenges facing people and planet are not accidents. They are&nbsp;products of a system in which a relatively small corporate elite use their domination of resources to increase their wealth, to control governments, and to marginalize or destroy those who might impair their power. Sociologist Peter Phillips goes beyond this generalization by identifying, in great detail, the actual people and corporations at the core. This book is a must read for those who believe that system change is necessary, who want to understand which players are most central to the system, and who are prepared to learn how the system can be transformed.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Marc Pilisuk, PhD, Professor Emeritus, University of California, and faculty, Saybrook University<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Peter Phillips carefully uncovers the manipulative ways used by global class elites to keep the world safe for the Superrich&#x2014;those who try to save capitalism from itself, a foul story we all need to&nbsp;hear and challenge.

Wright Mills&#x2019;s model of social structure from the national power elite to the transnational capitalist class.&nbsp;He identifies key power-holders within that class, thus highlighting an ethic of individual as well as institutional accountability.&nbsp;And he does so within a consistent human rights framework that is&nbsp;much required&nbsp;in today&#x2019;s political climate. <i>Giants: The Global Power Elite</i>&nbsp;is a crucial map for desperately needed social change.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Prof. Robert Hackett, School of Communication, Simon Fraser University<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The unabated global concentration of capital and deepening inequality is putting humanity on the brink of extinction.

This book outlines the handful of individuals who manage the most powerful think tanks, investment firms, and corporate boards, who make society&#x2019;s decisions at the expense of the planet. <br> &#x201c;<i>Giants</i> is an essential tool to understand those at the reigns of empire and capitalist hegemony, so we can be empowered to fight for our survival.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Abby Martin, host of the investigative news program <i>The Empire Files</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Following decades of research on power elites, Peter Phillips&#x2019;s book&nbsp;<i>Giants </i>exposes the power networks that link the world&#x2019;s wealthiest individuals and organizations and the ideological justifications that sustain their power. Impeccable original research provides the foundation for an impassioned call to action that reflects Phillips&#x2019;s abiding commitments to social justice and human rights.

As a radical sociologist whose work is reminiscent of the great C. Wright Mills, Dr. Phillips names these giants and gives the reader a useful primer for social activism. He details how these groups stay protected by private security firms and the ways in which media spin keeps them looking clean. Speaking truth to power, Dr. Phillips ends his work with an open letter to these global giants, which I proudly signed, inviting them to reimagine a more just society.&#x201d; <br> &#x2014;Susan Rahman, PhD<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Giants: The Global Power Elite</i> is a must-read for anyone concerned with how the concentration of wealth in the hands of a small number of global political elites affects the well-being of humanity and the ultimate sustainability of life on earth. In the best tradition of political sociology with a strong, data-driven analysis, Peter Phillips demonstrates that a small global power elite has &#x2018;rigged&#x2019; a global economy to serve its own interests at the expense of the well-being&#x2014;even the longevity&#x2014;of humankind.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;anthropologist Donna Brasset, PhD <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This book is a fearless expose of the ascendancy of a class of global elites and the power they wield around the world. Brilliantly argued and meticulously documented, the pages of this book lay bare the connections between power and wealth, and identify a system that allows a small minority of billionaires to control vast resources of the earth to devastating consequences. Phillips writes with compassion and humanity, and also tells us that unveiling mechanisms of power is a necessary first step in reshaping a global economic system to address the current crises of democracy, equality, and environmental destruction.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x2014;Robin Andersen, professor of Communication and Media Studies, Fordham University<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The global elite, with their associated armies and police forces are, at an accelerating rate, destroying the planet based on their bottom line, which clearly appears to be corporate profit and power at all costs.&nbsp;Indeed, the planet, our children, and grandchildren are facing a very bleak future if these titans of global control continue to have their way. Their policies have already carried us to the brink, putting life as we know it in jeopardy. <i>Giants: The Global Power Elite</i> is a field guide to what these greedy destroyers are up to in the name of profit and global control of planetary resources.

Peter Phillips shows that a mere seventeen institutions of financial capital, and the individuals who run them, exert a stunning degree of control over the fate of humanity.&nbsp;Dominated by white males of European descent, this inter-connected global power elite ensures the continued growth of capitalism at the expense of the vast majority.

Between 1400 and 1600, European perceptions of society, culture, politics and even humanity itself emerged in ways that continue to affect not only Europe but the entire world. <br>In this wide-ranging exploration of the Renaissance, Jerry Brotton shows the period as a time of unprecedented intellectual excitement, cultural experimentation, and interaction on a global scale, alongside a darker side of religion, intolerance, slavery, and massive inequality of wealth and status. Brotton skillfully guides us through the key issues that defined the Renaissance period, from its art, architecture, and literature, to advancements in the fields of science, trade, and travel. In its incisive account of the complexities of the political and religious upheavals of the period, the book argues that there are significant parallels between the Renaissance and our own era.

Semborska, who was seventeen, loved the way the comedy revue pushed the boundaries of what people in Poland could say out loud. Though it had been on the air for some years, with the rise of the labor union Solidarity, 60MPH had become much more bold. Sketches like one about a dim-witted Communist doctor looking vainly to find a cure for extremism were an inspiration to Anna and her teenage friends in Warsaw. The program showed her that other people felt about the world the way she did, but had never dared express. "We felt that if things like these can be said on the radio then we are free," she would remember nearly twenty years later. (1)<br><br>But when Anna ran to the radio to tune in the show on December 13, 1981, she heard only static. She tried another station, then another. Nothing. She tried to call a friend and found no dial tone. Her mother called her to the window. Tanks were rolling by. The Polish military government had declared martial law, outlawed Solidarity, and put the clamps back on the media and on speech. The Polish experiment with liberalization was over.<br><br>Within hours, Anna and her friends began to hear stories that suggested something this time was different. In a little town called 'Swidnik near the Czech border, there were the dogwalkers. Every night at 7:30, when the state-run television news came on, nearly everyone in 'Swidnik went out and walked his dog in a little park in the center of town.<br><br>It became a daily silent act of protest and solidarity. We refuse to watch. We reject your version of truth.<br><br>In Gdansk, there were the black TV screens. People there began moving their television sets to the windows-with the screens pointed out to the street. They were sending a sign to one another, and the government. We, too, refuse to watch. We also reject your version of truth.<br><br>An underground press began to grow, on ancient hand-crank equipment. People began carrying video cameras and making private documentaries, which they showed secretly in church basements. Soon, Poland's leaders acknowledged they were facing a new phenomenon, something they had to go west to name. It was the rise of Polish public opinion. In 1983, the government created the first of several institutes to study it. It mostly conducted public opinion surveys. Others would sprout up throughout Eastern Europe as well. This new phenomenon was something totalitarian officials could not dictate. At best, they could try to understand it and then manipulate it, not unlike Western democratic politicians. They would not succeed.<br><br>Afterward, leaders of the movement toward freedom would look back and think the end of Communism owed a good deal to the coming of new information technology and the effect it had on human souls. In the winter of 1989, the man who shortly would be elected Poland's new president visited with journalists in Washington. "Is it possible for a new Stalin to appear today who could murder people?" Lech Walesa asked rhetorically. No, he answered himself. In the age of computers, satellites, faxes, VCRs, "it's impossible." Technology now made information available to too many people, too quickly. And information created democracy. (2)<br><br>What is journalism for?<b><br></b><br>For the Poles and others in emerging democracies the question was answered with action. Journalism was for building community. Journalism was for citizenship. Journalism was for democracy. Millions of people, empowered by a free flow of information, became directly involved in creating a new government and new rules for the political, social, and economic life of their country. Is that always journalism's purpose? Or was that true for one moment, in one place?<br><br>In the United States for the last half century or so the question "What is journalism for?" has rarely been asked, by citizens or journalists. You owned a printing press or a broadcasting license and you produced journalism. In the United States journalism has been reduced to a simple tautology: It was whatever journalists said it was. As Maxwell King, the former editor of the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, has said, "We let our work speak for itself." Or, when pressed, journalists take it as a given that they work in the public interest. (3)<br><br>This simplistic answer is no longer sufficient &#x2014; if it ever really was to an increasingly skeptical public. Not now that the new communications technology with which anyone with a modem and a computer can claim to be "doing journalism." Not now that the technology has created a new economic organization of journalism in which the norms of journalism are being pulled and redefined, and sometimes abandoned.<br><br>Perhaps, some suggest, the definition of journalism has been exploded by technology, so now anything is seen as journalism.<br><br>But on closer examination, as the people of Poland demonstrated, the purpose of journalism is not defined by technology, or by journalists or the techniques they employ. As we will show, the principles and purpose of journalism are defined by something more basic &#x2014; the function news plays in the lives of people.<br><br>For all that the face of journalism has changed, indeed, its purpose has remained remarkably constant, if not always well served, since the notion of "a press" first evolved more than three hundred years ago. And for all that the speed, techniques, and character of news delivery have changed, there already exists a clear theory and philosophy of journalism that flows out of the function of news.<br><br><i>The primary purpose of journalism is to provide citizens with the information they need to be free and self-governing.</i><br><br>As we listened to citizens and journalists, we heard that this obligation to citizens encompasses several elements. The news media help us define our communities, and help us create a common language and common knowledge rooted in reality. Journalism also helps identify a community's goals, heroes, and villains. "I've felt strongly for a long time that we proceed best as a society if we have a common base of information," NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw told our academic research partners. (4) The news media serve as a watchdog, push people beyond complacency, and offer a voice to the forgotten. "I want to give voices to people who need the voice . . . people who are powerless," said Yuen Tying Chan, a former reporter for the New York Daily News who has created a journalism training program in Hong Kong.5 James Carey, one of the founders of our committee, has put it this way in his own writing: Perhaps in the end journalism simply means carrying on and amplifying the conversation of people themselves. (6)<br><br>This definition has held so consistent through history, and proven so deeply ingrained in the thinking of those who produce news through the ages, that it is in little doubt. It is difficult, in looking back, even to separate the concept of journalism from the concept of creating community and later democracy. Journalism is so fundamental to that purpose that, as we will see, societies that want to suppress freedom must first suppress the press. They do not, interestingly, have to suppress capitalism. At its best, as we will also show, journalism reflects a subtle understanding of how citizens behave, an understanding that we call the Theory of the Interlocking Public.<br><br>Yet the longstanding theory and purpose of journalism are being challenged today in ways not seen before, at least in the United States. Technology is shaping a new economic organization of information companies, which is subsuming journalism inside it. The threat is no longer simply from government censorship. The new danger is that independent journalism may be dissolved in the solvent of commercial communication and synergistic self-promotion. The real meaning of the First Amendment &#x2014; that a free press is an independent institution &#x2014; is threatened for the first time in our history even without government meddling.<br><br>There are some who will contend that defining journalism is dangerous. To define journalism, they argue, is to limit it. Maybe doing so violates the spirit of the First Amendment: "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech or of the press." This is why journalists have avoided licensing, like doctors and lawyers, they note. They also worry that defining journalism will only make it resistant to changing with the times, which probably will run it out of business.<br><br>Actually, the resistance to definition in journalism is not a deeply held principle but a fairly recent and largely commercial impulse. Publishers a century ago routinely championed their news values in front-page editorials, opinion pages, and company slogans, and just as often publicly assailed the journalistic values of their rivals. This was marketing. Citizens chose which publications to read based on their style and their approach to news. It was only as the press began to assume a more corporate and monopolistic form that it became more reticent. Lawyers also advised news companies against codifying their principles in writing for fear that they would be used against them in court. Avoiding definition was a commercial strategy. It was not born of the meaning of the First Amendment.<br><br>On the other side, some will argue that not only should journalism's purpose be unchanging, but its form should be constant as well. They see changes in the way journalism looks from when they were young, and fear that, in the memorable phrase of Neil Postman, we are "amusing ourselves to death." They miss another fact. Every generation creates its own journalism.<br><br>But the purpose, we have found, is the same.<br><br>Though journalists are uncomfortable defining what they do, they do fundamentally agree on their purpose. When we set out in 1997 to chart the common ground of newspeople, this was the first answer we heard: "The central purpose of journalism is to tell the truth so that people will have the information that they need to be sovereign." It came from Jack Fuller, an author, novelist, lawyer, and president of the Tribune Publishing Company, which produces the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>. (7)<br><br>Even people who resist the label of journalist, who work on the Web, offer a similar goal. Omar Wasow, a self-described "garage entrepreneur" who founded a website called New York Online, told us at one committee forum that his aim, in part, was helping to create citizens who are "consumers, devourers and debunkers of media . . . an audience who have engaged with the product and can respond carefully." (8)<br><br>Were these just disparate voices? Not really. In collaboration with the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, we asked journalists what they considered the distinguishing feature of journalism. Those working in news volunteered this democratic function by nearly two to one over any other answer. (9) Open-ended in-depth interviews with a hundred more journalists conducted by developmental psychologists at Stanford, Harvard, and the University of Chicago with whom we collaborated came to the same conclusion. "News professionals at every level . . . express an adamant allegiance to a set of core standards that are striking in their commonality and in their linkage to the public information mission," they write. (10)<br><br>Ethics codes and journalism mission statements bear the same witness. The goal is "to serve the general welfare by informing the people," says the code of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, the largest association of print newsroom managers in North America. "Give light and the people will find their own way," reads the masthead of Scripps Company newspapers. Indeed, every newspaper mission statement on file with the American Society of Newspaper Editors names advancing self-government as the primary goal of the news organization. (11)<br><br>Those outside journalism, too, understand a broader social and moral obligation for journalism. Listen to Pope John Paul II in June 2000: "With its vast and direct influence on public opinion, journalism cannot be guided only by economic forces, profit, and special interest. It must instead be felt as a mission in a certain sense sacred, carried out in the knowledge that the powerful means of communication have been entrusted to you for the good of all." (12)<br><br>This democratic mission is not just a modern idea. The concept of creating sovereignty has run through every major statement and argument about the press for centuries, not only from journalists but from the revolutionaries who fought for democratic principles, both in America and in virtually every developing democracy since.<br><br>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;-<br>Excerpt Endnotes<br>Excerpt Endnotes<br><br>1.Anna Semborska, interview by Dante Chinni, January 2000.<br>2.Thomas Rosenstiel, "TV, VCR's, Fan Fire of Revolution: Technology Served the Cause of Liberation in East Europe," Los Angeles Times, 18 January 1990.<br>3.Maxwell King, at founding meeting of Committee of Concerned Journalists (CCJ), 21 June 1997.<br>4.Tom Brokaw, interview by William Damon, Howard Gardner, and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.<br>5.Yuen Ying Chan, interview by Damon et al.<br>6.James Carey, James Carey: A Critical Reader, ed.

In his searing and moving essay, James Baldwin explores the Atlanta child murders that took place over a period of twenty-two months in 1979 and 1980. Examining this incident with a reporter's skill and an essayist's insight, he notes the significance of Atlanta as the site of these brutal killings&#x2015;a city that claimed to be "too busy to hate"&#x2015;and the permeation of race throughout the case: the black administration in Atlanta; the murdered black children; and Wayne Williams, the black man tried for the crimes. Rummaging through the ruins of American race relations, Baldwin addresses all the hard-to-face issues that have brought us a moment in history where it is terrifying to to be a black child in white America, and where, too often, public officials fail to ask real questions about "justice for all." Baldwin takes a time-specific event and makes it timeless: <i>The Evidence of Things Not Seen </i>offers an incisive look at race in America through a lens at once disturbing and profoundly revealing.</p></p><p>In this searing and moving essay, James Baldwin explores the Atlanta child murders that took place over a period of twenty-two months in 1979 and 1980.<p><b>James Baldwin</b>'s celebrated works of fiction include G<i>o Tell It on the Mountain, Giovanni's Room, Another Century, Tell Me How Long the Train's Been Gone, If Beale Street Could Talk, Just Above My Head</i>, and the short story collection <i>Going to Meet the Man.</i> He was also the author of a book of poetry, <i>Jimmy's Blues</i>, two dramatic works,<i> Blues for Mister Charlie</i> and <i>The Amen Corner, </i>and many works of nonfiction, including <i>Nobody Knows My Name, The Fire Next Time, </i>and <i>Notes of a Native Son. </i>Born in Harlem in 1924, he lived for many years in France, where he died in 1987.</p></p><h2>Little Fox in the Forest</h2><p><b>Fans of Aaron Becker&#x2019;s Caldecott Honor winner <i>Journey</i> will love this utterly enchanting wordless picture book in which two friends follow a young fox deep into the woods and discover a wondrous and magical world.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> When a young girl brings her beloved stuffed fox to the playground, much to her astonishment, a real fox takes off with it! The girl chases the fox into the woods with her friend, the boy, following close behind, but soon the two children lose track of the fox. Wandering deeper and deeper into the forest, they come across a tall hedge with an archway. What do they find on the other side? A marvelous village of miniature stone cottages, tiny treehouses, and, most extraordinary of all, woodland creatures of every shape and size. But where is the little fox?

Stephanie lives in Brooklyn, New York. Visit her at graegin.com.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;A series of monochromatic cells begin this wordless book. A young girl searches her house to bring her most treasured possession (her favorite toy, a stuffed fox) to share during show-and-tell at school. As readers turn pages, a young fox spots the toy unattended and swiftly runs off with it into the nearby forest, followed by the girl and a classmate. With each succeeding frame, the running fox is highlighted, brilliant orange against a neutral green-gray forest, each scene digitally colored with pencil, watercolor, and ink. Hidden residents gradually come to life with color until a turn of the page reveals a sudden double-page fantasy of small homes filled with personified animals. This tale of a missing toy builds to emphasize the girl's unselfishness&#x2014;a gesture of a generous heart. Movement of the characters from cell to cell encourages children to infer emotions and plot action, and page details will send viewers looking for small clues that broaden the story.

Lewis, himself a convert, wrote of being "surprised by joy" when he discovered his belief in Jesus Christ. In these 127 devotional readings, selected from Lewis's many works on faith and spirituality, Christians everywhere can share in the joy of this master theologian as he discusses topics ranging from the nature of prayer and good works to psychoanalysis and fascism. In <i>The Joyful Christian,</i> Lewis offers inspiration for all those who hunger and thirst after joy.</p><p>C.S. Lewis was a professor of medieval and Renaissance literature at Oxford and Cambridge universities who wrote more than thirty books in his lifetime, including <i>The Screwtape Letters, The Chronicles of Narnia,</i> and <i>Mere Christianity.</i> He died in 1963.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><i>Right and Wrong</i><br><br>Everyone has heard people quarreling. Sometimes it sounds funny and sometimes it sounds merely unpleasant; but however it sounds, I believe we can learn something very important from listening to the kinds of things they say. They say things like this: "How'd you like it if anyone did the same to you?" -- "That's my seat, I was there first" -- "Leave him alone, he isn't doing you any harm" -- "Why should you shove in first?" -- "Give me a bit of your orange, I gave you a bit of mine" -- "Come on, you promised." People say things like this every day, educated as well as uneducated, and children as well as grown-ups.<br><br>Now what interests me about all these remarks is that the man who makes them is not merely saying that the other man's behavior does not happen to please him. He is appealing to some kind of standard of behavior which he expects the other man to know about. And the other man very seldom replies: "To hell with your standard." Nearly always he tries to make out that what he has been doing does not really go against the standard, or that if it does there is some special excuse. He pretends there is some special reason in this particular case why the person who took the seat first should not keep it, or that things were quite different when he was given the bit of orange, or that something has turned up which lets him off from keeping his promise. It looks, in fact, very much as if both parties had in mind some kind of Law or Rule of fair play, or decent behavior, or morality, or whatever you like to call it, about which they really agreed. And they have. If they had not, they might, of course, fight like animals, but they could not <i>quarrel</i> in the human sense of the word. Quarreling means trying to show that the other man is in the wrong. And there would be no sense in trying to do that unless you and he had some sort of agreement as to what Right and Wrong are; just as there would be no sense in saying that a footballer had committed a foul unless there was some agreement about the rules of football.<br><br>Now this Law or Rule about Right and Wrong used to be called the Law of Nature. Nowadays, when we talk of the "laws of nature," we usually mean things like gravitation, or heredity, or the laws of chemistry. But when the older thinkers called the Law of Right and Wrong "the Law of Nature," they really meant the Law of <i>Human</i> Nature. The idea was that, just as all bodies are governed by the law of gravitation and organisms by biological laws, so the creature called man also had <i>his</i> law -- with this great difference, that a body could choose either to obey the Law of Human Nature or to disobey it.<br><br><i>The Universe</i><br><br>We want to know whether the universe simply happens to be what it is for no reason or whether there is a power behind it that makes it what it is. Since that power, if it exists, would be not one of the observed facts but a reality which makes them, no mere observation of the facts can find it. There is only one case in which we can know whether there is anything more, namely our own case, and in that one case we find there is. Or put it the other way round. If there was a controlling power outside the universe, it could not show itself to us as one of the facts inside the universe -- no more than the architect of a house could actually be a wall, or staircase, or fireplace in that house. The only way in which we could expect it to show itself would be inside ourselves as an influence or a command trying to get us to behave in a certain way. And that is just what we do find inside ourselves. Surely this ought to arouse our suspicions? In the only case where you can expect to get an answer, the answer turns out to be Yes; and in the other cases, where you do not get an answer, you see why you do not.<br><br>Suppose someone asked me, when I see a man in a blue uniform going down the street leaving little paper packets at each house, why I suppose that they contain letters? I should reply, "Because whenever he leaves a similar little packet for me I find it does contain a letter." And if he then objected, "But you've never seen all these letters which you think the other people are getting," I should say, "Of course not, and I shouldn't expect to, because they're not addressed to me. I'm explaining the packets I'm not allowed to open by the ones I'm allowed to open."<br><br>It is the same about this question. The only packet I'm allowed to open is Man. When I do, especially when I open that particular man called myself, I find that I do not exist on my own, that I am under a law; that somebody or something wants me to behave in a certain way. I do not, of course, think that if I could get inside a stone or a tree I should find exactly the same thing, just as I do not think all the other people in the street get the same letters as I do. I should expect, for instance, to find that the stone had to obey the law of gravity -- that whereas the sender of the letters merely tells me to obey the laws of my human nature, He compels the stone to obey the laws of its stony nature. But I should expect to find that there was, so to speak, a sender in both cases, a Power behind the facts, a Director, a Guide.<br><br><i>Life on Other Planets</i><br><br>I...fear the practical, not the theoretical, problems which will arise if ever we meet rational creatures which are not human. Against them we shall, if we can, commit all the crimes we have already committed against creatures certainly human but differing from us in features and pigmentation; and the starry heavens will become an object to which good men can look up only with feelings of intolerable guilt, agonized pity, and burning shame.<br><br>Of course, after the first debauch of exploitation we shall make some belated attempt to do better. We shall perhaps send missionaries. But can even missionaries be trusted? "Gun and gospel" have been horribly combined in the past. The missionary's holy desire to save souls has not always been kept quite distinct from the arrogant desire, the busybody's itch, to (as he calls it) "civilize" the (as he calls them) "natives." Would all our missionaries recognize a fallen race if they met it? Could they? Would they continue to press upon creatures that did not need to be saved that plan of Salvation which God has appointed for Man? Would they denounce as sins mere differences of behavior which the spiritual and biological history of these strange creatures fully justified and which God Himself had blessed? Would they try to teach those from whom they had better learn? I do not know.<br><br>What I do know is that here and now, as our only possible practical preparation for such a meeting, you and I should resolve to stand firm against all exploitation and all theological imperialism. It will not be fun. We shall be called traitors to our own species. We shall be hated of almost all men; even of some religious men. And we must not give back one single inch. We shall probably fail, but let us go down fighting for the right side. Our loyalty is due not to our species but to God. Those who are, or can become, His sons, are our real brothers even if they have shells or tusks. It is spiritual, not biological, kinship that counts.<br><br><i>God in Outer Space</i><br><br>The Russians, I am told, report that they have not found God in outer space. On the other hand, a good many people in many different times and countries claim to have found God, or been found by God, here on earth.<br><br>The conclusion some want us to draw from these data is that God does not exist. As a corollary, those who think they have met Him on earth were suffering from a delusion.<br><br>But other conclusions might be drawn.<br><br>(1) We have not yet gone far enough in space. There had been ships on the Atlantic for a good time before America was discovered.<br><br>(2) God does exist but is locally confined to this planet.<br><br>(3) The Russians did find God in space without knowing it because they lacked the requisite apparatus for detecting Him.<br><br>(4) God does exist but is not an object either located in a particular part of space nor diffused, as we once thought "ether" was, throughout space.<br><br>The first two conclusions do not interest me. The sort of religion for which they could be a defense would be a religion for savages: the belief in a local deity who can be contained in a particular temple, island, or grove. That, in fact, seems to be the sort of religion about which the Russians -- or some Russians, and a good many people in the West -- are being irreligious. It is not in the least disquieting that no astronauts have discovered a god of that sort. The really disquieting thing would be if they had.<br><br>The third and fourth conclusions are the ones for my money....<br><br>Space travel really has nothing to do with the matter. To some, God is discoverable everywhere; to others, nowhere. Those who do not find Him on earth are unlikely to find Him in space. (Hang it all, we're in space already; every year we go a huge circular tour in space.) But send a saint up in a spaceship and he'll find God in space as he found God on earth. Much depends on the seeing eye.<br><br><i>Atheism</i><br><br>My argument against god was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust. But how had I got this idea of <i>just</i> and <i>unjust?</i> A man does not call a line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line. What was I comparing this universe with when I called it unjust? If the whole show was bad and senseless from A to Z, so to speak, why did I, who was supposed to be part of the show, find myself in such violent reaction against it? A man feels wet when he falls into water, because man is not a water animal: a fish would not feel wet. Of course, I could have given up my idea of justice by saying it was nothing but a private idea of my own. But if I did that, then my argument against God collapsed too -- for the argument depended on saying that the world was really unjust, not simply that it did not happen to please my private fancies. Thus in the very act of trying to prove that God did not exist -- in other words, that the whole of reality was senseless -- I found I was forced to assume that one part of reality -- namely my idea of justice -- was full of sense. Consequently atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. <i>Dark</i> would be without meaning.<br><br><i>Seeing and Believing</i><br><br>In all my life I have met only one person who claims to have seen a ghost. And the interesting thing about the story is that that person disbelieved in the immortal soul before she saw the ghost and still disbelieves after seeing it. She says that what she saw must have been an illusion or a trick of the nerves. And obviously she may be right. Seeing is not believing.<br><br>For this reason, the question whether miracles occur can never be answered simply by experience. Every event which might claim to be a miracle is, in the last resort, something presented to our senses, something seen, heard, touched, smelled, or tasted. And our senses are not infallible. If anything extraordinary seems to have happened, we can always say that we have been the victims of an illusion. If we hold a philosophy which excludes the supernatural, this is what we always shall say. What we learn from experience depends on the kind of philosophy we bring to experience. It is therefore useless to appeal to experience before we have settled, as well as we can, the philosophical question. If immediate experience cannot prove or disprove the miraculous, still less can history do so. Many people think one can decide whether a miracle occurred in the past by examining the evidence "according to the ordinary rules of historical inquiry." But the ordinary rules cannot be worked until we have decided whether miracles are possible, and if so, how probable they are. For if they are impossible, then no amount of historical evidence will convince us. If they are possible but immensely improbable, then only mathematically demonstrative evidence will convince us: and since history never provides that degree of evidence for any event, history can never convince us that a miracle occurred. If, on the other hand, miracles are not intrinsically improbable, then the existing evidence will be sufficient to convince us that quite a number of miracles have occurred. The result of our historical inquiries thus depends on the philosophical views which we have been holding before we even began to look at the evidence. The philosophical question must therefore come first.<br><br><i>Miracle and the Laws of Nature</i><br><br>Three conceptions of the "Laws" of Nature have been held. (1) That they are mere brute facts, known only by observation, with no discoverable rhyme or reason about them. We know <i>that</i> Nature behaves thus and thus; we do not know <i>why</i> she does and can see no reason why she should not do the opposite. (2) That they are applications of the law of averages. The foundations of Nature are in the random and lawless. But the numbers of units we are dealing with are so enormous that the behavior of these crowds (like the behavior of very large masses of men) can be calculated with practical accuracy. What we call "impossible events" are events so overwhelmingly improbable -- by actuarial standards -- that we do not need to take them into account. (3) That the fundamental laws of Physics are really what we call "necessary truths" like the truths of mathematics -- in other words, that if we clearly understand what we are saying, we shall see that the opposite would be meaningless nonsense. Thus it is a "law" that when one billiard ball shoves another, the amount of momentum lost by the first ball must exactly equal the amount gained by the second. People who hold that the laws of Nature are necessary truths would say that all we have done is split up the single event into two halves (adventures of ball A, and adventures of ball B) and then discover that "the two sides of the account balance." When we understand this, we see that, of course, they <i>must</i> balance. The fundamental laws are in the long run merely statements that every event is itself and not some different event.<br><br>It will at once be clear that the first of these three theories gives no assurance against Miracles -- indeed no assurance that, even apart from Miracles, the "laws" which we have hitherto observed will be obeyed tomorrow. If we have no notion why a thing happens, then, of course, we know no reason why it should not be otherwise, and therefore have no certainty that it might not some day be otherwise.<br><br>The second theory, which depends on the law of averages, is in the same position. The assurance it gives us is of the same general kind as our assurance that a coin tossed a thousand times will not give the same result, say, nine hundred times: and that the longer you toss it, the more nearly the numbers of Heads and Tails will come to being equal. But this is so only provided the coin is an honest coin. If it is a loaded coin, our expectations may be disappointed. But the people who believe in miracles are maintaining precisely that the coin <i>is</i> loaded. The expectation based on the law of averages will work only for <i>undoctored</i> Nature. And the question whether miracles occur is just the question whether Nature is ever doctored.<br><br>The third view (that Laws of Nature are necessary truths) seems at first sight to present an insurmountable obstacle to miracle. The breaking of them would, in that case, be a self-contradiction and not even Omnipotence can do w...</p><h2>The Scribbly Man: The Children of D&#39;Hara, Episode 1 (1)</h2><p><b>From the internationally bestselling author of the Sword of Truth series comes a&nbsp;new Richard and Kahlan novella.&nbsp;</b>"They are the monsters under the bed when you are little, the shape just caught out&nbsp;of the corner of your eye when you thought you were alone,&nbsp;the shadow of&nbsp;something in a dark corner&nbsp;that surprises you and then isn't there.

She boldly confronts issues of privilege, race, and justice that yogis and meditators too often bypass, starting where it matters: from the inside out.

It invites us into the introspection of how to see more clearly and love more deeply through relevant, honest, and beautifully polished reflections that inform and reveal things we don&#x2019;t even know that we don&#x2019;t know. I LOVE this book! Quite frankly, I personally deem <i>Revolution of the Soul</i> necessary and required reading for all on the path of yoga . . . especially for yogis in the Western world.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>R.

Her voice, which I have been blessed to know for 20 years, is rich, astonishingly honest, messy, and messianic with promise and hope of transformative healing for all beings.

This book is fully the woman I know, trust, and love. Every word, every story, is filled with truth bombs and gorgeous wisdom, but what makes this book compelling is that Seane is a natural- born storyteller, and her life lessons read like a page-burner fiction. Except they are all true. These stories, like Seane herself, are raw, funny, deeply transparent, and unafraid to confront the power of our shared humanity and spirit. Seane shares them in service to help us relate to the challenges of our own life experience. Beyond the narratives she shares, what makes <i>Revolution of the Soul</i> so unique are the spiritual and psychological tools that accompany each story, helping us to unpack the deeper transformational wisdom that can lead to both personal and collective healing and peace.

The basis for the smash hit Tony Award-winning Broadway musical, Gregory Maguire's breathtaking <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>Wicked </i>views the land of Oz, its inhabitants, its Wizard, and the Emerald City, through a darker and greener (not rosier) lens. Brilliantly inventive, <i>Wicked</i> offers us a radical new evaluation of one of the most feared and hated characters in all of literature: the much maligned Wicked Witch of the West who, as Maguire tells us, wasn&#x2019;t nearly as <i>Wicked </i>as we imagined.</p></p><p>Following the traditions of Gabriel Garca Marquz, John Gardner and J.R.R. Tolkien, <i>Wicked</i> is a richly woven tale that takes us to the other, darker side of the rainbow as novelist Gregory Maguire chronicles the Wicked Witch of the West's odyssey through the complex world of Oz -- where people call you wicked if you tell the truth. <p>Years before Dorothy and her dog crash-land, another little girl makes her presence known in Oz. This girl, Elphaba, is born with emerald-green skin -- no easy burden in a land as mean and poor as Oz, where superstition and magic are not strong enough to explain or to overcome the natural disasters of flood and famine. But Elphaba is smart, and by the time she enters the university in Shiz, she becomes a member of a charmed circle of Oz' most promising young citizens. </p><p>Elphaba's Oz is no utopia. The Wizard's secret police are everywhere. Animals -- those creatures with voices, souls and minds -- are threatened with exile. Young Elphaba, green and wild and misunderstood, is determined to protect the Animals -- even it means combating the mysterious Wizard, even if it means risking her single chance at romance. Even wiser in guilt and sorrow, she can find herself grateful when the world declares her a witch. And she can even make herself glad for that young girl from Kansas. </p><p>In <i>Wicked</i>, Gregory Maguire has taken the largely unknown world of Oz and populated it with the power of his own imagination. Fast-paced, fantastically real and supremely entertaining, this is a novel of vision and re-vision. Oz never will be the same again.</p><p>When Dorothy triumphed over the Wicked Witch of the West in L. Frank Baum's classic tale, we heard only her side of the story. But what about her arch-nemesis, the mysterious Witch? Where did she come from? How did she become so wicked? And what is the true nature of evil?</p><p>Gregory Maguire creates a fantasy world so rich and vivid that we will never look at Oz the same way again. <em>Wicked</em> is about a land where animals talk and strive to be treated like first-class citizens, Munchkinlanders seek the comfort of middle-class stability, and the Tin Man becomes a victim of domestic violence. And then there is the little green-skinned girl named Elphaba, who will grow up to become the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, a smart, prickly, and misunderstood creature who challenges all our preconceived notions about the nature of good and evil.</p></p><h2>The Book of the Acts (New International Commentary on the New Testament)</h2><p>"<i>&#x201c;. . . undertaken to provide earnest students of the New Testament with an exposition that is thorough and abreast of modern scholarship and at the same time loyal to the Scriptures as the infallible Word of God.&#x201d;</i>"This statement reflects the underlying purpose of The New International Commentary on the New Testament.

For Durkheim, studying Aboriginal religion was a way "to yield an understanding of the religious nature of man, by showing us an essential and permanent aspect of humanity."

The terrible spectacle of the beast, the fog of the moor, the discovery of a body, this classic horror story pits detective against dog. When Sir Charles Baskerville is found dead on the wild Devon moorland with the footprints of a giant hound nearby, the blame is placed on a family curse. It is left to Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson to solve the mystery of the legend of the phantom hound before Sir Charles&#39; heir comes to an equally gruesome end.</p><p>We owe 1902's <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> to Arthur Conan Doyle's good friend Fletcher "Bobbles" Robinson, who took him to visit some scary English moors and prehistoric ruins, and told him marvelous local legends about escaped prisoners and a 17th-century aristocrat who fell afoul of the family dog. Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs?<p> Many Holmes fans prefer Doyle's complete short stories, but their clockwork logic doesn't match the author's boast about this novel: it's "a real Creeper!" What distinguishes this particular <i>Hound</i> is its fulfillment of Doyle's great debt to Edgar Allan Poe--it's full of ancient woe, low moans, a Grimpen Mire that sucks ponies to Dostoyevskian deaths, and locals digging up Neolithic skulls without next-of-kins' consent. "The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul," Watson realizes. "Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay ... while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet ... it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths." Read on--but, reader, watch your step! <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>For generations the curse had hung over the Baskerville family. Now another life had been claimed by the mysterious and terrifying beast. Was it a demon or an animal lurking on the descolate moor? Would the new master of the Baskerville home be its next victim?<p></p><p>Sherlock Holmes and Watson set out to solve the most bewildering and bloodcurdling case of their careers in this world-famous classic of mystery and suspense.</p></p><h2>Venetia (Regency Romances, 18)</h2><p><p><strong>Reading Georgette Heyer is the next best thing to reading Jane Austen."&#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong></p><p>Beautiful, capable, and independent minded, Venetia Lanyon's life on her family's estate in the country side is somewhat restricted.&nbsp;But her neighbor, the infamous Lord Damerel, a charming rake shunned by polite society, is about to shake things up.</p><p>Lord Damerel has built his life on his dangerous reputation, and when he meets Venetia, he has nothing to offer and everything to regret.

English Heritage has awarded Georgette Heyer one of their prestigious Blue Plaques, designating her Wimbledon home as the residence of an important figure in British history. She was born in Wimbledon in August 1902.

He runs his family life as he runs his firm: coldly, calculatingly and commercially. The only person he cares for is his frail son, grooming him for entry into the family business; his daughter Florence, abandoned and ignored, craves affection from her unloving father, who sees her only as a 'base coin that couldn't be invested'. As Dombey's callousness extends to others - from his defiant second wife Edith, to Florence's admirer Walter Gay - he sows the seeds of his own destruction. Can this heartless businessman be redeemed? A compelling depiction of a man imprisoned by his own pride, Dombey and Son explores the devastating effects of emotional deprivation on a dysfunctional family and on society as a whole. In his introduction, Andrew Sanders discusses the character of Paul Dombey, business and family relationships in <i>Dombey and Son</i> and their similarities to Dickens's own childhood. This edition also includes a chronology, further reading, appendices, notes and the original illustrations by 'Phiz'.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

As Jonathan Lethem contends in his Introduction, Dickens&#39;s &#34;genius . . . is at one with the genius of the form of the novel itself: Dickens willed into existence the most capacious and elastic and versatile kind of novel that could be, one big enough for his vast sentimental yearnings and for every impulse and fear and hesitation in him that countervailed those yearnings too. Never parsimonious and frequently contradictory, he always gives us everything he can, everything he&#39;s planned to give, and then more.&#34; This Modern Library Paperback Classic was set from the 1867 &#34;Charles Dickens&#34; edition.</p><h2>Introduction to African American Studies</h2><p>Highly Recommended. All levels/libraries--CHOICE <br><br>Everything you need to teach African American Studies is in this book.--Ahmad Rahman, Associate Professor of History, University of Michigan.<br> <br> There is an ongoing debate as to whether African American Studies is a discipline, or multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary field. Some scholars assert that African American Studies use a well-defined common approach in examining history, politics, and the family in the same way as scholars in the disciplines of economics, sociology, and political science. Other scholars consider African American Studies multidisciplinary, a field somewhat comparable to the field of education in which scholars employ a variety of disciplinary lenses-be they anthropological, psychological, historical, etc., --to study the African world experience. In this model the boundaries between traditional disciplines are accepted, and researches in African American Studies simply conduct discipline based an analysis of particular topics. Finally, another group of scholars insists that African American Studies is interdisciplinary, an enterprise that generates distinctive analyses by combining perspectives from different traditional disciplines and synthesizing them into a unique framework of analysis.</p><p><b>Talmadge Anderson</b> was professor emeritus of the Department of Comparative American Cultures and Marketing at Washington State University.

It reveals stunning details of life-and-death decision-making, top-secret military operations and high level peace negotiations. The Prime Ministers brings readers into the orbits of world figures, including Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Rabin, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Henry Kissinger, Yasser Arafat, Margaret Thatcher, Princess Diana and the Lubavitcher Rebbe. Written in a captivating literary style by a political adviser, speechwriter and diplomat, The Prime Ministers is an enthralling political memoir, and a precisely crafted prism through which to view current Middle East affairs. The Prime Ministers is the basis of a major documentary produced by Moriah Films, the Academy Award-winning film division of the Simon Wiesenthal Center.</p><p>This is not a conventional biography or memoir, nor is it a work of fiction. It deals with factual events and real people, most notably Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol, Golda Meir, Yitzhak Rabin and Menachem Begin, all of whom I served in one capacity or another, junior and senior, over many years, and all of whom I have tried in these pages to bring back to life as I recall them. Having worked in their proximity in all manner of situations, good and bad - sometimes so bad as to call into question Israel's very survival - I have sought here to resurrect episodes which illustrate their responses in times of stress, recreate some unforgettable intimate moments, and reenact their intertwining relationships and dealings with presidents, prime ministers and other dignitaries - all ratified, so to speak, by the viewpoint of the proverbial fly on the wall. <br> <br>Inevitably, an autobiographical footprint appears in this personal narrative, firstly to illustrate the times into which I was born, secondly to introduce some extraordinary characters whose paths I crossed along the way, and thirdly and most significantly, to recapture how&nbsp;I came to be in the company of such amazing individuals, these early leaders of Israel, who were thrust into my life with such collision force that their hold on my imagination is intensely alive and personal still. I am everlastingly grateful for having had the opportunity to work for and alongside such prime ministers, and for having had my eyes opened to the fact that occasionally such larger-than-life champions of the Jewish people exist on earth.Yehuda Avner served as adviser and English speechwriter to Israeli Prime Ministers Rabin, Begin, Meir and Eshkol.

The Osho approach to sex begins with an understanding of how important love is in our lives, while at the same time acknowledges that the journey into love cannot exclude our innate biological energies.

We learn how orgasm offers a glimpse of timelessness, thoughtlessness, and pure awareness&#x2015;biology&#x2019;s way of pointing toward the consciousness that helps us to understand ourselves.</p><p>Finally, we are presented with a clear choice: a repressed sexuality that leads to pornography, perversion, and a stunted humanity or a playful, respectful, and relaxed innocence that supports us in becoming fulfilled and whole, as nature intended.</p><p><b>Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness.

The red light of sundown reflected from its windshield. Above the line of yellow cottonwoods along the San Juan River the shape of Shiprock was blueblack and ragged against the glow. The car looked brand new and it was rolling slowly across the gravel, the driver leaning out the window just a little. The driver had yelled at Joseph Joe. </p><p>"Hey!" he'd yelled. "Come here a minute." </p><p>Joseph Joe remembered that very clearly. The driver looked like a Navajo, but yelling at him like that was not a Navajo thing to do because Joseph Joe was eighty-one years old, and the people around Shiprock and up in the Chuska Mountains called him Hosteen, which means "old man" and is a term of great respect. </p><p>Joseph Joe had put his laundry sack into the back of his daughter's pickup truck and walked over to the car. He noticed its plates weren't yellow, like New Mexico's, or white, like Arizona's. They were blue. </p><p>"I'm looking for a man named Gorman," the driver had said. "Leroy Gorman. A Navajo. Moved here little while ago." </p><p>"I don't know him," Joseph Joe had said. He had said it in Navajo, because when he got close he saw he had been right. The man was a Navajo. But the driver just frowned at him. </p><p>"You speak English?" the driver asked. </p><p>"I don't know Leroy Gorman." Hosteen Joe said it in English this time. </p><p>"He's been around here several weeks," the driver said. "Young fellow. Little older than me. Medium-sized. Hell, small as this place is, I'd think you'd have seen him." </p><p>"I don't know him," Joseph Joe repeated, "I don't live in this town. I live at my daughter's place. Out there near the Shiprock." Joseph Joe had gestured toward the Arizona border and the old volcano core outlined by the sunset. "Don't live in here with all these people," he explained. </p><p>"I'll bet you've seen him," the driver said. He took out his billfold and fished a photograph out of it. "This is him," the driver said and handed the photograph to Hosteen Joe. </p><p>Joseph Joe looked at it carefully, as courtesy demanded. It was a Polaroid photograph, like the ones his granddaughter took. There was something written on the back of it, and an address. The front was a picture of a man standing by the door of a house trailer, which was partly shaded by a cottonwood tree. Hosteen Joe took off his glasses and wiped them off carefully on his sleeve and looked a long time at the young man's face. He didn't recognize him, and that's what he said when he handed the driver his photograph. After that, he didn't remember the rest of it quite as clearly because just then it all began to happen. </p><p>The driver was saying something to him about the trailer, maybe about Gorman living in it or trying to sell it or something, and then there was the sound of a car braking on the highway, tires squealing a little, and the car backing up and whipping around and driving into the Wash-O-Mat parking lot. This car was new too. A Ford sedan. </p><p>It stopped just in front of the driver's car. A man wearing a plaid coat got out of it and walked toward them and then stopped suddenly, apparently noticing Joseph Joe for the first time. Plaid Coat said something to the driver. As Joseph Joe remembered, it was "Hello, Albert," but the driver didn't say anything. Then Plaid Coat said, "You forgot to do what you were told. You've got to come along with me. You're not supposed to be here." Or something like that. And then he had looked at Joseph Joe and said, "We've got business, old man. You go away now." </p><p>Hosteen Joe had turned then and walked back toward his daughter's truck. Behind him he heard the sound of a car door opening. Then closing. A yell. The sharp clap of a pistol shot. And then another shot, and another, and another. When he turned he saw Plaid Coat on the gravel and the driver holding himself up by clinging to the door of his car. Then the driver got in and drove away. When the car got to the asphalt, it turned toward the river and toward the junction, which would either take it west toward Teec Nos Pos or south toward Gallup. </p><p>People were running out of the Wash-O-Mat by then, yelling questions.

My old passports show that I visited the San Juan River area twenty-two times in about five years, and my memories today just meld into one great adventure of giant tarpon on the fly rod, snook by the shoals, and iguana-shooting for the pot. There were no telephones, no worries, and no guerrilla wars on that border with northern Costa Rica. Although the tarpon fishing was so fabulous that it was not unusual to jump at least a hundred-odd silver kings in a day's fishing, it became like a diet of pure caviar: delicious and rare, but almost tiresome in the end, as you knew that just about every time you cast a long, saddle-hackled offering, something with a mouth like a bailing bucket would try to eat it. If the first one missed, another would grab it. It was at this point that I got involved with the sharks, often completely ignoring the fly-fishing in favor of the long iron.</i><i>In those days, when Nicaragua simply lay in the sun, improving its tan, and growing plantains, the locals considered the idea of harpooning sharks some weird form of northern madness. Perhaps that made it even more interesting. Anyway, we did it, and it developed into an activity of sufficient insanity to attract ABC Television's "The American Sportsman," featuring Jack Nicklaus. To observe that the exercise didn't work out would be rather like concluding that the</i> Titanic <i>didn't make it to full expectations.</i><i>I doubt you could get to the San Juan today at all, but back then we had to hire the Nicaraguan Air Force to fly us in to the head of the river where we took dugoutsdownstream. On one of these jaunts, the lieutenant piloting me to San Carlos overshot the rough runway at deep dusk and tore off both wings of the single-engined Cessna between two palm trees. Soaked with aviation gas, we both crawled from the wreckage without too much personal damage. That the plane did not burn is why you are now reading this.</i><i>Incidentally, it seems that the conclusions I reached twenty years ago, based as they were on the best ichthyological data available concerning the migratory habits of bull sharks, may have been erroneous. It would seem that</i> Carcharhinus leucas <i>does trade back and forth between fresh and salt water. I am still convinced, however, that although this may well be the case with some individual sharks, many are permanent residents of Lake Nicaragua and of the San Juan River. Perhaps time and further research on the species, certainly the biggest killer near South African river mouths, will shed more light on the unusual habits of these sharks.</i>Jos�'s mahogany knuckles tightened and showed white as the long anchor line came taut. In a practiced motion, the fishing-safari guide deftly dropped a loop over the bow post and the heavy dugout swung to a halt.We were anchored in "the pool," as the natives know it, where Nicaragua's San Juan River byways merge to form a dread outpost for the voracious freshwater shark. In the vicinity, at the moment, about thirty big, slate-colored dorsal fins cut the surface.Upstream from us, beyond a shallow stretch, the water became deep again and was flecked with a patchwork of bright jungle sunshine that filtered through the treetops overhangingthe bank. Antenna-tailed parrots and colorful dragonflies darted about overhead like spectators to the coming encounter. The heavy air was oppressive and ominous.As we watched, every few minutes a big shark or two would splash across the shallow water and slide into the deep-water hunting grounds upstream.Nicaragua is one of the strangest geological areas on earth. It has two major lakes (both densely populated by killer sharks) and a string of twenty-three volcanoes that run down the western side of the country, many of which are still active. In 1835, one of these, Coseguina, blew its top with a roar heard in Bogota, Colombia, 1,100 miles away. Pieces of the cone landed as far as 150 miles out to sea. The capital city of Managua was itself leveled by an earthquake in 1931, with a terrible loss of life.But the history of life and death in the area seemed much more remote, at that moment, than the possibility of a personal disaster. Watching Jose study the menacing fins, one sensed that he knew the ferocity of the beasts beneath the surface of the chocolate-colored water better than an ordinary fisherman. Needless to say, I was pleased to have him along.At last, turning his attention to the twelve feet of hardwood lying along the gunwale, he asked, <i>"Listo, Patr�n?"</i> ("Are you ready?") I glanced at the heavy harpoon, the hand-forged point glinting from its fresh honing. The silky, white nylon sash cord was securely wired to the ring welded below the steel barbs. It ran along the shaft to the slipknot six feet up the green wood, and trailed off to a neat coil in the dugout's bow. The rig was ready. "<i>Listo,</i>" I said, wondering if this was quite as good an idea as it had seemed an hour ago. Jos� mumbled something in Spanish about his spiritual future, crossed himself, and swung the bloody sack over the side into the murky water ...&nbsp;<br>My first exposure to Nicaragua's dread freshwater sharks came over a very dry martini. I was lunching with Alfredo Bequillard, Jr., the owner of Tarpon Camp, a famous hot spot on the San Juan River, Lake Nicaragua's only connection with the men at sea. I had been sent to Nicaragua by Winchester Adventures,Inc., a subsidiary of the well-known arms manufacturers, to check out the fantastic tarpon fishing on the San Juan. Winchester represents a string of top-notch outfits like Alfredo's around the world, each personally inspected by their staffers before receiving their seal of approval.Al told me that only three weeks before, a young boy had taken a dive into the river at San Carlos, a small village located at the mouth of the river where it flows from Lake Nicaragua to the Caribbean, some 130 miles away. The boy surfaced and immediately was dragged shrieking beneath the surface by a large shark. No part of the boy was ever found, Al told me. One day in 1944, three persons were attacked by a single shark near Granada, a good-sized city on the shores of the lake. Two were killed and one badly mauled. My own guide, Jose, told me that his uncle had been killed by a river shark in 1960, just below the location of the present camp. He had fallen overboard and what was recovered of the shredded torso indicated that more than one man-eater was on the prowl that afternoon. When I arrived on the river, a few days later, I was told of eight other definite shark attacks that had had fatal consequences. I spoke with one old man who had been grabbed by the foot in very shallow water by a four-footer. Two toeswere missing and infection had set in. He had pried the shark loose with his hands.Nicaraguans who live along the river say that at least one person each year is taken by the sharks, sometimes four or five. In the village of Castillo, about halfway between giant Lake Nicaragua and the sea, there was one very big shark that hung out at the base of a set of small rapids. This monster had terrorized fishermen for a three-month period, ramming light dugouts and seizing paddles in his huge jaws. He would attack anything that entered his territory. The river people knew it was always the same shark from his extreme size and the definite yellow cast of his hide. Finally harpooned and shot, he was over twelve feet in length.No one has ever been able to completely unravel the riddle of the freshwater shark. Probably the most logical theory as to how a saltwater animal came to survive and prosper in fresh water is that Lake Nicaragua was once a large saltwater bay. During one of the cataclysmic upheavals of the earth common to this region, a land bridge was raised, cutting off the bay from the sea, forming the lake. In it were, of course, all the species of fish normally found in the saltwater Central American zone. As the ages passed, the water became less and less salty through dilution by heavy rainfall, and most of the ocean species died. However, the cub shark, also known as the ground or bull shark, did adapt and exists today as the freshwater variant called the Lake Nicaragua shark <i>(Carcharhinus nicaraguensis).</i> The U.S. Navy "Shark Danger" ratings list the Lake Nicaragua shark on a par with the feared tiger shark, giving a rating of 2 +.There are many other species in the lake and the San Juan River that are common to both fresh and salt water, namely the snook, tarpon and sawfish. These species are, however, anadromous, meaning that, like the shad and salmon, they will run into fresh water as a matter of normal course.The Lake Nicaragua shark is considered to be the only true freshwater shark, but the habit of other species of shark to enter fresh water is not as rare an occurrence as it might at first seem. There is an Indian variety, the Ganges shark, that kills an average of twenty bathers a year in that holy river. In 1959,during a two-month period, thirty-five persons were mauled or killed in the Devi River by this shark.Sharks have been reported up rivers in such far-flung places as Thailand, Malaya, New Zealand, South Africa, Mozambique, Peru, Guatemala, Australia, Japan, and Fiji. A British military ambulance driver was one of twenty-seven people both mauled and killed in the Karun River of Iran during an eight-year period in the 1940s. A seven-hundred pounder was even found on the beach of Marlboro, New York, fifty miles up the Hudson River, after what was probably a collision with a steamboat in 1926. Eight years later, New York City police flashed a shark alert along the Hudson as far north as Poughkeepsie. A shark had been sighted off the West 42nd Street pier, six blocks from Times Square.These cases, however, are clearly of sharks that have come from the sea into fresh water and then returned to the sea. The Lake Nicaragua shark is born, lives, and dies completely in fresh water, quite unlike all other species. Natives of the river claim that there are, in fact, two varieties of killers haunting their waters, the reddish-bellied <i>tintorero</i> and the white-bellied <i>visitante</i>, which they believe does run in from the sea. I think this theory is false. Many of the sharks I have harpooned over several trips to the San Juan would roll upon feeling the steel, clearly showing their snow-white bellies. But, after a long fight against the line, they had pink or red bellies upon being dispatched. It seems to me that the exertion of the fight would break the small blood vessels under the skin, and the blood could be seen through the white skin. Also, if some did run in from the sea, why did they only run up the San Juan? There are many rivers along Central America's east coast, yet only the San Juan and Lake Nicaragua hold these killers.Alfredo's camp turned out to be an absolute paradise for tarpon. The run of these silver kings (many well over one hundred pounds) between January and June is simply fantastic. But after three days of even this great fishing, I still couldn't get the sharks off my mind. We had caught two on handlines off the camp's dock, and I was amazed to see them clear the water in high, twisting leaps. We had also witnessed their speed and ferocious power as they attacked hooked tarpon wewere fighting. They would slash in, either alone or in packs, surrounding the big tarpon. A sudden charge, and they would rip thirty-pound chunks of flesh from the fear-mad tarpon. We would cut the line, but it was always too late as they would glide away in a cloud of spreading blood. It made me sick to see these great gamesters butchered like that. Then Jose asked whether I was willing to try the pool. Maybe the heat was getting to me, but I said yes.Jos� hauled the anchor and we went off to the village of Castillo to barter some .22-caliber cartridges for three of the big harpoon heads. We cut a twelve-foot sapling and shaped the thick end of it to fit the skirtlike base of the steel, much the way a hoe head fits its shaft. On the way back to the pool, we stopped and bought the entrails of a cow that had been slaughtered that morning. Jos� put the reeking mess into a burlap sack and tied a short length of rope around the neck. I broke out the long nylon handline and two hundred feet of sash cord, checked the .357 Magnum at my belt and we were in business ... .&nbsp;<br>A cloud of red blossomed from the bag Jose had swung over the side, and the blood surged downstream into the pool. Thirty seconds went by. Then we saw it. It started with a small V on the dark surface, rising slowly until a foot and a half of the fin gleamed like wet lead above the long, tapered shape. It cut the water like a tiny sailboat tacking as the huge shark cast its ten-foot length back and forth like a pointer trying to locate a running quail. Other dorsals appeared as the bag of bloody cattle entrails seeped its invitation into the current. I slipped the leather glove over my left hand and raised the harpoon as the shark moved out of the pool and headed directly for us, the long upper lobe of the tail waving above the shallow water.It glided closer to the dugout, the half-open mouth agleam with snaggled teeth, its cat's eyes reflecting dully as it paused in a patch of sunshine ten feet away. A gentle thrust of the big tail brought it nearer. At five feet, I threw with every ounce of strength I had, hearing the <i>thug</i> as the steel tore through gristle and muscle. For a fraction of a second, nothing happened. <i>Then it charged.</i> It hit the side of the dugout while I was still off balance from the thrust. The long harpoon shaft,jutting from the top of its head, flashed by my face as I felt myself teetering over the enraged shark.My stomach flipped as I felt myself start to fall over the side. The shark, harpoon-head jutting from its skull, lay four feet away, watching me, wounded but waiting like a striking bushmaster. Jose's hand flashed out and grabbed my belt, jerking me backward into the bottom of the dugout. We almost swamped the light craft, but somehow we didn't go over. I felt as if I'd been quite literally snatched from the jaws of fate.The shark reacted by turning and tearing off downstream, the harpoon line melting from the coil of rope in the bow. I grabbed the nylon with my gloved hand and tried to slow down its escape. I might as well have tried to snub a falling safe. There was simply no holding it. The balsa-wood float tied to the end of the line whipped off the bow, and skittered across the surface like a terrified, giant waterbug. Jos� hoisted the anchor and we followed, catching up with the float a half-mile away in quiet, deep water. I plucked the float from the water and felt the throbbing power at the end of the line again. Slowly, I worked it in, only to have it take off again, the line ripping through my fingers. Finally, after almost an hour, we worked it close enough to put four .357-caliber tranquilizers through the Y-shaped brain. That quieted it down quite a bit.I slipped the big gaff into the killer's gill slits and we tried to haul it aboard. It was useless. It must have weighed over four hundred pounds. I wasn't so hot to share the accommodations, anyway. It took another hour to haul it upstream against the current to our camp, but we were anxious for a look...This anthology of Capstick's articles range from 1969 into the 1980s and were selected from such popular general hunting and shooting magazines as Guns &amp; Ammo , American Hunter , and Petersen's Hunting . Capstick lives in Africa; his first love is Africa; his forte is in his knowledge of and writings about Africa, rather than "on five continents." His fishing expertise is reflected only in a couple of articles among the total 24. Each selection in the book is prefaced by an informative introduction by Capstick, which adds immensely to the articles. Outdoor sports and adventure collections where the author's Death in the Long Grass (1978) and Death in the Dark Continent (1983) are popular will want to consider this.<br><i>- Eugene J.

At both ends of the dirt road that fronts my house, cows amble up and down the slanted pastures most of the year, chewing on the landscape. I often marvel at how their bodies transform the raw weeds and green of the field into snow-white milk. The fact that their milk is laden with the supple fat that men conjure into golden butter seems all the more incredible. There&#x2019;s a Rumpelstiltskin-like magic to these dairy conversions. Even if modern science can explain the processes in cold detail, I find them no less dazzling. In fact, as I discovered writing this book, knowing all the intricate workings of animal nature and human endeavor that turn plant life into butter only added to my fascination.<br><br> And yet butter is uniformly taken for granted. It is common, after all. The girl next door, lovely but overlooked. Even for me, a food professional with more than two decades of experience as a pastry chef, test kitchen editor, and food writer, butter had long lived in the culinary shadows. My work paid and trained me to seek out the exotic, the celebrity foods, the Next Big Thing. Not a simple yellow stick that&#x2019;s in everyone&#x2019;s fridge. Although I cooked and baked often with butter and always had it on the table, I hardly gave this dairy staple much thought. It wasn&#x2019;t until several years ago, when I was assigned an editorial project to taste, describe, and rate about two dozen different brands from creameries around the world, that I did a double take on butter. On the tasting table were bricks of butter from as far away as New Zealand, Italy, the Czech Republic, Ireland, and France, plus domestic brands from Vermont, Wisconsin, California, and places in between. At the time, the task seemed like a redundant one. Butter is so elemental, I thought, how different from one another could they really be?<br><br> But as I examined and tasted each sample, I was surprised that no two were alike. I found nuances in color, consistency, milkiness, salt content, sweetness, acidity, freshness, even nutty and herbal notes. Some glistened; others were matte. Some butters slumped as they sat at room temperature, others stood firm. Several had a fresh, lactic taste while a few were cultured and more tangy. One was made from the milk of goats, another from water buffalo. Cataloging this global collection, with their odd labels and unfamiliar names, I began to sense that these sticks and bricks represented both the universal and the particular of this thing we call butter (which has at least fifty-seven aliases around the world; see appendix B). All the products were essentially made the same way&#x2014;from churning milk fat&#x2014;yet each sample was distinguishable from another. It was as if every butter brand was a kind of message in a bottle, relaying a distinct sense of place.<br><br> It turns out that my impression wasn&#x2019;t just a romantic one. Every detail of a particular butter&#x2019;s character is indeed formed from the unique commingling of three living variables: man, plant, and beast. They work as a kind of relay team, beginning with the plant forage (or ration) that feeds the dairy animal, which in turn gives milk to the farmer, who then supplies the butter maker with cream, which is then churned into butter (and buttermilk). In combination, all of these individual players and conditions account for both the subtle and substantial butter differences I detected on the tasting table that day. As this trio of live factors varies from one place and time to another, sweet butter can express locality in a very pure, direct way. (Other dairy products, like yogurt and cheese, can make a similar claim, but these fermented products generally require more time and biological intervention to produce. Uncultured butter, on the other hand, can be borne almost immediately.)<br><br> Before dairy industrialization began in Europe and North America in the late nineteenth century, the local terroir of a butter was much in evidence; every farmhouse was in essence a tiny artisan creamery, dispensing its version of the stuff (for better or worse). But by the twentieth century&#x2014;the era when men and machines would completely displace generations of farmwives and dairymaids in the production of butter&#x2014;the new milk co-ops and automated creameries ushered in conformity, consistency, and a new standard of freshness. As this industrial dairy model grew, butter from the factory churn came to reflect the technology of megaproducers rather than the terroir of local farms and small-scale makers. National brands emerged, which meant you could buy butter in, say, Michigan that tasted identical to one on the shelf in Maryland. (We&#x2019;ve come to take this convenient uniformity for granted too, but it&#x2019;s a very recent phenomenon in the long arc of dairy history.)<br><br> Now, in the twenty-first century, technology has been thrown in reverse. A &#x201c;slow butter&#x201d; revivalism is emerging, especially where the demand for local products and the lure of artisan food is high. The ranks of these new outliers on the butter-making scene include mostly entrepreneurial low-tech dairy folk looking to sustain their farms and way of life. But there&#x2019;s also a sizable troupe of chefs, avid foodists, and staunch do-it-yourselfers&#x2014;all batch-churning their own microbutters for an enthusiastic niche of eaters.<br><br> Lauding this movement is not to suggest that there&#x2019;s anything wrong with industrial butter production. Indeed, as detailed in chapter 6, the advent of dairy factories in the late nineteenth century greatly raised butter standards across the board and gave it a new threshold of freshness. But whenever a traditional food is rediscovered by artisans, we stand to gain interesting choices, perchance even more delicious, creative, and/or healthful ones. (Consider the modern bread revolution, for example, or the neochocolate scene.) Politically there can be benefits as well, when we get to vote our values by buying less processed, more locally crafted foods that short cut the farm-to-fork journey.<br><br> Butter allows another kind of trip too. For the inquisitive eater who savors more than just the taste of things, butter&#x2019;s story is a ticket to appreciating the mighty role a simple food can play in the course of human events. One of the oldest of man-made edibles, butter&#x2019;s history is our history. In part, the purpose of this book is to show how the life and times of butter have been deeply entwined with much that has gone on far from the kitchen and creamery. Beginning with early butter practices devised for the religious, spiritual, and medicinal needs of communities, to its impact on empire building and technology of the Industrial Revolution, and later to butter&#x2019;s twentieth-century battle with margarine makers and fat-free zealots, this is a food, unlike any other, whose history reveals our ambitions as much as our appetite.<br><br> The contemporary butter world, in all its multicultural wonder, is no less remarkable. In the course of doing research for this book, I traveled on three continents and across the United States, each stop adding another strong thread to the weave of butter&#x2019;s modern narrative. Of course, I also gleaned many facts about butter from books, articles, and online sources, but for the full sensorial experience of butter and the people and regions it comes from, I had to dust off mypassport. To see the making of butter from water buffalo milk in Punjab, India, and taste it fresh from the churn was nothing like watching and sampling sheep butter making in California and cow&#x2019;s butter in Brittany and industrial butter making in Wisconsin.<br><br> Front-line food study like this is called field research, but to me it was more like butter hunting. Capturing firsthand details helped me construct a time capsule of butter life as it exists now, as well as record some of the ancient methods that are rapidly disappearing in many remote areas, where new generations have eschewed their parents&#x2019; subsistence chores and occupations. Working the butter beat also led me to some interesting encounters on the fringes of dairydom. I met with a former Buddhist nun to learn about the intricacies of Tibetan butter carving, and with various scientists to understand udders, soil, and fat metabolism. I spent a week in a large fridge with the artist who sculpts the Iowa State Fair butter cow each year, and I met with a New Jersey man to see his vast personal collection of vintage butter making equipment and ephemera. I&#x2019;ve toured the Butter Museum in Cork, Ireland, the Maison du Beurre in Brittany, and gazed up at the infamous Butter Tower in Rouen, France. And in bakeries, restaurants, and culinary schools, I&#x2019;ve watched chefs work their magic with butter.<br><br> Still, the most essential players in the story of butter aren&#x2019;t the people or institutions that I&#x2019;ve met or who appear at various points in its timeline. That honor goes to the animals that first make the milk that begets butter. The true provenance of butter isn&#x2019;t just cultural; it&#x2019;s also anatomical.<br><br> WE OWE THE PLEASURE of every buttery morsel to a legion of four-legged farmstead moms. Because these udder-equipped mothers start to make milk as soon as their newborns arrive and for many months after, we have become the beneficiaries of a seemingly perpetual lactic supply. From this daily cascade of animal milk, butter makers extract the richest portion&#x2014;cream&#x2014;to churn into the solids we call butter. (It&#x2019;s possible to churn whole, nonhomogenized milk into butter too, but the process takes much longer and is trickier to manage.)<br><br> Considering what causes maternity and milk in the first place, one might argue that butter actually begins with sex, usually with the tryst of a bull and cow that makes a baby calf. And more than a century ago that would have been true. But since the invention of artificial insemination for livestock, this carnal connection to butter is no longer a given. Either by philosophical choice or by necessity, only small dairies (including goat and sheep operations) rely on animal attraction to trigger pregnancy and thereby lactation. Otherwise, many dairy gals never even see a bull (or buck or ram)&#x2014;let alone cavort with one.<br><br> Although maternity flips the switch of milk production in many species all across the world, none make it so abundantly as the kinds of livestock that have become synonymous with dairy farming. Cows especially, but producers also count on the milk from sheep, goats, yak, buffalo, and camels. All of these animals belong to a mixed race of champion milk makers known as ruminants, who share some distinct anatomical features: a three- or four-sectioned stomach and a mouth equipped with an upper &#x201c;dental pad&#x201d; instead of teeth. It&#x2019;s these unique body parts&#x2014;which serve to harvest and ferment plants&#x2014;that make the lactating ruminant a virtual processing plant on legs, able to turn whole fields of green into butter�fat-laden milk. Ruminant milk varies as much as the mothers that produce it. A ewe, for example, will give milk with twice the fat content of cow&#x2019;s milk; goat&#x2019;s milk has fat molecules that are smaller and more digestible, but it lacks carotene so goat butter is white; milk from a yak has less milk sugar (lactose) and more protein than cow&#x2019;s milk; camel&#x2019;s milk is similar to goat&#x2019;s milk in composition, but it can have up to three times as much vitamin C; and the milk of water buffalo has 100 percent more fat than cow&#x2019;s milk.<br><br> Cheese makers have long used the idiosyncrasies in different animal milks to their advantage&#x2014;think of all the choices in the cheese aisle between cow, goat, sheep, and water buffalo products. But for most butter makers, cow&#x2019;s milk is still sine qua non. Delicious butters made from other ruminant milks can be found around the world (one of my favorites was from a water buffalo in India)&#x2014;but the practical fact is that cows are the most generous, manageable, and affordable source of butterfat, especially in these modern times. The average yield of milk from a cow in the fourteenth century was between 140 to 170 gallons per season; the twenty-first-century Holstein cow now gives an average of 2,574 gallons per lactation. Medieval milk yield records were so low partly because calves got their fair share and because the cows were hand-milked in the field by dairymaids, not by machine. But the greater reason is that cattle were valued primarily for their labor in the fields and only incidentally as a source of milk. They were neither fed nor bred for high milk production, as they have been over the past two centuries. Generations of modern cows have been subject to efficient mechanical or robotic milking equipment, extended lactating periods, and synthetic hormones to increase their milk output.<br><br> Abundance, however, is no guarantee of quality. Butter makers continually monitor their cream supply for flaws, knowing full well that it&#x2019;s a capricious commodity. Like milk, it expresses the history of ever-changing conditions, both internal and external to the animal, and each batch of churned cream translates this history to the butter it becomes, affecting the butter&#x2019;s color, density, richness, tanginess, sweetness, and flavor nuances.<br><br> Professional butter makers will read, sniff, and measure these subtle variations and adapt their methods accordingly (as described in chapter 8), but the cream&#x2019;s inherent chemical and physical nuances, or lack thereof, can make the difference between a ho-hum butter and a remarkable one. To some extent, when you taste a great butter, you&#x2019;re savoring the sensitive workings of a hidden ecosystem operating inside every milk-making ruminant. This internal apparatus is the precursor to all that happens in the creamery. Like most things in nature, it&#x2019;s ingenious and intricate. In essence, to give butterfat, a ruminating mother plays host to a long procession of digestive ploys whereby anatomy meets botany in order to rearrange chemistry.<br><br> THE CREAM-RICH MILK THAT a pastured cow deposits twice a day in the milking parlor begins in the grassy sward beyond her barn home, where she&#x2019;ll typically dine on different kinds of cultivated grasses and legumes, as well as on some wild flowers. If her belly is feeling a little off that day, she might also nibble on certain herbs or shrubs if they&#x2019;re available; cows will self-medicate if given the remedial plant choice in the pasture. While grazing, if a cow spies a clump of grass&#x2014;or if she&#x2019;s lucky, a tasty patch of clover&#x2014;she uses her tongue to lasso a bunch of it. She tears the greens free by pinching them between her bottom teeth and a thick upper gum area&#x2014;the dental pad referred to earlier. (If she could smile broadly, you&#x2019;d see that she has no top front teeth, just a dark leathery band.) Inside her mouth, the grass gets moistened with saliva and then swallowed&#x2014;but only temporarily. This wet grassy mixture stored in the rumen, the first compartment of her stomach, will eventually return to her mouth. But first she&#x2019;ll continue dining on the pasture for about an hour, lopping off and swallowing vegetation. If the grass is soft and high, she can take in a hefty eighty to ninety pounds of fresh plant matter in that time.<br><br> Then our gal will find a nice place to settle down, often reclining near others in the herd and almost always listing toward her left side.

He's great at homespun metaphor, but behind those catchy phrases is a reservoir of financial acumen that's generally considered the best of his generation. For example, in an essay on CEO stock options, he writes, "Negotiating with one's self seldom produces a barroom brawl." This is his way of saying that an executive who can give himself compensation totally disproportionate to his performance surely will. There are uncountable gems of financial wisdom to be harvested from these essays, taken from the annual reports he writes for Berkshire Hathaway, his holding company. Just to pick one more, here's a now-famous line about those he competes with when making stock-market investments: "What could be more advantageous in an intellectual contest--whether it be chess, bridge, or stock selection--than to have opponents who have been taught that thinking is a waste of energy?"<p> While Buffett has a policy of seldom commenting on stocks he owns--he feels public pronouncements will only lead to the public's expectation of more public pronouncements, and he likes to keep his cards close to his vest--he loves to discuss the principles behind his investments. These come primarily from Ben Graham, under whom Buffett studied at Columbia University and for whom he worked in the 1950s. First among them is the idea that price is what you pay and value is what you get--and if you're a smart investor, the first will always be less than the second. In that sense, the value of the lessons learned from Buffett's <i>Essays</i> could be far greater than the book's price. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p>The book has garnered widespread critical acclaim from broad cross sections of readers; has been translated into numerous languages; and has been designated as a top investment/business book by numerous reviewers ranging from CNN to JP Morgan to the Motley Fool (number 2 investment book of all time!).

It was a warm, late-spring day, and the kids were out on recess. They were busy playing tag and chasing balls and just doing what kids do best -- running around. I stopped to take a swig of water from my bottle, and as I watched the flurry of little legs, I was reminded once again why I love to watch kids run. Every one of them had perfect running form: a nice lean, a great stride opening up behind them, heels high in the air, relaxed arm swing and shoulders. They had it all! One of my biggest desires as a coach is to help adults learn to run like they did as kids. It's such a natural movement when kids do it. It looks so effortless and joyful. Many books about running tell you to just go out and run like you did as a kid. There's just one problem with that suggestion: You don't have the same body today that you did back then. If you do, I'd like you to be my teacher.<br><br>So why don't adults run like kids, with that same ease and joyfulness? After running for thirty years and working with thousands of runners, I'd have to say that the two biggest factors are stress and tension. I can speak for myself, and maybe you can relate. Since I left the sixth grade, I have put my body through a wide range of physical and emotional stresses, such as tightening my shoulders when I'm worried, slouching all day at my desk, holding tension in my neck while driving -- the list is endless. Individually, these might not sound like a big deal, but when you add them all up over a lifetime, they have a major cumulative effect on how you move. I've also done a few radical things that have taken a bit more of a toll on my body, like skiing off cliffs and doing face plants while skateboarding. As Carolyn Myss, author of <i>Anatomy of the Spirit,</i> would say, "Your biography becomes your biology." With all of this abuse stored in my body, I'd be hard-pressed to run like I did as a kid. The good news is that for anyone with a little patience and perseverance, it is possible to get back to that state.<br><br>There are over 24 million runners in the United States alone. But get this. It is estimated that 65% of all runners incur at least one injury a year that interrupts their training. That means that 15.6 million people will get injured this year from running. No wonder people have a love/hate relationship with running. It's one of the most accessible and inexpensive ways to stay in shape, yet it poses a danger that is cautioned in articles, books, and doctors' offices everywhere. Most people treat injury as part of the sport and learn to accept that it will happen sooner or later: "I'll deal with it when it happens." It's the same line I get when I ask people in the San Francisco Bay area if they worry about earthquakes.<br><br>The conclusion I've come to after teaching countless runners is that <i>running does not hurt your body.</i> Let me repeat that -- and you can read my lips -- <i>running does not hurt your body.</i> It's the <i>way</i> you run that does the damage and causes pain.<br><br>When Adriane, 42, came to me, she was caught in a back-and-forth cycle of training hard to get into good condition, then getting injured and having to lay off for a couple of weeks, then starting all over again. She thought it was the right thing to constantly train fast and strength-train to improve her times in the marathon. But she was not making any forward progress because of the nagging injuries and her own internal pressure to keep increasing her weekly race-training schedule. With the ChiRunning technique, she learned how to relax while running and, more important, in the other areas of her life. She realized that she was not only a driven runner, she was a driven person. Without all the tension in her body, she stopped injuring herself while running, and her training took on a new level of consistency.<br><br>Jerry, a 59-year-old runner, was just about to give up running when he came to his first ChiRunning class. He had been a runner for forty years, and after having knee surgery, he had begun to feel the same old aches and pains creeping into his runs that had prompted the <br><br>surgery. He was afraid that if he continued running, he would ruin his knees and live in pain for the rest of his life. It has now been two years since his first class, and he is running regularly -- including an hour and a half on steep trails once a week -- and looking forward to many more years of pleasurable running. In fact, he wrote to me recently, thrilled that he had finished first in his age group in a local race, something he had never dreamed of even before his surgery.<br><br>Carmen, 35, was a beginning runner and insecure about her ability to do anything well physically. After taking a series of three ChiRunning classes, she happened to call as my wife, Katherine, and I were reviewing her class on video. Katherine remarked on how good Carmen looked in the film and asked her how she liked the class. "Oh, it simply changed my life" was the reply. "For the first time in my life, I feel like I can be good at a sport."<br><br>From beginners to competitors to the forty-plus crowd who are afraid of injuring themselves as they get older, ChiRunning is meeting the needs of runners with an approach that builds a healthy body instead of breaking it down from misuse or overuse.<br><br><b>ChiRunning Versus Power Running</b><br><br>The current paradigm of running form and injury prevention is founded in muscle strength. It is basically built around three principles: (1) If you want to run faster, you need to build stronger leg muscles. (2) If you want to run longer, you need to build stronger leg muscles. (3) If you want to avoid or recover from injuries, you need to build stronger leg muscles. Do you see a theme developing here? It's all dependent on muscles to get the job done, and the leg muscles are given the bulk of the responsibility to make it all happen. That's a lot of responsibility and, according to T'ai Chi principles, a very unbalanced way to move your body. The problem with strength training is that it doesn't get to the root of the most common cause of injury: poor running form. Most runners want to run either longer or faster at some point in their running career, but without good running form, added distance will only lengthen the time you are running improperly and increase your odds of getting hurt. If you try to add speed with improper running form, you are magnifying the poor biomechanical habits that could cause injury. So, the best place to build a good foundation is in getting your running motion smooth, relaxed, and efficient. Then you can add distance or speed without risking injury.<br><br>This book presents an alternative to what we call power running. ChiRunning is based on the centuries-old principle from T'ai Chi that states, <i>Less is more.</i> Getting back to that childhood way of running doesn't come from building bigger muscles, it comes from relaxing muscles, opening tight joints, and using gravity to do the work instead of pushing and forcing your body to move in ways that can do it harm. Most runners, especially those over 35, will tell you that running can keep you in good shape but it's hard on your body. I developed ChiRunning because I really didn't believe that pounding and injury should be a part of running. I just didn't buy it.<br><br>I've never considered myself a great runner. I liked to run as a kid, but I shied away from it in high school because, to tell you the truth, I was intimidated by the caliber of our track-team members, most of whom could run a hundred-yard dash in under 10 seconds and a quarter mile in under a minute. In an inner-city high school with 3,600 students, the coaches could basically pick from the cream of the crop, and I hardly considered myself even potential cream. So I joined the ski club and partied instead. In fact, I signed up to take gymnastics, because every Wednesday the gym classes had to run around a nearby lake, and I couldn't imagine making myself run for twelve minutes without stopping.<br><br>Don't get me wrong. I've always loved sports, and I love to learn new things with my body. Whenever I wanted to take on a new sport, I would apply another love of mine -- figuring out how things work. As far back as I can remember, I've always had questions running through my mind, like: "Why does a clock tick?" or "What kind of machine wraps a stick of butter?" As a kid, I loved taking things apart to see what made them do what they did, then I'd try to put them back together again. Although I had a lifetime average of about 75% on the reassembly, I always figured out how they worked.<br><br>This is what I did with skiing, rock climbing, and sailing. I broke each sport down into its elemental parts, which would then give me a physical understanding of how to put it all together into a unified movement. As I found myself improving, I would get more excited and consequentially focus even more. My learning was driven by my passion, so my hours spent practicing would fly by. I loved learning new body skills.<br><br>In my early twenties, when I took up running, I approached it in much the same way. I began running regularly in 1971, when I got drafted into the army. Running around the army base at an easy pace was very relaxing for my body and helped to settle my mind. This was the first time I had used a sport for more than physical fitness: I wasn't into being in the army, so I used running to escape the barracks and explore. After doing an eighteen-week stint with Uncle Sam, I was graciously given an honorable discharge, but not before discovering a new favorite pastime.<br><br>When I was a young adult, my curiosity about how things worked extended into those unseen forces out of which the physical world springs forth. I was no longer satisfied with only understanding the <i>how</i>, I wanted to know <i>why</i> they worked. I always came away with a sense that there was more going on than I was seeing. For lack of a better term, I call it the invisible world, and my curiosity about it is still the driving force behind my approach to life. It eventually led me to the study of T'ai Chi and using chi in my running.<br><br>The same year I started running, I began my investigation of the invisible by practicing long hours of meditation with a teacher from India. The most important knowledge I gained was how to quiet my mind so I could listen to my body. As my meditation practice began to spill into my running, my running became more and more an exploration of my own physical nature and the energies powering it.<br><br>Fast-forward to 1991. Over a period of twenty years, my running and my exploration of the invisible had become increasingly intertwined. I began running longer and longer distances as a means of exploring the potential of my body, which is what led me to the sport of ultramarathon running (distances longer than 26.2 miles). In 1995 I ran my first race, a fifty-miler in Boulder, Colorado. Since then I have completed thirty-four ultramarathons, winning my age group in fourteen of them and placing in the top three in my age group in all but one. The distances I have raced are 50K (31 miles), 50 miles, 100K (62 miles), and 100 miles. In 2002 I ran my first marathon (the Big Sur International Marathon), winning my age group in a time of 3:04, which I was very pleased with, considering there's about a thousand feet of vertical gain on the course.<br><br>Now, I just have to say right here, the ChiRunning technique is not about running super-long distances. I have chosen ultradistance running as a way to learn about my body, but I don't necessarily recommend it for everyone. If you are so inclined, ChiRunning certainly makes distance running more enjoyable, but even more important, it represents a way to move your body by using mental focus and relaxation instead of muscle power. In this book you will learn about the principle of "Form, Distance, and Speed," which means that you start by building a foundation of correct running form. As your foundation gets stronger, your body will be able to handle more distance. Then speed becomes a by-product of good technique practiced over increased distance, not something dependent on the size and strength of your muscles. Ultimately, you're not working to build distance and speed, you're working to build <i>presence</i>, and that can happen at any distance or speed.<br><br>When I first started running ultras, they were hard work. Along the way I had bouts with aches and pains, which I tried to approach with a positive attitude, telling myself, "If you can get this right, you might not have this pain again." At one point in my training, I had a knee pain that would start about twenty miles into my long run. But I never blamed the running for injuring my body. Instead, I took full responsibility by always trying to figure out how my form was causing my knees to hurt. I assumed that it was a matter of making the right correction, and I let that premise guide me in my trial-and-error research.<br><br>In 1997 my eyes were opened to a whole new realm when I met Zhu Xilin, a T'ai Chi master from China who introduced me to the concept of moving from one's center and letting the arms and legs follow. His way of moving his body looked both effortless and powerful. Needless to say, adapting this idea to my running was a huge draw for me.<br><br>T'ai Chi owes its origins to the study of animal movements. According to the Chinese, chi (pronounced <i>chee</i>) is the energy force that animates all things. It runs through a system of meridians that distribute this energy to all parts of your body. By practicing mental focus and relaxation, one can learn to sense and direct this subtle energy through the system of movements and exercises known as T'ai Chi. This concept is downplayed by Western medicine because chi cannot be detected with measuring instruments and cannot be supported by the scientific method. The interesting part about chi is that it will move through your body whether you believe in it or not, because if it weren't running through you, you'd be dead. Fair enough?<br><br>The current trend in sports training toward using one's core muscles is just starting to scratch the surface of knowledge the Chinese have been developing for three thousand years. One of the things T'ai Chi teaches us is to direct movement from points along our spine; thus it can originate from the center line of your body and not from the peripheral. Observation of Nature teaches us that the strength of a tree lies in its trunk, not in the branches and leaves. Why should the human body be any different? Why do you think the area of your body that houses all your vital organs is called your trunk? Are we nodding yet?<br><br>Look at the movement of a cheetah, the fastest land animal on earth. It doesn't have big strong legs like a tiger. It has skinny legs like a greyhound. So how does it go so fast? The secret lies in its spine, which is where most of its chi energy is contained. When a cheetah runs, you can see that its source of power comes from the spine and not the legs.<br><br>For your legs to be powered by the chi energy coming through the spine, they need to be very relaxed. Master Zhu would constantly tell me to keep my spine straight but relax the rest of my body and let the chi flow through "like water through a pipe." A major lightbulb went off in my head when it occurred to me that this idea could be applied to running.<br><br>I started to grasp the idea of moving my body from its center and letting my legs be pulled along for the ride. But relaxing my arms and legs while running only uncovered the next problem in the chain -- the need to relax my shoulders and hips. Once I became adept at relaxing, I could feel how much po...</p><h2>The NHL -- 100 Years in Pictures and Stories</h2><p><p> In <i>The NHL -- 100 Years in Pictures and Stories</i>, authors Ryan Dixon and Bob Duff recount the events that have shaped the league from its madcap early years all the way to the 30-team elite professional sport that it is today. </p><p> From game changing decisions like allowing goalies to wear masks, to jaw-dropping performances like Maurice Richard's 50 goals in 50 games, there is no stone left unturned. </p><p> Some of the events you'll read about in <i>The NHL -- 100 Years in Pictures and Stories</i>: </p><p></p><ul> <li> 1945: Maurice Richard scores 50 goals in 50 games </li> <li> 1951: Bill Barilko scores his last goal -- a Cup winner </li> <li> 1958: Willie O'Ree breaks the NHL's color barrier </li> <li> 1959: Jacques Plante starts to wear a mask </li> <li> 1960: Montreal Canadiens first ever five-time Cup champs </li> <li> 1966: Bobby Hull breaks Richard's 50 goal record </li> <li> 1971: Phil Esposito scores 76 goals </li> <li> 1980: Peter Stastny defects to the NHL </li> <li> 1981: Wayne Gretzky scores 50 goals in 39 games </li> <li> 1989: First Russians play in the NHL </li> <li> 1998: NHL players go to the Olympics </li> <li> 2003: NHL takes the game outside </li> <li> 2005: NHL installs shootout </li> <li> 2015: Carey Price becomes first goalie to win four major awards. </li> </ul><p></p><p> With more than 200 images, hundreds of star players and dozens of artifacts from the Hockey Hall of Fame, <i>The NHL -- 100 Years in Pictures and Stories</i> is the definitive guide to the NHL's centennial celebration. </p></p><p><p> Bob Duff is a veteran sports writer who has covered the Stanley Cup Final, World Cup of Hockey, Super Bowl and the World Series, among other major sporting events, for a variety of news outlets, including: MSNBC.com, the <i>Windsor Star</i> and <i>The Hockey News</i>.

Some of the more insipid stomach-turners being plunked down before B &amp; B guests include coconut coffee cake (which calls for a box of yellow cake mix, shredded coconut, crushed pineapple and a can of condensed cheddar-cheese soup) and Manhattan clam-chowder eggs (add canned, condensed Manhattan clam chowder to beaten eggs and scramble).

"And they are dangerous." </p><br><p>Beginning with a traditional Native oral story, King weaves his way through literature and history, religion and politics, popular culture and social protest, gracefully elucidating North America's relationship with its Native peoples. </p><br><p>Native culture has deep ties to storytelling, and yet no other North American culture has been the subject of more erroneous stories. The Indian of fact, as King says, bears little resemblance to the literary Indian, the dying Indian, the construct so powerfully and often destructively projected by White North America. With keen perception and wit, King illustrates that stories are the key to, and only hope for, human understanding. He compels us to listen well. </p></p><p>&#34;Stories are wondrous things. And they are dangerous.&#34; In The Truth About Stories, Native novelist and scholar Thomas King explores how stories shape who we are and how we understand and interact with other people. From creation stories to personal experiences, historical anecdotes to social injustices, racist propaganda to works of contemporary Native literature, King probes Native culture&#39;s deep ties to storytelling. With wry humor, King deftly weaves events from his own life as a child in California, an academic in Canada, and a Native North American with a wide-ranging discussion of stories told by and about Indians. So many stories have been told about Indians, King comments, that &#34;there is no reason for the Indian to be real. The Indian simply has to exist in our imaginations.&#34; That imaginative Indian that North Americans hold dear has been challenged by Native writers - N. Scott Momaday, Leslie Marmon Silko, Louis Owens, Robert Alexie, and others - who provide alternative narratives of the Native experience that question, create a present, and imagine a future. King reminds the reader, Native and non-Native, that storytelling carries with it social and moral responsibilties. &#34;Don&#39;t say in the years to come that you would have lived your life differently if only you had heard this story. You&#39;ve heard it now.&#34;Illuminates the relationship between storytelling and the Native North American experience.</p><h2>Ninth Witness (A. D.

Includes historical maps and a discussion guide for individual or group study.</p><p>It is a time of great danger and suffering . . . yet the candle of hope still gleams. <p>The census riots are barely past. Bands of Zealots roam the canyons. Anguished shrieks echo against the hillsides of Nazareth as Rome crushes the last pockets of Jewish resistance. Herod the Butcher King is dead, but his cruel son, Antipas, now reigns in the Galil. Nine-year-old Jude and six-year-old Kerah watch as their father, Judah the Zealot, the hero of the Galil, hangs on a Roman cross. His dying whisper to Jude? "Take your sister to Jerusalem." But the journey is long and dangerous . . . especially for two small children and an old woman. </p><p>Zachariah, Elisheba, and young Yochanan watch the compelling signs in the heavens and ponder what they mean.

Traditionally, the sauce is made with a mortar and pestle.

The other ingredients are then mixed into the mayonnaise.<br>I find it much easier to be less traditional and make the sauce in a blender or food processor.

When she emerged from captivity in 2006, having endured one of the longest abductions in recent history, her childhood had gone. in 3,096 Days Natascha tells her amazing story for the first time: her difficult childhood, what happened exactly on that fateful morning when she was on her way to school, her long imprisonment in a five-square-metre dungeon, and the physical and mental abuse she suffered from her abductor, Wolfgang Priklopil - who committed suicide by throwing himself under a train on the day she managed to make her escape. 3,096 Days is ultimately a story about the triumph of the human spirit. It describes how, in a situation of almost unbearable hopelessness, she learned how to manipulate her captor.

On this lonely stretch of Louisiana highway, surrounded by tupelo trees and moss-covered cypress, few cars passed us, and the ones that did flew by without slowing down, tossing leaves in their wake. They couldn't see the shaggy black horse with eyes like hot coals, walking along the road without reins or bit or saddle. They couldn't see the figures on its back, the pale-haired girl and the dark, beautiful prince behind her, his arms around her waist. Mortals were blind to the world of Faery, a world I was a part of now, whether I'd asked for it or not.<br><br>"What are you afraid of?" a deep voice murmured in my ear, sending a shiver up my spine. Even in the humid swamps of Louisiana, the Winter prince radiated cold, and his breath was wonderfully cool against my skin.<br><br>I peered at him over my shoulder. "What do you mean?"<br><br>Ash, prince of the Unseelie Court, met my gaze, silver eyes gleaming in the twilight. Officially, he was no longer a prince. Queen Mab had exiled him from the Nevernever after he refused to renounce his love for the half-human daughter of Oberon, the Summer King. My father. Summer and Winter were supposed to be enemies. We were not supposed to cooperate, we were not supposed to go on quests together and, most important, we were not supposed to fall in love.<br><br>But we had, and now Ash was here, with me. We were exiles, and the trods&#x2014;the paths into Faery&#x2014;were closed to us forever, but I didn't care. I wasn't planning to ever go back.<br><br>"You're nervous." Ash's hand stroked the back of my head, brushing the hair from my neck, making me shiver. "I can feel it. You have this anxious, flickering aura all around you, and it's driving me a little nuts, being this close. What's wrong?"<br><br>I should've known. There was no hiding what I felt from Ash, or any faery for that matter. Their magic, their glamour, came from human dreams and emotions. So Ash could sense what I was feeling without even trying. "Sorry," I told him. "I guess I am a little nervous."<br><br>"Why?"<br><br>"Why? I've been gone almost a year. Mom will hit the roof when she sees me." My stomach squirmed as I imagined the reunion: the tears, the angry relief, the inevitable questions. "They didn't hear anything from me while I was in Faery." I sighed, gazing up the road to where the stretch of pavement melted into the darkness. "What am I going to tell them? How will I even begin to explain?"<br><br>The tatter-colt snorted and pinned its ears at a truck that roared by, passing uncomfortably close. I couldn't be sure, but it looked like Luke's battered old Ford, rattling down the road and vanishing around a curve. If it was my stepdad, he definitely wouldn't have seen us; he'd had a hard time remembering my name even when I'd lived in the same house.<br><br>"You tell them the truth," Ash said, startling me. I wasn't expecting him to answer. "From the beginning. Either they accept it, or they don't, but you can't hide who you are, especially from your family. Best to get it over with&#x2014;we can deal with whatever happens after."<br><br>His candor surprised me. I was still getting used to this new Ash, this faery who talked and smiled instead of hiding behind an icy wall of indifference. Ever since we were banished from the Nevernever, he'd been more open, less brooding and angst-ridden, as if a huge weight had been lifted from his shoulders. True, he was still quiet and solemn by anyone's standards, but for the first time, I felt I was finally getting a glimpse of the Ash I knew was there all along.<br><br>"But what if they <em>can't </em>deal with it?" I muttered, voicing the concern that had been plaguing me all morning. "What if they see what I am and freak out? What if they don't... want me anymore?"<br><br>I trailed off at the end, knowing I sounded like a sullen five-year-old. But Ash's hold on me tightened, and he pulled me closer against him.<br><br>"Then you'll be an orphan, just like me," he said. "And we'll find a way to get by." His lips brushed against my ear, tying my stomach into about a dozen knots. "Together."<br><br>My breath hitched, and I turned my head to kiss him, reaching back to run my hand through his silky dark hair.<br><br>The tatter-colt snorted and bucked midstep, not enough to throw me off, but enough to bounce me a few inches straight up. I snatched wildly for its mane as Ash grabbed my waist, keeping me from falling off. Heart pounding, I shot a glare between the tatter-colt's ears, resisting the urge to kick it in the ribs and give it another excuse to buck me off. It raised its head and glared back at us, eyes glowing crimson, disgust written plainly on its equine face.<br><br>I wrinkled my nose at it. "Oh, excuse me, are we making you uncomfortable?" I asked sarcastically, and it snorted. "Fine. We'll behave."<br><br>Ash chuckled but didn't attempt to pull me back. I sighed and gazed at the road over the colt's bobbing head, looking for familiar landmarks. My heart leaped when I saw a rusty van sitting in the trees off the side of the road, so ancient and corroded a tree had grown through the roof. It had been there for as long as I could remember, and I saw it every day on the bus to and from school. It always told me when I was nearly home.<br><br>It seemed so long ago, now&#x2014;a lifetime ago&#x2014;that I'd sat on the bus with my friend Robbie, when all I had to worry about was grades and homework and getting my driver's permit. So much had changed; it would feel strange returning to school and my old, mundane life like nothing had happened. "I'll probably have to repeat a year," I sighed, and felt Ash's puzzled gaze on my neck. Of course, being an immortal faery, he didn't have to worry about school and licenses and&#x2014;<br><br>I stopped as reality seemed to descend on me all at once. My time in the Nevernever was like a dream, hazy and ethereal, but we were back in the real world now. Where I had to worry about homework and grades and getting into college. I'd wanted to get a summer job and save up for a car. I'd wanted to attend ITT Tech after high school, maybe move to the Baton Rouge or New Orleans campuses when I graduated. Could I still do that? Even after everything that happened? And where would a dark, exiled faery prince fit into all of this?<br><br>"What is it?" Ash's breath tickled the back of my ear, making me shiver.<br><br>I took a deep breath. "How is this going to work, Ash?" I half turned to face him. "Where will we be a year from now, two years from now? I can't stay here forever&#x2014;sooner or later, I'm going to have to get on with my life. School, work, college someday..." I broke off and looked down at my hands. "I have to move on eventually, but I don't want to do any of those things without you."<br><br>"I've been thinking about that," Ash replied. I glanced up at him, and he surprised me with a brief smile. "You have your whole life ahead of you. It makes sense that you should plan for the future. And I figure, Goodfellow pretended to be mortal for sixteen years. There's no reason I can't do the same."<br><br>I blinked at him. "Really?"<br><br>He touched my cheek softly, his eyes intense as they gazed into mine. "You might have to teach me a little about the human world, but I'm willing to learn if it means being close to you." He smiled again, a wry quirk of his lips. "I'm sure I can adapt to 'being human,' if I must. If you want me to attend classes as a student, I can do that. If you want to move to a large city to pursue your dreams, I will follow. And if, someday, you wish to be married in a white gown and make this official in human eyes, I'm willing to do that, too." He leaned in, close enough for me to see my reflection in his silver gaze. "For better or worse, I'm afraid you're stuck with me now."<br><br>I felt breathless, not knowing what to say. I wanted to thank him, but those words didn't mean the same in faery terms. I wanted to lean in the rest of the way and kiss him, but the tatter-colt would probably throw me into the ditch if I tried. "Ash," I began, but was saved a response as the tatter-colt abruptly came to a full stop at the end of a long gravel driveway that stretched away over a short rise. A familiar green mailbox balanced precariously on its post at the end of the drive, faded with age and time, but I had no trouble reading it, even in the darkness.<br><br><em>Chase. 14202</em><br><br>My heart stood still. I was home.<br><br>I slid off the tatter-colt's back and stumbled as I hit the ground, my legs feeling weird and shaky after being on horseback for so long. Ash dismounted with ease, murmuring something to the tatter-colt, which snorted, threw up its head and bounded into the darkness. In seconds, it had disappeared.<br><br>I gazed up the long gravel road, my heart pounding in my chest. Home and family waited just beyond that rise: the old green farmhouse with paint peeling off the wood, the pig barns out back through the mud, Luke's truck and Mom's station wagon in the driveway.<br><br>Ash moved up beside me, making no noise on the rocks. "Are you ready?"<br><br>No, I wasn't. I peered into the darkness where the tatter-colt had vanished instead. "What happened to our ride?" I asked, to distract myself from what I had to do. "What did you say to it?"<br><br>"I told him the favor has been paid and that we're even now." For some reason, this seemed to amuse him; he gazed after the colt with a faint smile on his lips. "It appears I can't order them around like I used to. I'll have to rely on calling in favors from now on."<br><br>"Is that bad?"<br><br>The smile twitched into a smirk. "A lot of people owe me." When I still hesitated, he nodded toward the driveway. "Go on. Your family is waiting."<br><br>"What about you?"<br><br>"It's probably better if you go alone this time." A flicker of regret passed through his eyes, and he gave me a pained smile. "I don't think your brother would be happy to see me again."<br><br>"But&#x2014;"<br><br>"I'll be close." He reached out and tucked a strand of hair behind my ears. "Promise."<br><br>I sighed and gazed up the driveway once more. "All right," I muttered, steeling myself for the inevitable. "Here goes nothing."<br><br>I took three steps, feeling the gravel crunch under my feet, and glanced over my shoulder. The empty road mocked me, the breeze stirring up leaves in the spot Ash had been. <em>Typical faery. </em>I shook my head and continued my solitary trek up the driveway.<br><br>It wasn't long before I reached the top of the rise, and there, in all its rustic glory, was the house I'd lived in for ten years. I could see lights on in the window, and my family moving about in the kitchen. There was Mom's slender frame, bent over the sink, and Luke in his faded overalls, putting a stack of dirty plates on the counter. And if I squinted hard enough, I could just see the top of Ethan's curly head, poking over the kitchen table.<br><br>Tears pricked my eyes. After a year of being away, fighting faeries, discovering who I was, cheating death more times than I cared to remember, I was finally home.<br><br>"Isn't that precious," a voice hissed.<br><br>I spun, looking around wildly.<br><br>"Up here, princess."<br><br>I looked straight up, and my vision was filled with a thin, shimmering net an instant before it struck me and sent me tumbling back. Cursing, I thrashed and tore at the threads, trying to rip through the flimsy barrier. Stinging pain made me gasp. Blood streamed down my hands, and I squinted at the threads. The net was actually made of fine, flexible wire, and my struggles had sliced my fingers open.<br><br></p><h2>A Killing Frost (D.I.

He recently received a Silver Medal from the Society of Illustrators, NY.Diana, summoned from her big home high on a hill, was at the Manor House when Trixie arrived. They rushed up the stairs to the attic, climbed through the trap door to the cubbyhole, put the key and the mysterious tag on top of an old trunk, and started to explore.<br>They looked under and around everything in the room: broken old ladders, discarded light fixtures, a three-legged hobby horse, storm windows, screens that needed repairing, discarded clothing packed in boxes. Trixie even rummaged through the boxes of clothing. They found an old chest filled with checkers and chess men, but the key with the strange figures didn&#x2019;t fit the keyhole.<br>They did find some very old toys that had been put up high in the rafters. There was an old Punch and Judy theater with Punch, quite tattered and worn, leaning over the door holding his big stick. There was a Sleeping Beauty doll minus her long golden hair. There were three plaster figures of the seven dwarfs.<br>&#x201c;We can paint these and dress them in some new clothes,&#x201d; Honey said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be as good as new.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s stop hunting for anything that key fits,&#x201d; Diana said. &#x201c;We could hunt from now until the Fourth of July and never find it.

Here, let&#x2019;s turn to the puzzle pages.&#x201d;<br>The girls sat on the floor inside the cubbyhole, the bound magazines in their laps.<br>&#x201c;This one is way back in 1884,&#x201d; Diana said, opening the red cloth-bound book.<br>&#x201c;Heavens, that was before the United States was born,&#x201d; Trixie said.<br>&#x201c;Not quite,&#x201d; Honey laughed. &#x201c;I thought you were better in history than math.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;See if you can answer this one, if you&#x2019;re so smart,&#x201d; Trixie said, her face red. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an easy charade, or so it says.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not any of the puzzles in <i>St. Nicholas</i> were easy,&#x201d; Diana said. &#x201c;I guess people were smarter then.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Try this anyway,&#x201d; Trixie said.<br>&#x201c;Men hunt my <i>first,</i> then <i>second</i> my <i>first</i> in order to obtain my <i>whole.&#x201d;</i><br>&#x201c;It must be something people hunt,&#x201d; Honey said.

Isn&#x2019;t there something there?&#x201d;<br>Trixie reached, almost fell off the ladder, brought out an old broken pull toy. Her face fell. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s not another thing here,&#x201d; she said and climbed down.<br>Together the girls moved out all the old screens and storm windows, hunted over every inch of floor they had covered before, looked through the boxes of old clothes again till there was only one thing left, a chest that stood under the window in the closet next to the chimney.<br>&#x201c;We hunted through that before, Trixie,&#x201d; Diana said.<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hunt again,&#x201d; Honey cried, and she and Trixie drew out armload after armload of clothes long packed in moth balls.<br>When she reached the bottom of the chest Trixie was so exasperated and disappointed she felt like crying. She slammed down the lid of the old chest and kicked it so hard it banged against the chimney, loosening several bricks that fell to the floor.<br>&#x201c;Jeepers, I&#x2019;m sorry, Honey,&#x201d; Trixie said. &#x201c;Your mother will think this is terrible.&#x201d; She picked up a brick, started to replace it in the chimney, then stopped. Her eyes grew as round as robins&#x2019; eggs. &#x201c;Will you look at this?&#x201d; she asked Honey and Diana. They put their heads close to hers.<br>Back of where the bricks had been there was an open space, and tucked cozily inside it was an old doll&#x2019;s trunk. Dazed, Trixie pulled it out, put it on the floor, inserted the key in the lock, turned it, and all three girls fell to their knees to look.</p><h2>Dizzy &amp; Jimmy: My Life with James Dean: A Love Story</h2><p><p><em></em></p><em>A long time ago, when I was a young dancer in<br>New York City, I fell in love with Jimmy Dean<br>and he fell in love with me.</em><p></p><p>So begins this beguiling memoir of Liz "Dizzy" Sheridan's passionate yet ill-fated romance with the young, magnetic, soon-to-be-supernova James Dean. The year was 1951. Dean had recently arrived in Manhattan in search of Broadway stardom. Sheridan was a tall, graceful aspiring dancer. They met one rainy afternoon in the parlor of the Rehearsal Club, a chaperoned boardinghouse for young actresses -- and before long Dizzy and Jimmy were inseparable. Together they hunted for jobs, haunted all-night bars and diners, and gloried in the innocent rebellion of early-'50s bohemian New York. Dizzy Sheridan and James Dean were lovers; they lived together; as even ardent Dean fans may be surprised to learn, they were engaged to be married. But when Dean began to find success on the Broadway stage and then was lured to Hollywood, the couple parted amid tears and broken dreams -- dreams that would be dashed forever when Dean died in a car crash in 1955, not long after seeing Dizzy for the last time.</p><p><em>Dizzy &amp; Jimmy</em> marks the first time Liz Sheridan has written about this joyous yet ill-starred romance. She brings us closer than we have ever been to the vibrant young actor before he became a Hollywood icon, capturing his unstudied charm, his complicated psyche, the spontaneous delight he took from the world around him, and the passion he invested in his work and life. It is a journey that takes in many locales, from Dean's boyhood home in Fairmount, Indiana, to Sheridan's recuperative travels through the Caribbean after their breakup. But at its heart <em>Dizzy &amp; Jimmy</em> is the story of a love affair with Manhattan -- of nights spent stealing kisses in Times Square, sharing a walkup in the Hargrave Hotel, dancing after hours beneath the stars in Grand Central Station. And in Sheridan's bittersweet, embraceable telling, it becomes a story no reader, Dean fan or otherwise, will soon forget.</p></p><p>Liz Sheridan is perhaps best known today for her role as Jerry Seinfeld's mother, Helen, on the landmark television series <em>Seinfeld,</em> and as the eccentric neighbor Mrs. Ochmonek on <em>Alf.</em> She is a veteran stage actress with featured roles in eight Broadway shows. Married to jazz musician Dale Wales, Sheridan lives in Studio City, California.Sheridan, best known as Jerry Seinfeld's TV mother, reveals her love affair with James Dean in a brief book replete with moony dialogue, prescient remarks about Dean's driving habits and a 1950s New York setting. The effervescent Sheridan, known as Dizzy, was a dancer living in a theater district residence hall for aspiring actresses when she met the 21-year-old Dean, an Indiana farm boy who had come to New York via Hollywood. Their instant attraction was soon consummated. Sheridan portrays Dean as a sometimes corny romantic, who immediately began talking about being "together forever" and who needed "always to touch and be touched." While Dizzy managed to work, dancing in nightclubs all over New York or in summer stock musicals, Jimmy was either more unlucky or more choosy, and brooded over his disappointments. Though she touches on Dean's moody episodes and regular, unexplained disappearances, as well as his disclosure of a homosexual liaison with a California producer helpful to his career, Sheridan doesn't claim that her memoir is a complete account of Dean's New York years. (For example, there's no mention of his acceptance into the Actors Studio in November 1951.) When Dean was cast in a bound-for-Broadway production, he moved easily away from Sheridan. Dean got enthusiastic notices in See the Jaguar, although the play closed in a few days, and the affair never rekindled. Sheridan's feelings for Dean, her pain upon their separation and on his untimely death a few years later, are sweetly rendered and seem genuine, although the details are filtered though a romanticized lens.

Included: Lake Michigan and Sweden). From the politics of geocaching to the ups and downs of the contestants participating in the National Geographic Bee (which, according to Alex Trebek, should have its own prime-time show like the spelling bee), Jennings captures the excitement and wonder of places. <em>--Caley Anderson</em>Ken Jennings grew up in Seoul, South Korea, where he became a daily devotee of the quiz show&nbsp;<i>Jeopardy!</i>&nbsp;In 2004, he successfully auditioned for a spot on the show and went on an unprecedented seventy-four game victory streak worth $2.52 million.

Pekar, a man who has made a profession of chronicling the Kafkaesque absurdities of an ordinary life (if any life is ordinary) suddenly found himself incapacitated. But he had a better-than-average chance to beat cancer and he took it &#x2014; kicking, screaming, and complaining all the way. Pekar and Brabner draw on this and other trials to paint a portrait of a man beset with fears real and imagined &#x2014; who survives.</p><p>&#34;This is a story about a year when someone was sick, about a time when it seemed that the rest of the world was sick, too.&#34; So begins Harvey Pekar and Joyce Brabner&#39;s painful comic book autobiography centering on the year that they found out that Pekar had cancer; the year that also saw Operation Desert Shield turn into Operation Desert Storm. Drawing upon the many personal trials they faced, Pekar and Brabner create a portrait of a man beset with fears both real and imagined.Joined by his wife and collaborator Brabner and illustrator Stack, Pekar's (The New American Splendor Anthology) first book-length comics narrative is by turns amusing, frightening, moving and quietly entertaining. As always, Pekar's work records his apparently ordinary life as a hospital clerk in Cleveland while simultaneously capturing the epiphanic combination of mundanity and awkward, sporadic nobility of everyday life. In 1990, Pekar was diagnosed with lymphoma and needed chemotherapy. By the time the disease was discovered, the couple was in the midst of buying a house (a tremendous worry to Pekar, who fretted about both the money and corruptions of bourgeois creature comforts). Brabner, a self-described "comic book journalist," had to oversee both the new house and a sick and very difficult husband. Pekar's cancer treatment and suffering will take your breath away, but there's a happy ending; and the book (and their marriage) is distinguished by Brabner's great tenderness and determination in the middle of Pekar's medical nightmare. Stack's brisk and elegantly gestural black-and-white drawings wonderfully delineate this captivating story of love, community, recuperation and international friendship. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Quick-Fix Vegan: Healthy, Homestyle Meals in 30 Minutes or Less (Volume 4) (Quick-Fix Cooking)</h2><p>150 quick and easy vegan recipes all made in 30 minutes or less from a well-loved, best-selling author in the vegan community.<br><br>"Robertson cuts to the chase and puts together good food simply.

This second and concluding volume, The Hunted, 1942-1945, covers the period when the fortunes of the German Navy were completely reversed, and it suffered perhaps the most devastating defeat of any of the German forces.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>In unprecedented detail and drawing on sources never used before, Clay Blair continues the dramatic and authoritative story of the failures and fortunes of the German U-boat campaign against the United States and Great Britain. All the major patrols and sorties made by the Germans are described in detail and with considerable human interest: the Peleus and Laconia affairs; the capture at sea of U-505; the crisis of German command; the futile operations against the Americas; and the mounting and devastating losses that, in effect, entirely destroyed the German submarine service.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Amid the riveting accounts of battles at sea in Volume I, military historian Blair, who served on an American submarine in the Pacific against Japan, postulates that the German U-boat peril in the Atlantic has been "vastly overblown" in previously published histories and memoirs of that naval struggle, as well as in films. As a consequence, Blair writes, a false mythology about the effectiveness of U-boats has taken root, and in order to clearly and fully understand World War II, one must put the U-boat threat into proper perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Although neither volume is intended to be "technical" in nature, Blair does not neglect the scientific developments of the U-boat war. These include radar and radar detectors, active and passive sonar, Axis encoding machines and exotic Allied decoding machines, high-frequency direction finding (Huff Duff), Hedgehogs, depth charges, and sophisticated U-boat torpedoes. He describes how these devices worked and how they influenced the course of the naval battle. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The remarkable story of Hitler's U-Boat War has been one of the last World War II subjects without a conclusive treatment. Now, thanks to Clay Blair, this has been brilliantly remedied.</p><p>This mammoth book concludes the two-volume set that began with <i>The Hunters, 1939-1942</i>. If the first installment charted the rise of the U-boat, this one describes its downfall as the United States became fully engaged in the Second World War. A careful scholar, Blair never overstates the impact the U-boats played on the war's final outcome, even though they sank roughly 3,000 ships. He is, above all, comprehensive. Rather than a breezy overview, this book describes, spread out over nearly 900 pages (including 20 appendices!), almost every U-boat action in the second half of the war. Some readers will find this level of detail exhausting, but others will revel in it, and <i>The Hunted</i> is sure to be regarded as a standard in its field. <i>--John J. Miller</i>"There is no doubt that this is a magnificent piece of naval history, not only exhaustive but also very well written, with strong appeal to the general reader as well as to the specialist....A real heavyweight." <br>--John Keegan<br></p><h2>Digital Integrated Circuits: A Design Perspective</h2><p>Used.

A faithful reproduction of the McLoughlin Bros. edition from 1870, the original antique book was saved from the 1871 Chicago fire. In its magical pages, scenes of an old-fashioned Christmas come to life, complete with visions of sugar-plums and a jolly old St. Nicholas. Readers of all ages will join in the celebration of a nineteenth-century Christmas they won&#39;t soon forget.</p><p>Whose tiny faces are peeking out from Santa's golden sleigh? Yikes! It's two of Santa's elves who are Christmas Eve stowaways. Beloved illustrator Jan Brett's version of <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> lets these two mischievous elves add their rambunctious spirit to this familiar 1823 rhyming story. Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England. While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and "away they all flew like the down on a thistle." Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons. They also give us a window on the mansion's inhabitants, including the children watching Santa's departure in awe. A sugarplum of a Christmas story, just right for a reading before "a long winter's nap." (Click to see a sample spread. Illustrations �1998 by Jan Brett. Published by G.P.

In the title story, Levi demonstrates his unerringly tragic understanding of the fragility of the universe through the tale of a pensive astronomer, terrified by the possibility that a long-dormant star might explode and reduce the entire planet to vapor. This remarkable new collection affirms Italo Calvino's conviction that Levi was "one of the most important and gifted writers of our time."</p><p><p><strong>Primo Levi</strong> (1919&#x2013;1987) was an Italian chemist and writer, best known for his memoirs <em>If This Is a Man</em> and <em>The Periodic Table</em>.</p><p><strong>Ann Goldstein</strong>, the editor of <em>The Complete Works of Primo Levi</em> and the award-winning translator of Elena Ferrante&#x2019;s novels, is a former editor at <em>The New Yorker</em>.</p><p>Alessandra Bastagli is the translator of Primo Levi's stories in <em>A Tranquil Star</em> and his essays in <em>The Complete Works</em>. She lives in New York.</p>Primo Levi, the Italian Jewish chemist and writer who died 20 years ago, is best known for his 1959 memoir Survival in Auschwitz. But this new collection of stories -- all previously unpublished in English -- will surely surprise readers familiar with Levi as a "Holocaust writer" or even those who know the semi-autobiographical stories in The Periodic Table. A Tranquil Star is a cabinet of curiosities, in which the realistic pieces are ordinary compared to the array of fascinating items Levi has culled from his imagination of worlds beyond our own.<p>In "Bureau of Vital Statistics," for instance, a frustrated man reports to his office for what appears to be an ordinary clerical position, until we slowly realize that his job is to assign causes of death to people on Earth. In "Gladiators," a woman reluctantly agrees to join her boyfriend at a popular sporting event -- where the "sport" consists of pedestrians dueling against cars. "Knall" describes a consumer craze for a pocket-sized gadget that instantly and silently murders people, but only at point-blank range.</p><p>Each of these stories is only a few pages long, and perhaps it's best to reveal as little about them as possible, so as not to ruin the reader's delight upon discovering the moment when the surreal finally saturates the real.</p><p>For another writer, this sort of "punch line" approach to plot might become little more than a gimmick. But the cumulative effect of these stories -- each written in the same elegant, unpretentious prose that defined Levi's memoirs -- is to make one wonder about the prevailing philosophy that brought these many imagined worlds into a single mind. And as one reads, that philosophy becomes clear. In each story we are introduced to a twist on our world that is, on closer examination, not really a twist at all. The shocking elements of these stories are precisely the points where they correspond to our own world: the sick spectacle that we make of brutal violence, the casual possibility of murder based on whim, the systems of terror and war that knowingly set the causes of others' deaths.</p><p>As a collection of nearly all of Levi's previously untranslated fiction, this book does include the occasional tale in which inanity trumps insight.</p><p>But the most poignant stories here are those that deal with the act of writing itself, and in particular its failure to meet the expectation of immortality. As the narrator relates in "The Fugitive," about a poem that physically eludes its author's grasp, "To compose a poem that is worth reading and remembering is a gift of destiny: it happens to only a few people, without regard for rules or intentions, and to them it happens only a few times in their lives." Levi has been granted this gift of destiny, and American readers now have the gift of rediscovering it.</p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

Two young sisters describe the changes that occur in their backyard apple tree throughout the seasons of a year. The tree is bare and brown in winter, but spring brings two robins that build a nest and raise a family amid the apple blossoms. In summer, the robins fly off, the girls enjoy playing in the tree's shade, and the apples grow bigger and redder. Finally, in autumn, they pick apples and bake a delicious apple pie. Halpern's colorful collage illustrations perfectly complement the succinct text. Eschewing the use of backgrounds, she concentrates on the tree and the children, which results in crisp edges and an uncluttered appearance that will please young audiences. Appended with an explanation of pollination and a recipe for apple pie, this will make a perfect choice for fall story hours and primary science lessons. Pair with Gail Gibbons' <i>Seasons of Arnold's Apple Tree</i> (1984) for another perspective. <i>Kay Weisman</i>A simple nature story about an apple tree in winter, spring, summer, and fall. ``My sister and I have a tree that grows the best part of apple pie. Can you guess what that is? Apples!'' In winter, the tree is brown, but in spring, leaves grow and a robin nests in the branches. In the days that follow, buds, blossoms, bees, tiny apples, and mature fruit appear. In the final pages, the two girls (with help from adults) make and eat an apple pie. A recipe is included, as is information on how the bee pollinates the apple flower. Halpern uses soft greens, browns, and pinks in the cut- paper collages; careful shading, painting, and layering give the illustrations dimensionality, with the textured nest and marbled tree trunk especially effective. An appealing study for young children. (Picture book. 4-7) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It includes the highly influential pamphlet <i>Thoughts on Government</i> (1776); the "Report of a Constitution for Massachusetts," (1780) Adams's blueprint for what remains the world's oldest working political charter, and dozens of his characteristically frank and revealing personal letters, many to his "dearest friend" Abigail, extensive diary excerpts, and selected passages from his unfinished autobiography recalling his life during this period.

But these familiar images are only a small part of western history. From the arrival of the Navajos in the Southwest more than seven hundred years ago, to the first Spanish settlements in New Mexico in the late sixteenth century, to the large Mormon migration to the Great Salt Lake, to the tourists flocking to the neon landscape of modern Las Vegas, the complex story of the West stretches across centuries, embracing many voices and contrasting cultures. The West is in fact as varied as America itself. Indeed, to enlarge on Wallace Stegner's singular phrase, the West <em>is</em> America, only more so.<br> Lavishly illustrated and based on the finest scholarship, <em>The Oxford History of the American West</em> is the first comprehensive study to do full justice to the rich complexity of this region. It brings together the work of twenty-eight leading western historians who explore this area from a dazzling number of perspectives. They provide insightful portraits of the West as a distinctive place of varied peoples--native and non-native, European and Asian, African and Latino--and of varied terrain--from the timbered Pacific Northwest to the Dakota Badlands, and from the fires of Kilauea to the ice cliffs of Glacier Bay, Alaska. They describe the great wealth generated by a series of spectacular bonanzas, such as gold at Sutter's Mill, copper in Butte, Montana, and oil on Alaska's north shore; illuminate the role of the West in the national and global economy; and consider the environmental challenges created by replacing buffalo with cattle or by designating national parks and military test sites. The book also examines the social forces behind the violence of the West, the great political movements that affected the region (most notably, the Populist Party), and the importance of families in settling the West (for instance, tracing one family's westward migration over 150 years). The authors provide important insights about many longstanding controversies, and they offer not only the fruits of the latest thinking about the West, but also a vivid sense of how people actually lived. For instance, we read of pioneers who grated green corn to make pudding they flavored with berries and grasshoppers, and who ate the culms (the soft inner linings of the stalks) like asparagus. Finally, each chapter concludes with an extensive annotated bibliography, offering a full review of related material, and there is a comprehensive index to guide readers to topcis of special interest.<br> Ranging from a thoughtful analysis of John Ford's classic <em>My Darling Clementine</em>, to a revisionist look at cattle grandee Granville Stuart (once Montana's most revered pioneer), to a survey of Western art and literature (including figures as diverse as Francis Parkman, Frederic Remington, Willa Cather, Georgia O'Keeffe, and N. Scott Momaday), this lively, authoritative volume continually challenges the familiar as it broadens the reader's understanding of a vast and varied region.</p><p>The storybook version of the American West, brought to us by Hollywood and TV, assumes a conflict of two opposing forces: cowboys against Indians, say, or cattle barons against small farmers. The real history of the West involves the conflict--but also the union--of many forces and peoples. This was true during the Spanish colonization of New Mexico, the Mormon arrival in Utah, and, after World War II, the transformation of California from backwater into cutting-edge region. The cycle persists today, as the West continues to grow in population and political influence. In <i>The Oxford History of the American West</i> 28 professional historians gather to analyze the West's history; the result of their work is an important reference.<br><em>About the Editors:</em><br> <strong>Clyde A.

It is based on The Story of Civilization, the 11-volume masterpiece of world history for the general reader.

He and his wife were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1968 for <i>Rousseau and Revolution</i>, and he was a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Durant spent over forty years writing the critically acclaimed eleven-volume <i>Story of Civilization</i>, the later volumes with the help of his wife, Ariel. He sought to revitalize history by unifying and humanizing the great body of historical knowledge, which had become voluminous and fragmented into esoteric subcategories. He also strove to bring philosophy to the common man. Durant was a champion of human rights, social reform, and the brotherhood of man long before they became well-known issues.<br><br> <b>Ariel Durant</b> (1898-1981) was a Russian-born American researcher and writer and the coauthor of the eleven-volume <i>Story of Civilization</i> with her husband Will Durant. Ariel and Will Durant were jointly awarded the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1968 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977. Ariel was named the 1977 Woman of the Year by the city of Los Angeles.<br><br><b>Chapter 1</b><br><b>Hesitations</b><br>As his studies come to a close the historian faces the challenge: Of what use have your studies been? Have you found in your work only the amusement of recounting the rise and fall of nations and ideas, and retelling "sad stories of the death of kings"? Have you learned more about human nature than the man in the street can learn without so much as opening a book? Have you derived from history any illumination of our present condition, any guidance for our judgments and policies, any guard against the rebuffs of surprise or the vicissitudes of change? Have you found such regularities in the sequence of past events that you can predict the future actions of mankind or the fate of states? Is it possible that, after all, "history has no sense," that it teaches us nothing, and that the immense past was only the weary rehearsal of the mistakes that the future is destined to make on a larger stage and scale?<br>At times we feel so, and a multitude of doubts assail our enterprise. To begin with, do we really know what the past was, what actually happened, or is history "a fable" not quite "agreed upon"? Our knowledge of any past event is always incomplete, probably inaccurate, beclouded by ambivalent evidence and biased historians, and perhaps distorted by our own patriotic or religious partisanship. "Most history is guessing, and the rest is prejudice." Even the historian who thinks to rise above partiality for his country, race, creed, or class betrays his secret predilection in his choice of materials, and in the nuances of his adjectives. "The historian always oversimplifies, and hastily selects a manageable minority of facts and faces out of a crowd of souls and events whose multitudinous complexity he can never quite embrace or comprehend." -- Again, our conclusions from the past to the future are made more hazardous than ever by the acceleration of change. In 1909 Charles Peguy thought that "the world changed less since Jesus Christ than in the last thirty years". and perhaps some young doctor of philosophy in physics would now add that his science has changed more since 1909 than in all recorded time before. Every year -- sometimes, in war, every month -- some new invention, method, or situation compels a fresh adjustment of behavior and ideas. -- Furthermore, an element of chance, perhaps of freedom, seems to enter into the conduct of metals and men. We are no longer confident that atoms, much less organisms, will respond in the future as we think they have responded in the past. The electrons, like Cowper's God, move in mysterious ways their wonders to perform, and some quirk of character or circumstance may upset national equations, as when Alexander drank himself to death and let his new empire fall apart (323 B.C.), or as when Frederick the Great was saved from disaster by the accession of a Czar infatuated with Prussian ways (1762).<br>Obviously historiography cannot be a science. It can only be an industry, an art, and a philosophy -- an industry by ferreting out the facts, an art by establishing a meaningful order in the chaos of materials, a philosophy by seeking perspective and enlightenment. "The present is the past rolled up for action, and the past is the present unrolled for understanding" -- or so we believe and hope. In philosophy we try to see the part in the light of the whole; in the "philosophy of history" we try to see this moment in the light of the past. We know that in both cases this is a counsel of perfection; total perspective is an optical illusion. We do not know the whole of man's history; there were probably many civilizations before the Sumerian or the Egyptian; we have just begun to dig! We must operate with partial knowledge, and be provisionally content with probabilities; in history, as in science and politics, relativity rules, and all formulas should be suspect. "History smiles at all attempts to force its flow into theoretical patterns or logical grooves; it plays havoc with our generalizations, breaks all our rules; history is baroque." Perhaps, within these limits, we can learn enough from history to bear reality patiently, and to respect one another's delusions.<br>Since man is a moment in astronomic time, a transient guest of the earth, a spore of his species, a scion of his race, a composite of body, character, and mind, a member of a family and a community, a believer or doubter of a faith, a unit in an economy, perhaps a citizen in a state or a soldier in an army, we may ask under the corresponding heads -- astronomy, geology, geography, biology, ethnology, psychology, morality, religion, economics, politics, and war -- what history has to say about the nature, conduct, and prospects of man.

It is not, however, a warfare in which guns and bombs are used; it s a spiritual warfare, where life does not end with a physical death, but rather eternal death, or eternal glory. The Weapons of Our Warfare is a powerful and anointed book of prayers. It is composed of prayers that will revolutionize your spiritual life and walk with Christ. It also teaches some of the principle rules and guidelines concerning prayer, along with scriptural references to assist you. It deals with binding the enemy, spoiling his goods, pulling down strongholds, and casting down the wicked works of Satan. Once we have entered into this type of warfare, we can take back the things the devil has stole from us.</p><p>Pastor Kenneth Scott is the author of the best seller, prayer handbook series entitled, The Weapons of Our Warfare. Pastor Scott served 13 years in the military as a medical combat, paramedic where he learned strategic, tactical warfare. It was in learning about the military s strategy and warfare that God used in helping him to understand the spiritual aspects and strategies of our warfare with Satan. Pastor Scott has written 11 books on prayer and spiritual warfare. He is the pastor of Love of God ministries in Birmingham, AL. He serves the body of Christ as teacher, teaching God s people how to live victorious lives in Christ, through teaching them the proper principles, rules and precepts of prayer. He teaches the believer how to obtain victory in their lives, and give them the knowledge, authority and boldness to take back the things that Satan has stolen from them, and maintain their place of victory in Christ. Pastor Scott and his wife Doris have been married for 26 years. They work together in ministry and both have the same heart and passion for prayer, intercession and the desire to see God s people delivered, set free and loosed from the strongholds and clutches of Satan. We invite you to take advantage of the teaching ministry of Pastor and author Kenneth Scott. As you hear him speak under the authority and anointing of the Holy Spirit, your life will never be the same again. So prepare yourself to be blessed as you experience the power of God through the teaching and preaching ministry of Pastor Kenneth Scott.</p><h2>The E-Myth Financial Advisor (E-myth Expert)</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

All the cherished scenes and memorable characters of the wonderful Herriot books come to life as the world&#39;s most beloved veterinarian takes you it his favorite places. . .and in warm, loving, deeply enriching commentary, shares with you memories of his life with Helen, Fiegfried, Tristan and the special animals he has so tenderly cared for in this hauntingly beautiful corner of England.James Herriot (1916-1995) was the bestselling author of memoirs including <i>All Creatures Great and Small</i>, <i>All Things Bright and Beautiful</i>, <i>All Things Wise and Wonderful</i>, <i>The Lord God Made Them All</i>, and <i>Every Living Thing</i>. At age 23, Herriot qualified for veterinary practice with the Glasgow Veterinary College, and moved to the town of Thirsk in Yorkshire to work in a rural practice. He would live in, work in, and write about the region for the rest of his life. Though he dreamed for years of writing a book, his veterinary work and his family kept him busy, and he did not start writing until the age of 50. In 1979, he was awarded the title Order of the British Empire (OBE). His veterinary practice in Yorkshire, England, is now tended by his son, Jim Wight.</p><h2>Naked</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p>Hip radio comedy fans and theater folks who belong to the cult of Obie-winning playwright/performer David Sedaris must kill to get this book. These would be fans of the scaldingly snide Sedaris's hilariously described personal misadventures like <i>The Santaland Diaries</i> (a monologue about his work as an elf to a department store Santa) seen off-Broadway in 1997. In a series of similarly textured essays, Sedaris takes us along on his catastrophic detours through a nudist colony, a fruit-packing plant, his own childhood, and a dozen more of the world's little purgatories.David Sedaris is a playwright, radio commentator, contributor to Esquire and apartment cleaner.</p><h2>Buddhism with an Attitude: The Tibetan Seven-Point Mind Training</h2><p>All of us have attitudes. Some of them accord with reality and serve us well throughout the course of our lives. Others are out of alignment with reality and cause us problems. Tibetan Buddhist practice isn't just sitting in silent meditation, it's developing fresh attitudes that align our minds with reality. Attitudes need adjusting, just like a spinal column that has been knocked out of alignment. In this book, B. Alan Wallace explains a fundamental type of Buddhist mental training which is designed to shift our attitudes so that our minds become pure wellsprings of joy instead of murky pools of problems, anxieties, fleeting pleasures, hopes, and frustrations. Wallace shows us the way to develop attitudes that unveil our full capacity for spiritual awakening. <br><br>The author draws on his thirty-year training in Buddhism, physics, the cognitive sciences, and comparative religion to challenge readers to reappraise many of their assumptions about the nature of the mind and physical world. By explicitly addressing many practical and theoretical issues that uniquely face us in the modern world, Wallace brings this centuries-old practice into the twenty-first century.</p><p>Yes, the title can be misleading. This isn't a book about hip Buddhism with some kind of bad-ass attitude. This is a training manual for learning Buddhist attitudes that will help readers find greater peace of mind and happiness in daily life. The premise here is mind control the Tibetan Buddhist way. Wallace (<i>Boundless Heart</i>) draws upon the traditional "root text" of the Seven-Point Mind Training and expertly translates the ancient teachings into a Western-flavored lesson. In fact, another possible title for this highly esteemed book might be, Buddhism Taught with a Western Attitude. Rather than rely solely on the traditional teaching methods of using stories and parables to ground Buddhist theory into daily living, Wallace sprinkles in large doses of intellectual and scientific analogies&#x2014;definite crowd-pleasers in the West. For instance, when he delves into two Buddhist approaches for training the mind's attention&#x2014;control and release&#x2014;he uses the ancient metaphor of taming an elephant in the room to heel. But in the next breath he moves into a modern analogy of purifying a polluted river. This slip-sliding ease between the language and sensibilities of ancient and modern worlds is a marvel and delight for any Western student of Buddhism. <p></p> A few caveats: Wallace is not as cozy of a writer as other popular Buddhist teachers of the West, such as Pema Chodron, Jack Kornfield, or Sharon Salzburg. His is more of the Ken Wilbur and Robert Thurman variety&#x2014;fascinated by the keen intelligence behind this ancient religion as well as its big heart and timeless relevance. Think of this as a mind-blowing, attitude-expanding book, rather than a comfy bedside companion. <i>Gail Hudson</i>B. Alan Wallace has authored, translated, edited, and contributed to more than forty books on Tibetan Buddhism, science, and culture. With fourteen years as a Buddhist monk, he earned a BA in physics and the philosophy of science and then a PhD in religious studies. After teaching in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, he founded the Santa Barbara Institute for Consciousness Studies to explore the integration of scientific approaches and contemplative methods.</p><h2>Eric Sloane&#39;s America</h2><p>An insightful guide to the vanishing landscape of days gone by features more than two hundred illustrations of barns, covered bridges, road signs, country inns, and steepled churches.</p><p></p><h2>Tapestry Weaving (Search Press Classics)</h2><p>This colourful, exciting book offers a rich source of stimulating and innovative ideas that will appeal to all abilities.</p><p>Kirsten Glasbrook trained as a weaver in Denmark where she was born. After moving to London in the 1960&#39;s she spent time restoring antique tapestries. She taught part time at the Bath Academy of Art for many years, and now lives and works in Devon, running workshops and classes for adults and children. Her commissions have included work for the Forestry Commission and numerous private collectors in the UK and other countries. Using mainly wool, linen and cotton, she designs and weaves tapestries, often with a mythological, mystical or meditative theme. The weaving techniques are simple and traditional and the brilliant color ranges, and diversity of texture in the different yarns, are a constant challenge and excitement.When modern crafters think of tapestry weaving, they often think of the large-scale medieval tapestries that hang in museums or historical landmarks, but the history of tapestry stretches back much further, to ancient Egypt and other world cultures. In her introduction to tapestry weaving, Glasbrook provides an overview of basic loom setup, weaving techniques, and tapestry design in the form of a sampler project featuring abstract designs. Unlike other forms of weaving, tapestry weaving does not require an expensive loom-one can be made from a simple frame or even stiff cardboard. Glasbrook covers loom preparation, including winding the warp and warping the loom, selection of warp and weft yarn, and techniques for weaving a variety of patterns via a small sampler project. A gallery of Glasbrook&#39;s work, along with tips and techniques for weaving similar projects, follows. VERDICT Tapestry isn&#39;t generally covered in beginner weaving books, and there&#39;s plenty of information here to get novices started with this fascinating and ancient craft. * Library Journal USA * Tapestry Weaving by Kirsten Glasbrook provides a logical and systematic approach to the craft. The book explains the weaving of woolen cloths, linen and cotton on simple rectangular frames with notches, or specially built looms for bigger work. The book explains many techniques, which are accompanied by step by step photographs such as such as deformation of weft lines, vertical appertures, diagonal shapes and curves. The book is suitable for beginners, but will also inspire experienced weavers too. * Textiel Plus *</p><h2>Quayside Publishing Book, Assorted</h2><p><p></p><i>The Art of Watercolor Painting</i> offers a fresh take on a beloved classic art medium.

Employing one out of twelve people in the world and producing $6.5 trillion of the world&#x2019;s economy, it is the main source of income for many countries. </b><b>Elizabeth Becker describes the dimensions of this industry and its huge effect on the world economy, the environment, and our culture. </b><br><br>Tourism, fast becoming the largest global business, employs one out of twelve persons and produces $6.5 trillion of the world&#x2019;s economy. In a groundbreaking book, Elizabeth Becker uncovers how what was once a hobby has become a colossal enterprise with profound impact on countries, the environment, and cultural heritage. <br><br>This invisible industry exploded at the end of the Cold War. In 2012 the number of tourists traveling the world reached one billion. Now everything can be packaged as a tour: with the high cost of medical care in the U.S., Americans are booking a vacation and an operation in countries like Turkey for a fraction of the cost at home. <br><br>Becker travels the world to take the measure of the business: France invented the travel business and is still its leader; Venice is expiring of over-tourism. In Cambodia, tourists crawl over the temples of Angkor, jeopardizing precious cultural sites. Costa Rica rejected raising cattle for American fast-food restaurants to protect their wilderness for the more lucrative field of eco-tourism. <br><br>Dubai has transformed a patch of desert in the Arabian Gulf into a mammoth shopping mall. Africa&#x2019;s safaris are thriving, even as its wildlife is threatened by foreign poachers. Large cruise ships are spoiling the oceans and ruining city ports as their American-based companies reap handsome profits through tax loopholes. China, the giant, is at last inviting tourists and sending its own out in droves. The United States, which invented some of the best of tourism, has lost its edge due to political battles. Becker reveals travel as product. Seeing the tourism industry from the inside out, through her eyes and ears, we experience a dizzying range of travel options though very few quiet getaways. Her investigation is a first examination of one of the largest and potentially most destructive enterprises in the world.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, April 2013</strong>: Tourism is on track to become the world's biggest business. In <em>Overbooked</em>, Elizabeth Becker, senior foreign editor at NPR and a former <em>New York Times</em> correspondent, uses tourism as a lens through which to explore the current geopolitical landscape. As much as <em>Overbooked</em> travels across countries, it also travels through time: Becker looks at tourism's past (popularized by the French in the '50s!), where it is today (the prevalence of resort and cultural travel), and its future (China's rise as both a destination and a source of tourists). As much economic development as tourism brings, Becker consistently sees a dark side to the industry's rapid growth. She writes, "Tourism is one of those double-edged swords that may look like an easy way to earn desperately needed money but can ravage wilderness areas and undermine native cultures to fit into package tours." <em>--Kevin Nguyen</em>Elizabeth Becker is an award-winning author and former correspondent for <i>The New York Times</i> who reported from Europe, Asia, and South America.

The novels bring Arthur and his world to vivid life. A man battling for his vision of the future in a brutal age, dragged down by suspicions and magics of the past, surrounded by intrigue, dependent on his skill at war and genius for leadership.</p><p>Cornwell furnishes a provocative look at the Arthurian legends in <i>Enemy of God</i>, the second book in the Warlords Chronicle. This version of the tale takes place during the Dark Ages, when even the lords of the land lived in thatched huts. Arthur, still defending Britain for his younger half-brother Mordred, faces religious uprisings, Saxon invasions, and disloyalty at the heart of the kingdom. His uncompromising belief in oaths and his optimistic blindness to human betrayal isolate him from even his closest friends. At the same time, Merlin's quest for the Cauldron (read Holy Grail) also becomes entangled in treachery. <p> Cornwell's writing skills have continued to evolve since his journeyman Sharpe series, and <i>Enemy of God</i> combines intriguing descriptions of Druidical magic with the war-ravaged landscape of Dark Ages Britain, without holding back on the brutality of vengeance and war. The Matter of Britain always commands interest, and Cornwell invests the usual splendor and tragedy with the human squalor of the times. <i>--Blaise Selby</i></p>Bernard Cornwell is the author of many historical thrillers, including the SHARPE series which was a highly successful television drama. He was born in London but now lives in America.</p><h2>Roads : Driving America&#39;s Great Highways</h2><p>McMurtry shares his fascination with trails and the culture that has grown up on either side of them as he reminisces about a cross-country trip, recounting the places he&#39;s seen, the people he has met and the books he has read. 100,000 first printing.</p><p>You couldn't find a blunter or more accurate title for Larry McMurtry's third work of nonfiction. <i>Roads</i> is indeed an automotive odyssey, in which the author traverses America on one highway after another. As such, the book has a long and honorable pedigree, stretching back to Tocqueville by way of Kerouac, and many readers will compare it to William Least Heat-Moon's bucolic ramble, <i>Blue Highways</i>. That, however, would be a mistake. The last thing McMurtry has in mind is a leisurely tour of small-town America--he's interested in the interstates themselves, "the great roads, the major migration routes that carry Americans long distances quickly." No wonder the speedometer seldom dips below 65 mph throughout the entire narrative. McMurtry is a man on the move, and even his meditative moments fly by in the linguistic equivalent of fourth gear. <p> Actually, there may be another reason the author is reluctant to apply the brakes: his distaste for various towns, villages, counties, and entire states. Planning a trip to the Texas hill country? McMurtry notes that "the soil is too stoney to farm or ranch, the hills are just sort of forested speed bumps, and the people, mostly of stern Teutonic stock, are suspicious, tightfisted, unfriendly, and mean." Missouri is "a place to get through as rapidly as possible," Ohio and Georgia "really aren't pleasant," and woe to the traveler who lingers in the one-horse towns of the West, "where it's not even wise to roll down one's windows--if you avoid getting murdered you might still breathe in some deadly desert germ."</p><p> This crankiness does have an undeniable comic appeal. Yet <i>Roads</i> turns out to be a sentimental journey after all, in the course of which McMurtry hopes to resurrect some of the <i>�lan vital</i> he lost in the wake of his 1991 heart surgery. Driving, like reading itself, just may prompt some remembrance of things past: </p><blockquote> As I prepared to drive those same overfamiliar roads again it occurred to me that my effort was obliquely Proustian, a retracing of my past that is analogous to the many rereadings I've done in the last few years, always of books I read before the surgery. In these rereadings and redrivings I'm searching, not for lost time, but for lost feelings, for the elements of my old personality that are still unaccounted for. I'm not anguished about these absentees, just curious and somewhat wistful. </blockquote> Indeed, anguish is largely absent from McMurtry's account, and he doesn't dwell often on this scenario of loss and recovery. Still, it comes through particularly strongly at the end, when he compares his own, transient experience of place to his father's. These final chapters cast a sadder and more substantial light on the preceding ones--and make this circuitous, sometimes tetchy book a trip worth taking. <i>--James Marcus</i><b>Larry McMurtry,</b> winner of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, is the author, most recently, of <i>Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen,</i> as well as twenty-two novels, two collections of essays, a memoir, and more than thirty screenplays.

It wasn't a "good" life, in either sense of the word, but it was an adventurous one; and the tale he has to tell presents an honest and oddly attractive picture of an insider in that separate, unofficial world.<br><br>In his low, hoarse voice, he describes the random events that led the son of a prosperous country shopkeeper to become a member, and ultimately the leader, of a gang organizing illegal dice games in Tokyo's liveliest entertainment area. He talks about his first police raid, and the brutal interrogation and imprisonment that followed it. He remembers his first love affair, and the girl he ran away with, and the weeks they spent wandering about the countryside together. Briefly, and matter-of-factly, he describes how he cut off the little finger of his left hand as a ritual gesture of apology. He explains how the games were run and the profits spent; why the ties between members of "the brotherhood" were so important; and how he came to kill a man who worked for him.<br><br>What emerges is a contradictory personality: tough but not unsentimental; stubborn yet willing to take life more or less as it comes; impulsive but careful to observe the rules of the business he had joined.<br><br>And in the end, when his tale is finished, you feel you would probably have liked him if you'd met him in person. Fortunately, Dr. Saga's record of his long conversations with him provides a wonderful substitute for that meeting.</p><p><br>Dr. JUNICHI SAGA is a medical doctor with a general practice in Tsuchiura, Ibaraki Prefecture, on Lake Kasumigaura. He began taping his elderly patients' reminiscences about thirty years ago when he realized what a wealth of detail and information they contained. He has published numerous works of local history and ecology, two of which are available in English: <em>Memories of Wind and Waves</em> and <em>Memories of Silk and Straw</em>. In his spare time he does ink painting.<br><br>JOHN BESTER, the translator, is one of the foremost translators of Japanese fiction. In 1990 he was given the first Noma Award for the Translation of Japanese Literature, for his English version of a short-story collection by Yukio Mishima entitled <em>Acts of Worship</em>.<br>From "Eloping" in Part II <p>I went with her as far as Koiwa, then went on alone to Funabashi, found an eating place where they knew me, and asked them to lend me a kitchen knife. </p><p>"Haven't seen you for ages, Eiji," said a cook with a cotton towel bound neatly around his forehead. "What do you want it for?" </p><p>"I'm going to use it here, so don't worry. I'll give it back to you right away." </p><p>He gave me the knife. I held one end of a bit of string I'd brought with me between my teeth, got hold of the other end with my right hand, and tied it around the little finger of my left hand. I pulled it as tight as I could. Then I chopped off the tip of the finger. The cook just stood there gawping, but it hurt too much for me to bother about him. I cut off one end of the clean white cotton of my bellyband, bound up the finger, then asked him for a sheet of paper. I wrapped the bit of finger in it, and left. I wasn't at all sure that cutting off a finger would be enough to make them let me off, but there wasn't any other way by now. So I set out for Makuta's place in a sort of what-the-hell mood. </p><p>When I called out in the entrance, a maid came out, and a young man with her. I introduced myself and said I'd come to apologize, and held out the finger, still wrapped in its piece of paper. </p><p>"Just wait there a second, will you?" the man said, and disappeared inside the house. I didn't know whether Makuta was in or not, but I could hear women talking at the back of the house. My hand by now was throbbing like hell, and my kimono was soaked with clammy sweat. </p><p>After a while the same man came out again and said, more politely than I'd expected, "The boss says he understands. Now will you please leave?" </p><p>"I see," I said. "I'm much obliged." And I bowed and left. </p><p>It all went off so simply that I felt kind of let down. After that, I went straight back to Asakusa. On the way, I kept wondering why he'd made so little fuss, but I couldn't make any sense of it. So I assumed my boss must have done the apologizing for me. The boss was back in town by then. He glanced at me when I showed up, and said, "Mind you take yourself a bit more seriously from now on." And that was all he ever said about it.</p></p><h2>Light Up Your Watercolors Layer by Layer</h2><p><p><b>Give your paintings more life - with light!</b></p><p>The best watercolor paintings have a certain radiance, a richness of light, color and detail.</p><p>You can bring these same effects to your own work with the help of award-winning painter <b>Linda Stevens Moyer</b>.

All rights reserved</i></p><h2>High Noon: The Hollywood Blacklist and the Making of an American Classic</h2><p><p><b>From the <i>New York Times-</i>bestselling author of <i>The Searchers</i>, the revelatory story behind the classic movie <i>High Noon </i>and the toxic political climate in which it was created. </b></p><p>It's one of the most revered movies of Hollywood's golden era. Starring screen legend Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly in her first significant film role, <i>High Noon</i> was shot on a lean budget over just thirty-two days but achieved instant box-office and critical success. It won four Academy Awards in 1953, including a best actor win for Cooper. And it became a cultural touchstone, often cited by politicians as a favorite film, celebrating moral fortitude.</p><p>Yet what has been often overlooked is that <i>High Noon</i> was made during the height of the Hollywood blacklist, a time of political inquisition and personal betrayal. In the middle of the film shoot, screenwriter Carl Foreman was forced to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities about his former membership in the Communist Party. Refusing to name names, he was eventually blacklisted and fled the United States. (His co-authored screenplay for another classic, <i>The Bridge on the River Kwai</i>, went uncredited in 1957.) Examined in light of Foreman's testimony, <i>High Noon</i>'s emphasis on courage and loyalty takes on deeper meaning and importance.</p><p>In this book, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Glenn Frankel tells the story of the making of a great American Western, exploring how Carl Foreman's concept of <i>High Noon </i>evolved from idea to first draft to final script, taking on allegorical weight. Both the classic film and its turbulent political times emerge newly illuminated.</p></p><p><b>Glenn Frankel </b>worked for many years for the <i>Washington Post</i>, winning a Pulitzer Prize in 1989, and taught journalism at Stanford University and the University of Texas at Austin, where he directed the School of Journalism. He has won the National Jewish Book Award and<i> </i>was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. His most recent book, <i>The Searchers</i>, was a national bestseller and named one of <i>Library Journal</i>'s top ten books of 2013. He lives in Arlington, Virginia. www.glennfrankel.com.<p>"Glenn Frankel comes to his subject with a widely praised book about John Ford's 'The Searchers' and an impressive resume in journalism, including a Pulitzer Prize. Although much of Frankel&#x2019;s material is familiar, the blacklist is a gift that keeps on giving. . . Frankel narrates this story well. He has a sure ear for the telling anecdote, and a good eye for detail. "- <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"Though Frankel began this sumptuous history long before the latest election, he ends up reminding us that 2016 was far from the first time that politicians trafficked in lies and fear, and showing us how, nonetheless, people of integrity came together to do exemplary work." - <i>Washington Post</i></p><p>"The movie 'High Noon,' great in itself, is all the greater for the backstory Mr. Frankel tells." - <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>"Mixing elements of biography, social history and film analysis, author Glenn Frankel uncovers drama and tragedy not usually found in discussions of moviemaking. His detailed narrative is a primer for those who don't understand how the blacklist era endangered free speech and other constitutional values. "- <i>Associated Press</i></p><p>"Frankel reviews the now familiar history of the blacklist with grace and accuracy; his descriptions of witness testimony are particularly vivid. . . . Fascinating." - <i>The Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>"Frankel paints a devastating picture of a powerful force crumbling under oppression--a cautionary tale in borrowed cowboy hats. . . . <i>High Noon</i> is a sharp social history that reminds us just how common for a broken system to abuse its power and cause deep human damage--the worst is coming, any second--but also that a little cynicism can be useful. Kane defends a worthless city; Kane wins. There are no clean endings, except in the movies." - <i>NPR.org</i></p><p>"[A] compelling new book. . . . The real strength of Frankel's account lies in its illustration, in many shades of gray, of the Hollywood blacklist and what it did, in practical terms, as it ruined or derailed many, many careers. . . . The Red Scare Hollywood era is familiar nonfiction territory, but Frankel makes it vital and gets down to the roots.&#x201d; - <i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><p>"Film historian Glenn Frankel profiles the times, the movie and its message in his fascinating and revealing new book <i>High Noon: The Hollywood Blacklist and the Making of an American Classic </i>. . . Frankel--who previously uncovered the backstory of the classic John Wayne movie 'The Searchers'--says the blacklist marked a uniquely grim time in American history, one with special resonance today." - <i>Christian Science Monitor</i></p><p>"The blacklist has provided grist for many books, including Victor Navasky's seminal study <i>Naming Names</i>. But Frankel's book feels fresh nonetheless. . . . He brings out the drama and the no-win situation of everyone who was called before HUAC: throw your friends and colleagues under the bus by naming them as former or current Communists or sympathizers, or watch your life and career go up in flames." - <i>Dallas Morning News</i></p><p>"Film buffs and history aficionados will be delighted and riveted by Glenn Frankel's insightful and intimate look at the making of the classic 1952 western <i>High Noon</i>. . . Frankel's saga presents a gripping and coherent picture of the corrupt politics, paranoia and fear mongering that drove Hollywood studio heads to capitulate to anti-Communist witch-hunters." - <i>Shelf Awareness</i></p><p>"Not far removed from a James Ellroy novel. The 1950s film industry portrayed in <i>High Noon </i>is, like Ellroy's Los Angeles, stocked with hard-core commies, idealistic fellow travelers, paranoid Red-baiters, union busters, corrupt congressmen, power-hungry gossip columnists, secretive FBI agents and their snitches, philandering actors and eager starlets. But far from being a <i>Hollywood Babylon </i>of the Red Scare, Frankel's book is a detailed investigation of the way anti-communist persecution poisoned the atmosphere around one film, which succeeded nonetheless, and damaged the lives of the people who made it." - <i>Bookforum</i></p><p>"Besides the macro picture of Hollywood in its darkest era, Frankel is excellent at capturing the micro aspects as well, fascinatingly weaving in multiple and competing accounts of how the film was pieced together in the editing room. . . A comprehensive guide to both a classic film and the era that created it." - <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>"An absorbing account of how a routine 1952 western starring a has-been and an unknown became an unexpected classic. . . this story of politics, art, loyalty and conscience is more relevant than ever. And a nice bonus: Although it may impart a civics lesson, it doesn't read like one. "- <i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i></p><p>"Frankel draws on a plethora of sources to craft a tale that, as a thriller, rivals "High Noon" itself." - <i>The Houston Chronicle</i></p><p>"This may be one of the most accessible books ever written concerning the effects of HUAC on Hollywood, as Frankel's decision to blend these two aspects of Hollywood history, and his innate skill as a journalist, has produced a highly readable and fascinating look at a period that is less widely known than one might imagine. VERDICT: Anyone interested in film and/or politics will enjoy and learn from this book." - <i>Library Journal</i></p><p>"So much has been written about the blacklist's perpetrators and victims that you might be forgiven for thinking you know all there is worth knowing, but Frankel offers new details and fresh insights. His portrait of Gary Cooper's life and career is equally incisive . . . It will almost surely stand as the definitive document about this landmark movie. I can't wait to see what subject this skilled journalist will tackle next." - Leonard Maltin</p><p>"Glenn Frankel has endowed the term &#x2018;film historian&#x2019; with a sweeping new dimension. <i>High Noon</i> is full of scholarly insight, compelling history and wonderfully dishy moments, but like his previous book on <i>The Searchers</i> it is also an American chronicle of real consequence. When Frankel writes about the making of a movie he is writing about the making of a country." - Stephen Harrigan, author of THE GATES OF THE ALAMO and A FRIEND OF MR. LINCOLN</p><p>"Glenn Frankel's <i>High Noon</i> isn't just everything you always wanted to know about an enduring classic; it's a deeply insightful portrait of the forces in postwar America and in blacklist-era Hollywood that made the film such a powerful product of such a troubled moment." - Mark Harris, author of PICTURES AT A REVOLUTION and FIVE CAME BACK</p><p>"Glenn Frankel's <i>High Noon</i> is three splendid books in one: a moment by moment account of the making of the classic western, a history of the Hollywood blacklist with much new material based on primary research, and, in the rise of Stanley Kramer Productions, the story of the independent producers who gradually supplanted conventional studio production. Even if we know how each story ends, it's never less than a continuously fascinating read." - Scott Eyman, author of JOHN WAYNE: THE LIFE AND LEGEND</p></p><h2>Jane Austen: The World of Her Novels</h2><p>With a wealth of details about Jane Austen&#39;s life and times, this volume brings to life the world of her novels.

Opus has always listened quietly while Grandma reads him his favourite bedtime story. But this time Opus decides to finish the story his way.</p><p>Berkeley Breathed is a cartoonist, novelist, director, and screenwriter, best known for the popular comic strip Bloom County. He has written and/or illustrated many books for young readers, including Red Ranger Came Calling, The Last Basselope, Goodnight Opus, and A Wish for Wings That Worked.<br>Grade 1 Up-This imaginative bedtime story pokes gentle fun at a childhood classic and encourages children to "depart the text" occasionally and search for new adventures. Opus the penguin is snuggled up in bed, wearing his bunny jammies and listening to the 210th reading of his favorite bedtime story when his sweet old grannie starts to snooze. With a friend or two in tow (one cleverly constructed from a pillow and a smiling balloon), Opus decides to head for the Milky Way. After several brief stops (one to take a dip in the reflecting pool with Abe Lincoln; another to commiserate with an overworked tooth fairy), the penguin and his pals arrive at their destination, where they feast on ice cream with a crowd of cheerful cows. Back home, Granny wakes up to discover Opus asleep on the kitchen floor with a pint of ice cream clutched in his hand. The comical illustrations allude to Margaret Wise Brown's Goodnight Moon, as does the bouncy, rhyming text. The art is similar to that in Breathed's cartoons, but has a broader, more Disney-film feel. Animals and people are not realistically portrayed, but are rounded, exaggerated caricatures. While there are occasional glimpses of Breathed's typical barbed wit, the general tone of the story is less sarcastic than that of his cartoon collections. This gentler tone, along with the popularity of the title he parodies, makes the book accessible to a wide age range. While the most likely audience consists of "Bloom County" and/or "Outland" fans, even libraries without his previous titles may want to consider this one.<br><i>Lisa Dennis, The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>History &amp; Class Consciousness</h2><p>Lukac&#39;s long suppressed, but most famous work of Marxist theory. &#34;It is one of the indispensable works of the twentieth century&#34; - Raymond Williams.

Gwynne tells the incredible story of how two unknown coaches revolutionized American football at every level, from high school to the NFL.<br><br>Hal Mumme is one of a handful of authentic offensive geniuses in the history of American football. <i>The Perfect Pass </i>is the story of how he irreverently destroyed and re-created the game.<br> <br>Mumme spent fourteen mostly losing seasons coaching football before inventing a potent passing offense that would soon shock players, delight fans, and terrify opposing coaches. The revolution he fomented began at a tiny, overlooked college called Iowa Wesleyan, where Mumme was head coach and Mike Leach, a lawyer who had never played college football, was hired as his offensive line coach. In the cornfields of Iowa, while scribbling plays on paper napkins, these two mad inventors, drawn together by a shared disregard for conventionalism and a love for Jimmy Buffett, began to engineer the purest, most extreme passing game in the 145-year history of football. Implementing their &#x201c;Air Raid&#x201d; offense, their teams&#x2014;at Iowa Wesleyan and later at Valdosta State and the University of Kentucky&#x2014;played blazingly fast&#x2014;faster than any team ever had before, and they routinely beat teams with far more talented athletes. And Mumme and Leach did it all without even a playbook. Their quarterback once completed sixty-one of eighty-six passes, both collegiate records.<br> <br>In <i>The Perfect Pass</i>, S.C. Gwynne explores Mumme&#x2019;s leading role in changing football from a run-dominated sport to a pass-dominated one, the game that tens of millions of Americans now watch every fall weekend. Whether you&#x2019;re a casual or ravenous football fan, this is a truly compelling story of American ingenuity and how a set of revolutionary ideas made their way from the margins into the hot center of the game we celebrate today.</p><p>S.C. Gwynne&nbsp;is the author of <i>Hymns of the Republic</i> and the <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers <i>Rebel Yell</i> and <i>Empire of the Summer Moon</i>, which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award. He spent most of his career as a journalist, including stints with <i>Time </i>as bureau chief, national correspondent, and senior editor, and with <i>Texas Monthly </i>as executive editor.

That makes his subtitle all the more fitting, for undeniably, the two coaches changed the game&#x2014;and brought glory to their institutions.

Dalin&#39;s controversial new book, he explodes the newly resurrected, widely accepted, yet utterly bankrupt smearing of Pope Pius XII, whom Jewish survivors of the Holocaust considered a righteous gentile.</p><p>Was Pope Pius XII secretly in league with Adolf Hitler? No, says Rabbi David G. Dalin&#x2014;but there was a cleric in league with Hitler: the grand mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin al-Husseini. As Pope Pius XII worked to save Jews from the Nazis, the grand mufti became Hitler&#x2019;s staunch ally and a promoter of the Holocaust, with a legacy that feeds radical Islam today. In this shocking and thoroughly documented book, Rabbi Dalin explodes the myth of Hitler&#x2019;s pope and condemns the myth-makers for not only rewriting history, but for denying the testimony of Holocaust survivors, hijacking the Holocaust for unseemly political ends, and ignoring the real threat to the Jewish people. In The Myth of Hitler&#x2019;s Pope, you&#x2019;ll learn: � The true history of Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust&#x2014;how the Catholic Church did more than any other religious body to save Jewish lives � The real history of the Church and the Nazis&#x2014;including the Nazi plan to kidnap the pope � The real agenda of the myth-makers: hijacking the Holocaust to attack the very idea of the papacy&#x2014;especially the papacy of the late Pope John Paul II&#x2014;as well as Christianity and traditional religion as a whole � Hitler&#x2019;s cleric&#x2014;Hajj Amin al-Husseini, who advised and assisted the Nazis in carrying out Hitler&#x2019;s Final Solution � How Pope Pius XII rescued Jews&#x2014;and deserves to be called a "righteous gentile"&#x2014;while the grand mufti of Jerusalem called for their extermination Full of shocking and irrefutable detail, The Myth of Hitler&#x2019;s Pope is sure to generate controversy, and more important, to set the record straight. If you want the truth about Pope Pius XII, about the Catholic Church, the Jews, and the Holocaust, and about how the myth of Hitler&#x2019;s pope plays into the culture wars of our own time&#x2014;and how the fact of Hitler&#x2019;s mufti is a vital source of radical Islam today&#x2014;you must begin here.David G.

The two volumes of <i>Reporting Vietnam</i> offer a trove of material for such studies. Part One contains combat-front writing by journalists who are well known to students of Vietnam War history--Stanley Karnow, David Halberstam, Frances FitzGerald, Bernard Fall, Neil Sheehan, Ward Just, and Zalin Grant among them. The hefty volume--which runs the gamut of journalistic genres, including hard news, analysis, profiles, think pieces, and interviews--covers the home front as well, from which the likes of Norman Mailer and Tom Wolfe have their say.<p> The collection opens with a fairly dispassionate account from <i>Time</i> magazine reporting the deaths of the first U.S. military advisors in 1959; it ends with the complete text of Daniel Lang's long <i>New Yorker</i> piece, "Casualties of War," the basis for Brian De Palma's controversial movie of the same name. In between are accounts of battles on the streets of Chicago and the Central Highlands, studies of the rise of black-power militancy on the ever-changing front lines, and perceptive portraits of ordinary soldiers on both sides of the war. Among the book's many highlights is Neil Sheehan's memoir of his change from hawk to dove as the war progressed. "I have sometimes thought," he writes, "when a street urchin with sores covering his legs stopped me and begged for a few cents' worth of Vietnamese piastres, that he might be better off growing up as a political commissar. He would then, at least, have some self-respect." Such changing views, we can now clearly see, helped shift public opinion in the United States against the war. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>The editorial advisory board for&nbsp;<i>Reporting Vietnam</i>&nbsp;includes&nbsp;<b>Milton J.

His essays and articles have appeared in <i>National Geographic</i>, <i>National Geographic Adventure</i>, and <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, among other publications. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<b>Prologue</b> <p> At dawn, frost silvered the yellow cottonwood leaves strewn in the dirt in front of the visitor center. The men had built a bonfire to warm their morning's play. A fusillade of sharp reports -- stone knocking upon stone -- rang echoless in the cold, clear air. I sat just outside the circle of men, witnessing a cultural paradox whose roots stretched more than five centuries into the past. </p><p> It was October 1994. Near the end of three years of research for a book about those prehistoric geniuses of the Southwest, the Anasazi, I had come to Jemez Pueblo in northern New Mexico. Nine of the ten men laboring before my eyes were from Jemez and its neighbor pueblo, Zia, ten miles to the south. As Puebloans, they were direct descendants of the Anasazi who had built such wondrous villages as Cliff Palace at Mesa Verde, Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon. The tenth man was an Anglo archaeologist named Bruce Bradley, who lives in Cortez, Colorado. The paradox lay in the fact that, at the moment, Bradley was teaching his prot�g�s how to make arrowheads. </p><p> At the time of Coronado's landmark <i>entrada</i> into the Southwest, in A.D. 1540, every Zia and Jemez man knew how to flake and chip formless lumps of chert and obsidian into sleek points that -- hafted to straight sticks that were fletched with bird feathers, sent winging from a well-flexed bow -- could bring down a deer in the forest or an enemy on the trail. Gradually, however, during the decades after the Spanish conquest of New Mexico in 1598, under Don Juan de O�ate, the Puebloans lost the art of arrowhead making. There was no reason to keep that craft alive, once the men had learned how to use harquebuses (the small-caliber muskets of the day) and, later, rifles. </p><p> Through twenty years of trial and error, Bradley had taught himself to flint-knap so well that he could turn a core of creamy chert into any kind of projectile point he wished, from the long, fluted Clovis point favored by Paleo-Indians 9,000 years ago to the tiny triangular arrowheads Puebloans reserved, in the years just before the Spanish came, for killing rabbits. On that chilly October morning, the Zia and Jemez men had assembled under Bradley's tutelage not out of some atavistic yearning for a golden age before the Europeans had come and changed everything, but simply because they had formed an archery club. </p><p> Beside me sat another Anglo, Bill Whatley, who was serving as official archaeologist for Jemez Pueblo. It was Whatley who had arranged my visit. Evidently the paradox before our eyes had set him musing, just as it had me, for now, out of the blue, he leaned close and whispered in my ear, "Do you know that these guys still have Spanish documents they seized during the Pueblo Revolt, which no Anglos have ever seen?" </p><p> Electrified in that moment by Whatley's revelation, I have been haunted by it through the ten years since that October morning in front of the visitor center. In 1994, despite all the research I had done for my Anasazi book, I possessed only a vague understanding of the Pueblo Revolt. In 1680, I knew, the various pueblos scattered along the Rio Grande and to the west had united, for the first and only time in their history, to make a lightning strike that drove all the Spaniards out of New Mexico. Inevitably, I knew, the Spaniards had returned and accomplished the reconquest, but not before the pueblos had enjoyed twelve years of freedom. Yet about how the Revolt had been organized and pulled off, about the eighty-two years of tribulation under the Spanish yoke that had preceded it, about how after 1680 Puebloan unity had fallen apart and allowed the reconquest, and above all about what had happened in New Mexico during those twelve years without the Spanish, I knew next to nothing. </p><p> Two years ago, I scratched the old itch and returned to the Pueblo Revolt, as I began work on this present book. The mild sense of guilt I felt about my ignorance was shared, as I soon learned, by many a Southwest savant. Archaeologists and anthropologists who had toiled in New Mexico for two or three decades confessed to me a kindred ignorance of the details of the great uprising of 1680. A handful of books purported to cover the Revolt, but to my mind they did so in an unsatisfying fashion, leaving the central questions unanswered. All kinds of myths had attached themselves to that stunning interlude in New Mexico history, but it seemed impossible to test the truths that lay at their core. Most surprisingly of all, I began to suspect that even among today's Puebloans, the living memory of the Revolt was dim. </p><p> This struck me as a strange state of affairs. As one historian justly observes, the Pueblo Revolt remains "the point of highest drama in New Mexico's long history." From the Indian point of view, the Revolt, in its complete eradication of the European oppressor from the people's homeland for more than a decade, far outmatches in terms of lasting impact the famous massacre of Custer's army by the Sioux and Cheyenne at Little Big Horn in 1876. In its tragic dimension, the Revolt and reconquest took a toll among the Puebloans every bit as dolorous as the better-known campaigns of the Cherokee Trail of Tears or the Navajo Long Walk to Bosque Redondo. </p><p> As I immersed myself in research on the Pueblo Revolt, I discovered that the Spanish record of that conflagration was voluminous and vivid. Yet the documents preserved in archives in Seville and Mexico City represent but a portion of the testimony recorded at the time by friars and governors, for great piles of those documents were burned by the Puebloans during the Revolt. And who knows how many pueblos today still hoard, in secret repositories, long-lost chronicles seized from the oppressor in 1680? What would a scholar not give to be able to peruse the documents Bill Whatley told me about that October morning at Jemez! </p><p> Watching the men strike flakes of chert free from their cores, I mused further -- about just what value those hoarded documents must possess for the Jemez. As I would come to see, in struggling to fathom photocopies of records from the archives in Mexico City, the orthography of handwritten Spanish in the seventeenth century is so arcane that only experts in a field called paleography ("old writing") can read it. It seemed doubtful that anyone at Jemez could decipher the records seized in 1680 and guarded so zealously ever since. In Ladakh, I had seen Buddhist monks reverently curating ancient scrolls that they had no idea how to read. But that veneration could be explained by faith: the scrolls had the power of holy relics. Perhaps for the Jemez, the three-century-old scribblings that they kept hidden away from the eyes of prying scholars were relics in a reverse sense: talismans of the tyrannic power the Puebloans had wrested from the Spanish in 1680, charms against the oppression they had borne ever returning in full force. </p><p> In any event, all kinds of knowledge of what scholar France V. Scholes called "troublous times in New Mexico" vanished in the bonfires and seizures of 1680. Santa Fe, for instance, was founded in 1610, yet the earliest surviving map of the town was drawn only in 1767. Of course there were earlier maps, but they have disappeared. As a consequence, we do not know precisely where the climactic battle in August 1680 between the Puebloans and Spanish, culminating in the siege of Santa Fe, took place. </p><p> In another respect, the Spanish record is fundamentally unreliable. So sure were the officers and settlers in New Mexico that they carried a superior civilization into the midst of benighted savages, so arrogant were the friars in wielding the absolute truth of their Catholic faith to wipe out the "hideous apostasies" of the native religion, that it is frequently impossible to read between the lines of Spanish dogma to figure out just what was going on at Taos or Jemez or Acoma. </p><p> As for the Pueblo record of the Revolt, it looms for the Anglo scholar of today as a yawning void. An old truism of the Southwest has it that Spanish persecution in New Mexico was so severe that it drove the Pueblo religion (and indeed, the very culture) underground. Underground, it remains today. Yet the secrecy that lies at the heart of Puebloan life goes far deeper than a response to the Spanish. In basic ways, it long predates European contact, forming an intrinsic feature of the culture. In 2004, moreover, it has become harder for an outsider to learn anything new about the Pueblo belief system or Pueblo history than at any time since the 1870s, when Anglo ethnographers began working in the Southwest. </p><p> At the time of Coronado's <i>entrada</i> in 1540, Spain was at the height of its glory, the most powerful nation in Europe and perhaps in the world. Its monarch, Charles I, had been elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1519; as the Hapsburg Charles V, by 1540 he presided over a domain that stretched from the Netherlands to North Africa, from Austria to Mexico and Peru. Charles's reign provided the seedbed for an unprecedented florescence of Spanish culture, bringing forth in subsequent generations such writers as Cervantes and Lope de Vega, such painters as El Greco and Vel�zquez. </p><p> In contrast, by the 1670s, on the eve of the Pueblo Revolt, Spain had become a distinctly second-rate power. She had suffered not only the crushing decimation of her Armada by the British fleet in 1588, but had lost one war after another, in France, in Holland, in Italy, and elsewhere. Catalonia and Portugal had successfully revolted against Castilian rule. Under the feckless Charles II, Spain suffered an irreversible decline. The Venetian ambassador to Spain characterized Charles's reign as "an uninterrupted series of calamities." Thanks to warfare and the exodus of Spaniards to the colonies, the population of Castile itself declined from 6.5 million in 1600 to 5 million in 1680. Beginning in 1677, earthquakes, plague, and crop failures dealt further blows to the mother country. In cultural terms, the vaunted "Golden Century" had come to its close. </p><p> The decline of Spain had a bitter relevance for New M...</p></p><h2>The Ultimate Broadway Fake Book</h2><p>(Fake Book).

There are an increasing number of books on the market about making cheese, but none approaches the intricacies of cheesemaking science alongside considerations for preparing each type of cheese variety in as much detail as <em>Mastering Artisan Cheesemaking</em>.</p> <p>Indeed, this book fills a big hole in the market. Beginner guides leave you wanting more content and explanation of process, while recipe-based cookbooks often fail to dig deeper into the science, and therefore don&#x2019;t allow for a truly intuitive cheesemaker to develop. Acclaimed cheesemaker Gianaclis Caldwell has written the book she wishes existed when she was starting out. Every serious home-scale artisan cheesemaker&#x2015;even those just beginning to experiment&#x2015;will want this book as their bible to take them from their first quick mozzarella to a French mimolette, and ultimately to designing their own unique cheeses.</p> <p>This comprehensive and user-friendly guide thoroughly explains the art and science that allow milk to be transformed into epicurean masterpieces. Caldwell offers a deep look at the history, science, culture, and art of making artisan cheese on a small scale, and includes detailed information on equipment and setting up a home-scale operation. A large part of the book includes extensive process-based recipes dictating not only the hard numbers, but also the concepts behind each style of cheese and everything you want to know about affinage (aging) and using oils, brushes, waxes, infusions, and other creative aging and flavoring techniques. Also included are beautiful photographs, profiles of other cheesemakers, and in-depth appendices for quick reference in the preparation and aging room. <em>Mastering Artisan Cheesemaking</em> will also prove an invaluable resource for those with, or thinking of starting, a small-scale creamery.</p> <p>Let Gianaclis Caldwell be your mentor, guide, and cheering section as you follow the pathway to a mastery of cheesemaking. For the avid home hobbyist to the serious commercial artisan, <em>Mastering Artisan Cheesemaking</em> is an irreplaceable resource.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Gianaclis Caldwell and her family operate Pholia Farm, an off-grid, raw milk cheese dairy in Oregon. She is the author of the award-winning <em>Mastering Artisan Cheesemaking</em>, as well as other books on cheesemaking and running a dairy. Applying a holistic, organic management approach to the health of her goats comes naturally for Gianaclis: She was raised on an organic farm; her parents were chiropractors; and she pursued a career in nursing. Her aged, raw milk cheeses have been recognized and applauded by America&#x2019;s foremost authorities on cheese, and she travels nationwide to present workshops on cheesemaking and troubleshooting goat health problems.</p><p><em><strong> Booklist-</strong></em><br><br>"The first point to make is that this oversize book is stunningly presented, with easy-on-the-eye text, helpfully broken up by subject headings, several on a page. And the photographic illustrations are in rich color and with clear detailing that makes the close-up shots comfortable on the eye as well. This handbook is for readers serious in their interest in and pursuit of home cheesemaking. With authority and clarity, the author delves deeply into the subject, explaining all the scientific aspects of the processes involved (in her words, 'the beautiful interplay of science and art that goes into creating truly great cheeses'), including measuring acid development, aging cheese, adding flavors to cheese, and thinking about various ideas for equipment and work space. Part two is, as the author indicates, where the fun begins. Recipes are offered and explained in very easy terms. A complete package."</p><br><br><p><em><strong> ForeWord Reviews-</strong></em><br><br>"Somewhere between art and science, cheesemaking is not for the faint of heart. Caldwell begins her guide to the enterprise with a great deal of science. An extremely nuanced process becomes friendly through the author&#x2019;s cheery advice and enthusiasm, then the book transitions into recipes that range from simple to quite advanced. A great guide for beginners and experts alike, Caldwell makes sense of the culture of cheese-making. Between recipes and advice, Caldwell gives credit to other experts in the field, pointing to relevant books, suppliers, and masters of the craft. The book also features a useful glossary of terms, an appendices with a troubleshooting guide, quick reference guide, and resources list. The layout is easy to read and well-organized; pictures illustrate what the end product should look like, a useful referent for those new to the process. More experienced cheesemakers will find ample difficulty to suit their study. Recipes start with the history of the cheese, then list ingredients, steps, and large-batch guidelines. From equipment to acidity, humidity to storage, Caldwell takes care to make sense of every step and each element. Throughout the process, she offers multiple options for further study and understanding, encouraging her readers to embrace the art, science, and community of cheesemaking. Caldwell&#x2019;s comforting and impassioned talk of cheese will encourage any student willing to take on the adventure of cheesemaking. With its depth of information, this book will keep on giving as cheesemakers increase their mastery of the craft."</p><br><br><p><em><strong>Bookwatch Review-</strong></em></p> <p>Home hobbyists and any serious about commercial artisans will find <em>Mastering Artisan Cheesemaking</em> the ultimate key to moving from very basic ideas to creating masterpiece cheeses. Recipe-based cheese-making books alone often fail to cover the science and art of small-scale cheese making for all skill levels: this book packs in some thirty basic recipes with profiles of cheesemakers from around the world, information on home-scale equipment and cheese aging, and more. The result is a powerful recommendation that goes far beyond recipes alone to delve into the art and science of cheesemaking.</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Easy to understand and fun to read, <em>Mastering Artisan Cheesemaking</em> provides valuable information on every aspect of cheesemaking&#x2015;an excellent resource for both cheese makers and cheese lovers.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Sally Fallon Morell, President, The Weston A.

Caldwell's voice comes through so clear, friendly, and free of clinicality. I have learned so much that I didn't realize I didn't know. In fact, the book is so good I'm a little embarrassed that I didn't even know how badly I needed it, and feel I am a vastly improved master cheesemonger for having been blessed with reading it."<strong>--Steven Jenkins, author of <em>Cheese Primer</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"If only <em>Mastering Artisan Cheesemaking</em> had been available a decade or so ago--my cheese making adventures would have been a lot less stressful. Already I see this as the new go-to book for my workshop attendees. Gianaclis Caldwell presents her method of making cheese as an intuitive process, and broaches the truly formidable task of the science of cheese making in an understandable way that only someone that has learned in the classroom and worked in the cheese room can. The section on surface ripened cheese is especially good since these cheeses are more difficult to ripen. Go out and get this book, if you haven't already."<strong>--Jim Wallace, New England Cheesemaking Supply Company</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Gianaclis Caldwell has poured her generous mind and heart into this book, and reveals the secret life of one of humanity&#x2019;s most delicious foods. <em>Mastering Artisan Cheesemaking</em> is a wealth of in-depth information won by first-hand experience, yet it&#x2019;s friendly and reassuring and skillfully unpacks the science and craft of cheesemaking for the interested hobbyist and the artisan alike.

Caldwell's practical and straightforward explanations make this entire book (along with its amusing anecdotes) a great pleasure to read. She makes it clear that artisan cheesemaking is a serious endeavor; but her light-hearted approach will remove the fear factor and inspire you to make a go of it anyway. And for everyone who just loves to eat fine artisan cheeses, this book will elevate your respect for all that goes into their creation. Among the recent bounty of books on cheese, this one is a must-have."<strong>--Max McCalman, author of <em>Mastering Cheese</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"I am in awe! For anyone who has ever written a book or sweated over a cheese vat, you know that both require artistry, focus and discipline, dedication, time and more time, and perhaps a bit of creative insanity. Gianaclis Caldwell has either a twin or a clone! As an accomplished artisan enterprise in Southern Oregon, her cheeses from Pholia Farm are beautiful, luscious, and consistently at the top of the game. In her new book, she argues eloquently for the strong relationship between art and science, for deeper understanding and appreciation of milk, and the chemistry and alchemy of a cheese vat. With dozens of recipes, she guides us to create delicious, consistently top-quality cheeses. And as the landscape of American artisan cheese heads towards 1,000 small-scale producers, <em>Mastering Artisan Cheesemaking</em> offers each of them new insights, essential knowledge, and encouragement to experiment and succeed. I deeply admire and respect her ability, standards, and work ethic...now if I could just figure out how she did both!"<strong>--Jeffrey P. Roberts, author of <em>The Atlas of American Artisan Cheese</em></strong> <br> <br> </p><br><br><p>"<em>Mastering Artisan Cheesemaking</em> is a must-have book for the aspiring cheesemaker or cheesemonger. Not only is it amazingly easy to use as a reference book - laying out cheese science in as clear and jargon-free a way as possible - it's also a fun time for the cheese obsessed reader. Why does that rind look like that? How does that cheese get that amazing flavor? I'll admit, this book helped clear up some misperceptions I have held for twenty years about the way certain cheeses are made. I've read this once, but I know I will be referring to it over and over again.<strong>--Gordon Edgar, author of <em>Cheesemonger: A Life on the Wedge</em></strong></p></p><h2>John for Everyone, Part 2 (The New Testament for Everyone)</h2><p><p>Making use of his scholar's understanding, yet writing in an approachable and anecdotal style, Tom Wright manages to unravel the great complexity of the extraordinary Gospel of John.

In the process, he explores key concepts that inform our understanding of the biblical texts, including patriarchy, complementarity, purity and impurity, honor and shame. Central to his argument is the need to uncover the moral logic behind the text.<br><br> Written in order to serve and inform the ongoing debate in many denominations over the questions of homosexuality, Brownson's in-depth study will prove a useful resource for Christians who want to form a considered opinion on this important issue.</p><p>James V. Brownson is James I. and Jean Cook Professor of New Testament at Western Theological Seminary, Holland, Michigan. His other books include <i>Speaking Truth in Love: New Testament Resources for a Missional Hermeneutic.</i><b><i>Search</i></b><br> "Brownson's argument is careful and sensitive. . . . An important addition to the conversation on the Church's response to people in same-sex relationships."<br><br><b><i>Books at a Glance</i></b><br> "[A] thoughtful, complex and comprehensive work."<br><br><b>Wesley Granberg-Michaelson</b>&nbsp;(from foreword)<br> "Instead of being trapped in shallow debates over the meaning of a few isolated biblical passages, James Brownson grounds his approach in foundational biblical understandings of gender and sexuality. He takes the Bible seriously, engaging it faithfully and deeply, and he encourages the reader to do the same. . . . The church needs this book."<br><br><b>David G. Myers</b><br> &#x2014; author of&nbsp;<i>A Friendly Letter to Skeptics and Atheists</i><br> "With gentle wisdom Brownson reveals an implicit moral logic beneath scriptural teachings about sexuality and same-sex relationships. His insights &#x2014; which are both prophetic and pastoral &#x2014; build a much-needed bridge across the sexual divide that separates people of shared biblical faith."<br><br><b>Brian McLaren</b><br> &#x2014; author of&nbsp;<i>Naked Spirituality: A Life with God in 12 Simple Words</i><br> "Jim Brownson has written what I believe is a 'game-changing' book on the hotly disputed topic of same-sex orientation and relationships in light of the Bible. He approaches the biblical texts with no less care and respect than the most conservative or traditional scholars, but he makes overt and clear what many seem unconscious of &#x2014; the&nbsp;<i>moral logic</i>&nbsp;that operates in a text. By surfacing and grappling with that moral logic, Brownson can explore the&nbsp;<i>why</i>&nbsp;behind the&nbsp;<i>what</i>&nbsp;of biblical prohibitions. In so doing, he provides not only a masterful work on human sexuality in light of Scripture, but also a model for the kind of robust and faithful biblical hermeneutic that our churches desperately need at this point in our history."<br><br><b>Peggy Campolo</b><br> &#x2014; speaker, writer, and editor<br> "If ever a book spoke the good news of the gospel with biblical authority to those children of God who happen not to be straight, it is this book. Brownson addresses with clarity an issue that is tearing the church of Jesus Christ apart, as he gently insists that all of us allow new facts and insights to illuminate our understanding of what Scripture has to say to gay and lesbian Christians."<br><br><b><i>Booklist</i>&nbsp;(STARRED review)</b><br> "An outstanding presentation of academic scholarship to general readers. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

This strikes to the heart of the Bible-versus-homosexuality fracas."<br><br><b><i>Englewood Review of Books</i></b><br> "Fascinating and incredibly helpful. It would be hard to suggest that Brownson is anything other than meticulous, transparent, and authentic in his treatment of the issues and of scripture."<br><br><b><i>Studies in Christian Ethics</i></b><br> "Perhaps the greatest challenge facing those seeking to argue a biblical basis for same-sex unions is that &#x2014; in contrast to debates over gender equality or war or remarriage after divorce &#x2014; the canonical evidence is uniformly, often strongly, negative. Brownson's work asks whether there is `anything inherent in the moral logic that shapes the Bible's discussion of one-flesh unions that not only&nbsp;<i>assumes</i>but also&nbsp;<i>requires</i>' (p.106, italics original) such unions to be male and female. Answering in the negative, he has presented the most thorough case so far that one can still be faithful to the Bible by going beyond its explicit witness in this area and appealing to moral logic and cultural change to argue that `what is&nbsp;<i>normal</i>&nbsp;in the biblical witness' &#x2014; only male-female sexual unions &#x2014; `may not necessarily be<i>normative</i>' (p. 109, italics original)."<br><br><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br> "A remarkably thorough, patient, and learned treatment of the knotty questions that surround Christian stances toward same-sex relationships. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [Brownson's] writing and thinking are deliberate and clear, and may supply a crucial tool for discussion based neither on impulse nor unexamined cultural tradition."<br><br><b><i>The Bible Today</i></b><br> "This thoughtful book bears reading as an example of a civil and earnest discussion of a sensitive issue."<br><br><b><i>Theological Studies</i></b><br> "An ambitious challenge to Christians to read the Bible imaginatively if they wish to understand more fully elements found in committed same-sex relationships."<br><br><b><i>Biblical Theology Bulletin</i></b><br> "In the ongoing debate surrounding same-sex relationships in general, and same-sex marriage in particular, James Brownson's recent work is a welcome addition, providing a calm and well-reasoned examination of Christian Scripture that can be appreciated by all sides of the debate. Regardless of whether or not a person ultimately agrees with Brownson's conclusions, readers on all sides should find food for thought at numerous points throughout the book."<br><br><b><i>Review of Biblical Literature</i></b><br> "This work has taken the church forward in its deliberations regarding the same-sex debate, both in terms of the centrality of Scripture and of the concerns that face us today."<br><br><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br> "A thorough discussion. . . . Brownson concludes that it is crucial to frame passages that worry about ancient cultic sexual excess or hierarchical relationships between men and women in the cultural assumptions of their time. These assumptions may be as alien for many today as are those of the ancient Near East on slavery."</p><h2>Restoring the Jewishness of the Gospel: A Message for Christians</h2><p>A book the whole Church needs to read! A challenge to conventional Christian ideas! Clear thinking about neglected questions such as: What central truth, ignored for 1,800 years, must be restored if the Church is to fulfill the Great Commission? How are both the Jews and the Church God s people? Is there a difference between Jew and Gentile in the body of the Messiah? Will God fulfill all of his promises to the Jews? Does the Law of Moses remain in force today? Is the Church anti-Semitic? If so, what can you do about it? Should the Church evangelize Jews today? If so, how? Surprising answers to these and other crucial questions, along with suggestions for godly action, are given in this exciting and insightful book by an Israeli Messianic Jew, a Jew who trusts Yeshua (Jesus).</p><p>David H. Stern, born in Los Angeles in 1935, is the great-grandson of two of the city&#39;s first twenty Jews. He earned a Ph.D. in economics at Princeton University and was a professor at UCLA.

He then received a Master of Divinity degree at Fuller Theological Seminary, did graduate work at the University of Judaism, and was active in the Messianic Jewish movement. In 1979 the Stern family made aliyah (immigrated to Israel); they now live in Jerusalem. Dr. Stern authored the &#34;Messianic Jewish Manifesto&#34; from which &#34;Restoring the Jewishness of the Gospel&#34; is excerpted.

In fact, attempts to avoid pain can often cause more harm than good, both to your body and to your peace of mind. By accepting and learning to live with pain, you can limit the control it exerts over your life. Mindfulness exercises, in particular, can help you transform pain from a life-defining preoccupation to a simple experience.

This sparkling anthology covers the entire span of Twain&#x2019;s inimitable yarn-spinning, from his early broad comedy to the biting satire of his later years.<br><br>Every one of his sixty stories is here: ranging from the frontier humor of &#x201c;The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,&#x201d; to the bitter vision of humankind in &#x201c;The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg,&#x201d; to the delightful hilarity of &#x201c;Is He Living or Is He Dead?&#x201d; Surging with Twain&#x2019;s ebullient wit and penetrating insight into the follies of human nature, this volume is a vibrant summation of the career of&#x2013;in the words of H. L. Mencken&#x2013;&#x201c;the father of our national literature.&#x201d;</p><p>Mark Twain was born Samuel Langhorne Clemens in 1835. He gained national attention as a humorist in 1865 with the publication of "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County," but was acknowledged as a great writer by the literary establishment with <i>The Adventures Of Huckleberry Fin</i>n (1885). In 1880, Twain began promoting and financing the ill-fated Paige typesetter, an invention designed to make the printing process fully automatic. At the height of his naively optimistic involvement in the technological "wonder" that nearly drove him to bankruptcy, he published his satire, <i>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</i> (1889). Plagued by personal tragedy and financial failure, Mark Twain spent the last years of his life in gloom and exasperation, writing fables about "the damned human race."THE NOTORIOUS JUMPING FROG OF CALAVERAS COUNTY<br>IN COMPLIANCE with the request of a friend of mine, who wrote me from the East, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, and inquired after my friend's friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as requested to do, and I hereunto append the result. I have a lurking suspicion that Leonidas W. Smiley is a myth; that my friend never knew such a personage; and that he only conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler about him, it would remind him of his infamous Jim Smiley, and he would go to work and bore me to death with some exasperating reminiscence of him as long and as tedious as it should be useless to me. If that was the design, it succeeded.<br><br>I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the barroom stove of the dilapidated tavern in the decayed mining camp of Angel's, and I noticed that he was fat and baldheaded, and had an expression of winning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. He roused up, and gave me good day. I told him that a friend of mine had commissioned me to make some inquiries about a cherished companion of his boyhood named Leonidas W. Smiley--Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, a young minister of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one time a resident of Angel's Camp. I added that if Mr. Wheeler could tell me anything about this Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel under many obligations to him.<br><br>Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his chair, and then sat down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which follows this paragraph. He never smiled, he never frowned, he never changed his voice from the gentle-flowing key to which he tuned his initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm; but all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnestness and sincerity, which showed me plainly that, so far from his imagining that there was anything ridiculous or funny about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and admired its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in finesse. I let him go on in his own way, and never interrupted him once.<br><br>"Rev. Leonidas W. H'm, Reverend Le--well, there was a feller here once by the name of Jim Smiley, in the winter of '49--or maybe it was the spring of '50--I don't recollect exactly, somehow, though what makes me think it was one or the other is because I remember the big flume warn't finished when he first come to the camp; but anyway, he was the curiousest man about always betting on anything that turned up you ever see, if he could get anybody to bet on the other side; and if he couldn't he'd change sides. Any way that suited the other man would suit him--any way just so's he got a bet, he was satisfied. But still he was lucky, uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner. He was always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be no solit'ry thing mentioned but that feller'd offer to bet on it, and take ary side you please, as I was just telling you. If there was a horse-race, you'd find him flush or you'd find him busted at the end of it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he would bet you which one would fly first; or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be there reg'lar to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and so he was too, and a good man. If he even see a straddle-bug start to go anywheres, he would bet you how long it would take him to get to--to wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for and how long he was on the road. Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley, and can tell you about him. Why, it never made no difference to him--he'd bet on any thing--the dangdest feller. Parson Walker's wife laid very sick once, for a good while, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but one morning he come in, and Smiley up and asked him how she was, and he said she was considerable better--thank the Lord for his inf'nite mercy--and coming on so smart that with the blessing of Prov'dence she'd get well yet; and Smiley, before he thought, says, 'Well, I'll resk two-and-a-half she don't anyway.'<br><br>"Thish-yer Smiley had a mare--the boys called her the fifteen-minute nag, but that was only in fun, you know, because of course she was faster than that--and he used to win money on that horse, for all she was so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or the consumption, or something of that kind. They used to give her two or three hundred yards' start, and then pass her under way; but always at the fag end of the race she'd get excited and desperate like, and come cavorting and straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber, sometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one side among the fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e dust and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and sneezing and blowing her nose--and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down.<br><br>"And he had a little small bull-pup, that to look at him you'd think he warn't worth a cent but to set around and look ornery and lay for a chance to steal something. But as soon as money was up on him he was a different dog; his under-jaw'd begin to stick out like the fo'castle of a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover and shine like the furnaces. And a dog might tackle him and bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw him over his shoulder two or three times, and Andrew Jackson--which was the name of the pup--Andrew Jackson would never let on but what he was satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else--and the bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time, till the money was all up; and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j'int of his hind leg and freeze to it--not chaw, you understand, but only just grip and hang on till they throwed up the sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he harnessed a dog once that didn't have no hind legs, because they'd been sawed off in a circular saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and the money was all up, and he come to make a snatch for his pet holt, he see in a minute how he'd been imposed on, and how the other dog had him in the door, so to speak, and he 'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter discouraged-like, and didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out bad. He give Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it was his fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind legs for him to take holt of, which was his main dependence in a fight, and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It was a good pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if he'd lived, for the stuff was in him and he had genius--I know it, because he hadn't no opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as he could under them circumstances if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when I think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out.<br><br>"Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tomcats and all them kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but he'd match you. He ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'lated to educate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn that frog to jump. And you bet you he did learn him, too. He'd give him a little punch behind, and the next minute you'd see that frog whirling in the air like a doughnut--see him turn one summerset, or maybe a couple, if he got a good start, and come down flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching flies, and kep' him in practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time as fur as he could see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he could do 'most anything--and I believe him. Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster down here on this floor--Dan'l Webster was the name of the frog--and sing out, 'Flies, Dan'l, flies!' and quicker'n you could wink he'd spring straight up and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on the floor ag'in as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with his hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog might do. You never see a frog so modest and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so gifted. And when it come to fair and square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong suit, you understand; and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had traveled and been everywheres all said he laid over any frog that ever they see.<br><br>"Well, Smiley kep' the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to fetch him down-town sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller--a stranger in the camp, he was--come acrost him with his box, and says:<br><br>" 'What might it be that you've got in the box?'<br><br>"And Smiley says, sorter indifferent-like, 'It might be a parrot, or it might be a canary, maybe, but it ain't--it's only just a frog.'<br><br>"And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round this way and that, and says, 'H'm--so 'tis. Well, what's he good for?'<br><br>" 'Well,' Smiley says, easy and careless, 'he's good enough for one thing, I should judge--he can outjump any frog in Calaveras County.'<br><br>"The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look, and give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate, 'Well,' he says, 'I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog.'<br><br>" 'Maybe you don't,' Smiley says. 'Maybe you understand frogs and maybe you don't understand 'em; maybe you've had experience, and maybe you ain't only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I've got my opinion, and I'll resk forty dollars that he can outjump any frog in Calaveras County.'<br><br>"And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad-like, 'Well, I'm only a stranger here, and I ain't got no frog; but if I had a frog, I'd bet you.'<br><br>"And then Smiley says, 'That's all right--that's all right--if you'll hold my box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog.' And so the feller took the box, and put up his forty dollars along with Smiley's, and set down to wait.<br><br>"So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to himself, and then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon and filled him full of quail-shot--filled him pretty near up to his chin--and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him in, and give him to this feller, and says:<br><br>" 'Now, if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his fore paws just even with Dan'l's, and I'll give the word.' Then he says, 'One--two--three--git!' and him and the feller touched up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off lively, but Dan'l give a heave, and hysted up his shoulders--so--like a Frenchman, but it warn't no use--he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as a church, and he couldn't no more stir than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he didn't have no idea what the matter was, of course.<br><br>"The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out at the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder--so--at Dan'l, and says again, very deliberate, 'Well,' he says, 'I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog.'<br><br>"Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long time, and at last he says, 'I do wonder what in the nation that frog throw'd off for--I wonder if there ain't something the matter with him--he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow.' And he ketched Dan'l by the nap of the neck, and hefted him, and says, 'Why blame my cats if he don't weigh five pound!' and turned him upside down and he belched out a double handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man--he set the frog down and took out after the feller, but he never ketched him. And--"<br><br>[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up to see what was wanted.] And turning to me as he moved away, he said: "Just set where you are, stranger, and rest easy--I ain't going to be gone a second."<br><br>But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history of the enterprising vagabond Jim Smiley would be likely to afford me much information concerning the Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and so I started away.<br><br>At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he buttonholed me and recommenced:<br><br>"Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yaller one-eyed cow that didn't have no tail, only just a short stump like a bannanner, and--"</p><h2>Wave</h2><p><p><b><b>One of&nbsp;<i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>'s 10 Best Books of the Year, a <i>Christian Science Monitor</i> Best Nonfiction Book, a <i>Newsday </i>Top 10 Books pick, a <i>People m</i>agazine Top 10 pick, a Good Reads Best Book of the Year, and a <i>Kirkus </i>Best Nonfiction Book<br><br>A National Book Critics Circle Award finalist<br></b></b><br>In 2004, at a beach resort on the coast of Sri Lanka, Sonali Deraniyagala and her family&#x2014;parents, husband, sons&#x2014;were swept away by a tsunami.&nbsp;Only Sonali survived to tell their tale.

We see, hear, and smell two rowdy little boys, their brotherly scuffling, their muddy shoes and grass stains. By confronting and recreating moments that make us laugh and weep, we accept their absence and root for the author not to quit. Difficult to describe, tricky to recommend, this is a bold and wondrous book. In a wounded voice that manages to convey the snide, sarcastic, funny, and fatalistic personality that survives beneath the pain, Deraniyagala slowly pieces together the elements that represent the life--the lives--she lost. And she brings them back. For us, for her, for them. So brave, so beautiful, in these pages Deraniyagala&#x2019;s family is brilliantly alive. And so is she. --<em>Neal Thompson</em><br> <p></p>Sonali Deraniyagala teaches in the Department of Economics at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London.

But when her own five-year-old son, Nathaniel, is traumatized by a sexual assault, Nina and her husband, Caleb, a quiet and methodical stone mason, are shattered, ripped apart by an enraging sense of helplessness in the face of a futile justice system that Nina knows all too well. In a heartbeat, Nina's absolute truths and convictions are turned upside down, and she hurtles toward a plan to exact her own justice for her son -- no matter the consequence, whatever the sacrifice.</p><p>Jodi Picoult received an AB in creative writing from Princeton and a master&#x2019;s degree in education from Harvard.

Loose ends drive me crazy; I have to tidy things up to the point where I can put them behind me and move on to the next case. My boss tells anyone who'll listen that he prefers to hire prosecutors who were waiters and waitresses in former lives -- that is, used to juggling a load. But I worked in the gift-wrapping department of Filene's to put myself through law school, and it shows. <br><br>This morning, I've got a closing on a rape trial and a competency hearing. In the afternoon, I have to meet with a DNA scientist about a bloodstain inside a wrecked car, which revealed brain matter belonging to neither the drunk driver accused of negligent homicide nor the female passenger who was killed. All of this is running through my mind when Caleb sticks his head into the bathroom. The reflection of his face rises like a moon in the mirror. "How's Nathaniel?"<br><br>I turn off the water and wrap a towel around myself. "Sleeping," I say. <br><br>Caleb's been out in his shed, loading his truck. He does stonework -- brick paths, fireplaces, granite steps, stone walls. He smells of winter, a scent that comes to Maine at the same time local apples come to harvest. His flannel shirt is streaked with the dust that coats bags of concrete. "How is his fever?" Caleb asks, washing his hands in the sink.<br><br>"He's fine," I answer, although I haven't checked on my son; haven't even seen him yet this morning. <br><br>I am hoping that if I wish hard enough, this will be true. Nathaniel wasn't really that sick last night, and he wasn't running a temperature above 99 degrees. He didn't seem himself, but that alone wouldn't keep me from sending him to school -- especially on a day when I'm due in court. Every working mother has been caught between this Scylla and Charybdis. I can't give a hundred percent at home because of my work; I can't give a hundred percent at work because of my home; and I live in fear of the moments, like these, when the two collide. <br><br>"I'd stay home, but I can't miss this meeting. Fred's got the clients coming to review the plans, and we're all supposed to put in a good showing." Caleb looks at his watch and groans. "In fact, I was late ten minutes ago." His day starts early and ends early, like most subcontractors. It means that I bear the brunt of getting Nathaniel to school, while Caleb is in charge of the pickup. He moves around me, gathering his wallet and his baseball cap. "You won't send him to school if he's sick..."<br><br>"Of course not," I say, but heat creeps beneath the neck of my blouse. Two Tylenol will buy me time; I could be finished with the rape case before getting a call from Miss Lydia to come get my son. I think this, and in the next second, hate myself for it.<br><br><i>"Nina."</i> Caleb puts his big hands on my shoulders. I fell in love with Caleb because of those hands, which can touch me as if I am a soap bubble certain to burst, yet are powerful enough to hold me together when I am in danger of falling to pieces. <br><br>I slide my own hands up to cover Caleb's. "He'll be fine," I insist, the power of positive thinking. I give him my prosecutor's smile, crafted to convince. "We'll be fine."<br><br>Caleb takes a while to let himself believe this. He is a smart man, but he's methodical and careful. He will finish one project with exquisite finesse before moving on to the next, and he makes decisions the same way. I've spent seven years hoping that lying next to him each night will cause some of his deliberation to rub off, as if a lifetime together might soften both our extremes. <br><br>"I'll get Nathaniel at four-thirty," Caleb says, a line that, in the language of parenting, means what <i>I love you</i> once did. <br><br>I feel his lips brush the top of my head as I work the clasp on the back of my skirt. "I'll be home by six." <i>I love you, too.</i><br><br>He walks toward the door, and when I look up I am struck by pieces of him -- the breadth of his shoulders, the tilt of his grin, the way his toes turn in in his big construction boots. Caleb sees me watching. "Nina," he says, and that smile, it tips even more. "You're late too."<br><br>The clock on the nightstand says 7:41. I have nineteen minutes to rouse and feed my son, stuff him into his clothes and his car seat, and make the drive across Biddeford to his school with enough time to get myself to the superior court in Alfred by 9:00. <br><br>My son sleeps hard, a cyclone in his sheets. His blond hair is too long; he needed a haircut a week ago. I sit on the edge of the bed. What's two seconds more, when you get to watch a miracle? <br><br>I wasn't supposed to get pregnant five years ago. I wasn't supposed to get pregnant, ever, thanks to a butcher of an OB who removed an ovarian cyst when I was twenty-two. When I had been weak and vomiting for weeks, I went to see an internist, certain I was dying from some dread parasite, or that my body was rejecting its own organs. But the blood test said there was nothing wrong. Instead, there was something so impossibly right that for months afterward, I kept the lab results taped to the inside of the medicine cabinet of the bathroom: the burden of proof. <br><br>Nathaniel looks younger when he's asleep, with one hand curled under his cheek and the other wrapped tight around a stuffed frog. There are nights I watch him, marveling at the fact that five years ago I did not know this person who has since transformed me. Five years ago I would not have been able to tell you that the whites of a child's eyes are clearer than fresh snow; that a little boy's neck is the sweetest curve on his body. I would never have considered knotting a dish towel into a pirate's bandanna and stalking the dog for his buried treasure, or experimenting on a rainy Sunday to see how many seconds it takes to explode a marshmallow in the microwave. The face I give to the world is not the one I save for Nathaniel: After years of seeing the world in absolutes, he has taught me how to pick out all the shades of possibility.<br><br>I could lie and tell you that I never would have gone to law school or become a prosecutor if I'd expected to have children. It's a demanding job, one you take home, one you cannot fit around soccer games and nursery school Christmas pageants. The truth is, I have always loved what I do; it's how I define myself: <i>Hello, I'm Nina Frost, assistant district attorney.</i> But I also am Nathaniel's mother, and I wouldn't trade that label for the world. There is no majority share; I am split down the middle, fifty-fifty. However, unlike most parents, who lie awake at night worrying about the horrors that could befall a child, I have the chance to do something about them. I'm a white knight, one of fifty lawyers responsible for cleaning up the state of Maine before Nathaniel makes his way through it.<br><br>Now, I touch his forehead -- <i>cool</i> -- and smile. With a finger I trace the slight bow of his cheek, the seam of his lips. Asleep, he bats my hand away, buries his fists under the covers. "Hey," I whisper into his ear. "We need to get moving." When he doesn't stir, I pull the covers down -- and the thick ammonia scent of urine rises from the mattress. <br><br><i>Not today.</i> But I smile, just like the doctor said to when accidents happen for Nathaniel, my five-year-old who's been toilet trained for three years. When his eyes open -- Caleb's eyes, sparkling and brown and so engaging that people used to stop me on the street to play with my baby in his stroller -- I see that moment of fear when he thinks he's going to be punished. "Nathaniel," I sigh, "these things happen." I help him off the bed and start to peel his damp pajamas from his skin, only to have him fight me in earnest. <br><br>One wild punch lands on my temple, driving me back. "For God's sake, Nathaniel!" I snap. But it's not his fault that I'm late; it's not his fault that he's wet the bed. I take a deep breath and work the fabric over his ankles and feet. "Let's just get you cleaned off, okay?" I say more gently, and he defeatedly slides his hand into mine. <br><br>My son tends to be unusually sunny. He finds music in the stifled sounds of traffic, speaks the language of toads. He never walks when he can scramble; he sees the world with the reverence of a poet. So this boy, the one eyeing me warily over the lip of the tub, is not one I recognize. "I'm not mad at you." Nathaniel ducks his head, embarrassed. "Everyone has accidents. Remember when I ran over your bike last year, with the car? You were upset -- but you knew I didn't mean to do it. Right?" I might as well be talking to one of Caleb's granite blocks. "Fine, give me the silent treatment." But even this backfires; I cannot tease him into a response. "Ah, I know what will make you feel better...you can wear your Disney World sweatshirt. That's two days in a row." <br><br>If he had the option, Nathaniel would wear it every day. In his room, I overturn the contents of every drawer, only to find the sweatshirt tangled in the pile of soiled sheets. Spying it, he pulls it free and starts to tug it over his head. "Hang on," I say, taking it away. "I know I promised, but it's got pee all over it, Nathaniel. You can't go to school in this. It has to be washed first." Nathaniel's lower lip begins to tremble, and suddenly I -- the skilled arbitrator -- am reduced to a plea bargain. "Honey, I swear, I'll wash this tonight. You can wear it for the rest of the week. And all of next week, too. But right now, I need your help. I need us to eat fast, so that we can leave on time. All right?"<br><br>Ten minutes later, we have reached agreement, thanks to my complete capitulation. Nathaniel is wearing the damn Disney World sweatshirt, which has been hand-rinsed, hastily spun through the dryer, and sprayed with a pet deodorizer. Maybe Miss Lydia will have allergies; maybe no one will notice the stain above Mickey's wide smile. I hold up two cereal boxes. "Which one?" Nathaniel shrugs, and by now I'm convinced his silence has less to do with shame than getting a rise out of me. Incidentally, it's working. <br><br>I set him down at the counter with a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios while I pack his lunch. "Noodles," I announce with flair, trying to boost him out of his blue funk. "And...ooh! A drumstick from dinner last night! Three Oreos...and celery sticks, so that Miss Lydia doesn't yell at Mommy again about nutrition pyramids. There." I zip up the insulated pack and put it into Nathaniel's backpack, grab a banana for my own breakfast, then check the clock on the microwave. I give Nathaniel two more Tylenol to take -- it won't hurt him this once, and Caleb will never know. "Okay," I say. "We have to go."<br><br>Nathaniel slowly puts on his sneakers and holds out each small foot to me to have the laces tied. He can zip up his own fleece jacket; shimmy into his own backpack. It is enormous on those thin shoulders; sometimes from behind he reminds me of Atlas, carrying the weight of the world. <br><br>Driving, I slide in Nathaniel's favorite cassette -- the Beatles' <i>White Album,</i> of all things -- but not even "Rocky Raccoon" can snap him out of this mood. Clearly, he's gotten up on the wrong side of the bed -- the wet side, I think, sighing. A tiny voice inside me says I should just be grateful that in approximately fifteen minutes it will be someone else's problem. <br><br>In the rearview mirror, I watch Nathaniel play with the dangling strap of his backpack, pleating it into halves and thirds. We come to the stop sign at the bottom of the hill. "Nathaniel," I whisper, just loud enough to be heard over the hum of the engine. When he glances up, I cross my eyes and stick out my tongue.<br><br>Slowly, slow as his father, he smiles at me. <br><br>On the dashboard, I see that it is 7:56. Four minutes ahead of schedule.<br><br>We are doing even better than I thought.<br><br>The way Caleb Frost sees it, you build a wall to keep something unwanted out...or to hold something precious in. He considers this often when he builds, fitting sparkling granite and craggy limestone into niches, a three-dimensional puzzle drawn thick and straight across the edge of a lawn. He likes to think of the families inside these baileys he constructs: insulated, safe, protected. Of course, this is ridiculous. His stone walls are knee-high, not castle-worthy. They have large gaps in them for driveways and paths and grape arbors. And yet every time he drives past a property he's shaped with his own heavy hands, he pictures the parents sitting down to dinner with their children, harmony wrapping the table like mosquito netting, as if literal foundations might lay the pattern for emotional ones.<br><br>He stands at the edge of the Warren property with Fred, their contractor, as they all wait for Caleb to put on a show. Right now, the land is thick with birches and maples, some tagged to show the potential location of the house and the septic system. Mr. and Mrs. Warren stand so close they are touching. She is pregnant; her belly brushes her husband's hip.<br><br>"Well," Caleb begins. His job is to convince these people that they need a stone wall surrounding their property, instead of the six-foot fence they are also considering. But words are not his specialty; that's for Nina. Beside him, Fred clears his throat, prompting.<br><br>Caleb cannot sweet-talk this couple; he can only see what lies ahead for them: a white Colonial, with a screened porch. A Labrador, leaping to catch monarch butterflies in his mouth. A row of bulbs that will, next year, be tulips. A little girl riding a tricycle, with streamers flying from the handlebars down the length of the drive, until she reaches the barrier Caleb has crafted -- the limit, she has been told, of where she is safe.<br><br>He imagines himself bent over this spot, creating something solid in a space where there had been nothing before. He imagines this family, three of them by then, tucked within these walls. "Mrs. Warren," Caleb asks with a smile, the right words finally coming. "When are you due?"<br><br>In one corner of the playground, Lettie Wiggs is crying. She does this all the time, pretends that Danny socked her when the truth is she just wants to see if she can get Miss Lydia to come running from whatever it is Miss Lydia's doing. Danny knows it too, and Miss Lydia, and everyone, except for Lettie, who cries and cries as if it's going to get her somewhere.<br><br>He walks past her. Walks past Danny, too, who isn't Danny anymore, but a pirate, clinging to a barrel after a shipwreck. "Hey, Nathaniel," says Brianna. "Check this out." She is crouched behind the shed that holds soccer balls as soft as ripe melons, and the ride-on bulldozer that you can only ride on for five minutes before it's someone else's turn. A silver spider has stretched a web from the wood to the fence behind it, zagged like a shoelace. At one spot a knot the size of a dime is tangled in the silk.<br><br>"That's a fly." Cole pushes his glasses up on his nose. "The spider, she wrapped it up for her dinner."<br><br>"That's so gross," Brianna says, but she leans closer.<br><br>Nathaniel stands with his hands in his pockets. He thinks about the fly, how it stepped onto the web and got stuck, like the time Nathaniel walked into a snowdrift last winter and lost his boot in the muck at the bottom. He wonders if the fly was just as scared as Nathaniel had been of coming in barefoot through the snow, of what his mother would say. Probably the fly had just figured it was going to take a rest. Probably it had stopped for a second to see how the sun looked like a rainbow through that web, and the spider grabbed him before he could get away.<br><br>"Bet she eats the h...</p><h2>Give Me Tomorrow</h2><p><b>An epic story of valor and sacrifice by a legendary Marine company in the Korean War brought to gripping, cinematic light by an acclaimed historian ("Gives the brave Marines of George Company long overdue recognition"--<i>New York Post</i>) </b><br>"What would you want if you could have any wish?" asked the photojournalist of the haggard, bloodied Marine before him. The Marine gaped at his interviewer. The photographer snapped his picture, which became the iconic Korean War image featured on this book's jacket. "Give me tomorrow," he said at last.<br><br>After nearly four months of continuous and agonizing combat on the battlefields of Korea, such a simple request seemed impossible. For many men of George Company, or "Bloody George" as they were known-one of the Forgotten War's most decorated yet unrecognized companies-it was a wish that would not come true.<br> This is the untold story of "Bloody George," a Marine company formed quickly to answer its nation's call to duty in 1950. This small band of men-a colorful cast of characters, including a Native American fighting to earn his honor as a warrior, a Southern boy from Tennessee at odds with a Northern blue-blood reporter-turned-Marine, and a pair of twins who exemplified to the group the true meaning of brotherhood-were mostly green troops who had been rushed through training to fill America's urgent need on the Korean front. They would find themselves at the tip of the spear in some of the Korean War's bloodiest battles.<br> After storming ashore at Inchon and fighting house-to-house in Seoul, George Company, one of America's last units in reserve, found itself on the frozen tundra of the Chosin Reservoir facing elements of an entire division of Chinese troops. They didn't realize it then, but they were soon to become crucial to the battle-modern-day Spartans called upon to hold off ten times their number. <i>Give Me Tomorrow </i>is their unforgettable story of bravery and courage.<br> Thoroughly researched and vividly told, <i>Give Me Tomorrow</i> is fitting testament to the heroic deeds of George Company. They will never again be forgotten.<br></p><p>"To understand what it means to commit body, mind and spirit to the defense<br>of our country under the most arduous conditions, we only need to read&nbsp;<i><b>Give&nbsp;<br>Me Tomorrow.</b></i><b>&nbsp;The legacy of brotherhood, the spirit of commitment and the example of sacrifice in George Company's hellish fight reminds us all the cost to keep alive our experiment in democracy."<br>--<strong>General James N. Mattis, USMC, Commander of U.S. Central Command</strong></b>If I were God, what would you want for Christmas? asked the war correspondent. The haggard and bloodied marine responded, Give me tomorrow. After nearly four months of continuous and bloody combat in Korea, such a wish seemed impossible. For many of the men of George Company, or Bloody George - one of the war&#39;s most decorated yet unrecognized companies - this would be their last day. This is the epic story of George Company, Spartans for the modern age. After storming ashore at Inchon and fighting house-to-house in Seoul, America&#39;s last reserve unit found itself on the frozen tundra of the Chosin Reservoir facing an entire division of Chinese troops. Little did this small band of men know they would soon be saviors. This is their story, and it will never again be forgotten.</p><h2>Prefabulous Small Houses</h2><p><p><strong>Prefab home construction has come into its own.</strong></p> <p>Prefabricated homes used to be considered inferior to houses built on site, but not anymore.

I never imagined decades later, I would be fighting the same battle.</p> <p>After years of talk and political paralysis, we have reached a tipping point, climate change is no longer a problem of the future, we are experiencing the results of a warming planet all around us, rising seas, widening deserts and deadly wildfires. We are losing control of our future. Our civilization is threatened today by changes that have been taking place over decades.</p> <p>Climate change affects everyone, in every country. Climate change is in everybody's backyard. Only by acting now and standing together can we tip the scales and achieve the results necessary to make the planet a healthy and safe place to live--for now and for the future. At one time energy conversation was only about oil, coal and gas. Now people are talking about renewable energy--how it can result in cheaper and plentiful energy, and the positive role this can play on the environment.</p> <p>Climate change presents us with a huge challenge, how to move a society that has been dependent on fossil fuels to a future that is cleaner and more sustainable.</p> <p>While it is easy to become discouraged there is reason for optimism. There is a groundswell occurring and it's rising from the ground up. Leadership is coming from people themselves. We have the opportunity to re-think how we live in this world now and for future generations.</p> <p>I have great faith in the power of innovation and the ingenuity of people from all walks of life to solve this problem. Technological advances are well under way--renewable energy, increased efficiency and innovation in building practices are gaining momentum.</p> <p>One way to reduce the need and desire for fossil fuel is to design houses that require less fuel to build, operate, and to heat and cool. When houses are thoughtfully built this way, the energy requirement is vastly reduced. Renewable energy that uses solar thermal panels, photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, and geothermal systems--combined with good design--creates houses that require no fossil fuel.</p> <p>We know that 38 to 40 percent of the energy in this country is used to heat and cool our buildings-residential and commercial. This old way is expensive, dirty, and a proven danger to life. Yet it's a problem with a solution. But we must decide to apply that solution now.</p> <p>This book advocates for smaller houses, which is a strong trend in this country. Smaller houses reduce wasted space that most people don't need or use. Smaller, better-built houses teach us to curb our appetite for energy, and lessen our need to build, heat, cool, and maintain that extra space we don't need or even want. Building smaller, along with building houses prefabricated--in the process using less time, fewer materials, and using both more efficiently--is the sanest and wisest recipe for home construction, for now and for the future.</p> (Robert Redford)</p><h2>The Bride</h2><p>By edict of the king, the mighty Scottish laird Alec Kincaid must take an English bride.

It was a most unfortunate remark for a father to make in front of his daughters, and Baron Jamison realized his blunder as soon as the words were out of his mouth. He was, of course, immediately made sorry for blurting out his unkind comment. </p><p> Three of his four daughters had already taken to heart the foul gossip about Alec Kincaid. They didn't much care for their father's view on the atrocity, either. The baron's twins, Agnes and Alice, wept loudly and, as was their particularly irritating habit, in unison as well, while their usually sweet-tempered sister Mary marched a brisk path around the oblong table in the great hall, where their confused father sat slumped over a goblet of guilt-soothing ale. In between the twins' noisy choruses of outrage, his gentle little Mary interjected one sinful tattle after another she'd heard about the Highland warrior who would be arriving at their home in a paltry week's time. </p><p> Mary, deliberately or nay, was stirring the twins into a full lather of snorting and screeching. It was enough to try the patience of the devil himself. </p><p> Papa tried to give the Scotsman his full defense. Since he'd never actually met the warrior, or heard anything but ill, unrepeatable rumors about the man's black character, he was therefore forced to make up all his favorable remarks. </p><p> And all for naught. </p><p> Aye, it was wasted effort on his part, for his daughters weren't paying the least attention to what he was saying. That shouldn't have surprised him, he realized with a grunt and a good belch; his angels never listened to his opinions. </p><p> The baron was terribly inept at soothing his daughters when they were in a state, a fact that hadn't particularly bothered him until today. Now however, he felt it most important to gain the upper hand. He didn't want to look the fool in front of his uninvited guests, be they Scots or nay, and fool he'd certainly be called if his daughters continued to ignore his instructions. </p><p> After downing a third gulp of ale, the baron summoned up a bit of gumption. He slammed his fist down on the wooden table as an attention-getter, then announced that all this talk about the Scotsman being a murderer was nonsense. </p><p> When that statement didn't get any reaction or notice, his irritation got the better of him. All right, then, he decided, if all the gossip turned true, then mayhap the Scotsman's wife had been deserving of the foul deed. It had probably just started out as a proper thrashing, he speculated, and as things had a way of doing, the beating had gotten a wee bit out of hand. </p><p> That explanation made perfectly good sense to Baron Jamison. His comments gained him an attentive audience, too, but the incredulous looks on his daughters' faces weren't the result he'd hoped to accomplish. His precious angels stared at him in horror, as if they'd just spotted a giant leech hanging off the tip of his nose. They thought him daft, he suddenly realized. The baron's weak temper exploded full measure then, and he bellowed that the sorry woman had probably sassed her lord back once too often. It was a lesson that his disrespectful daughters would do well to take to heart. </p><p> The baron had only meant to put the fear of God and father into his daughters. He knew he'd failed in the extreme when the twins started shouting again. The sound made his head ache. He cupped his hands over his ears to block out the grating noise, then closed his eyes against the hot glare Mary was giving him. The baron actually slumped lower in his chair, until his knobby knees were scraping the floor. His head was bent, his gumption gone, and in desperation, he turned to his faithful servant, Herman, and ordered him to fetch his youngest daughter. </p><p> The gray-haired servant looked relieved by the order, nodding several times before shuffling out of the room to do his lord's bidding. The baron could have sworn on the Holy Cross that he heard the servant mutter under his breath that it was high time that order was given. </p><p> A scant ten minutes elapsed before the baron's namesake walked into the middle of the chaos. Baron Jamison immediately straightened in his chair. After giving Herman a good glare to let him know he'd heard his whispered criticism, he let go of his scowl. And when he turned to watch his youngest, he let out a long sigh of relief. </p><p> His Jamie would take charge. </p><p> Baron Jamison realized he was smiling now, then admitted to himself that it just wasn't possible to stay sour when his Jamie was near. </p><p> She was such a bewitching sight, so pleasing to look upon, in fact, that a man could forget all his worries. Her presence was as commanding as her beauty, too. Jamie had been endowed with her mama's handsome looks. She had long raven-colored hair, violet eyes that reminded her papa of springtime, and skin as flawless and pure as her heart. </p><p> Although the baron boasted of loving all his daughters, in secret, Jamie was his pride and joy. It was a most amazing fact, considering he wasn't her true blood father. Jamie's mother was the baron's second wife. She had come to him when she was nearly full term with her daughter. The man who'd fathered Jamie had died in battle, a bare month after wedding and bedding his bride. </p><p> The baron had accepted the infant as his own, forbidding anyone to refer to her as his stepdaughter. From the moment he'd first held her in his arms, she had belonged to him. </p><p> Jamie was the youngest and the most magnificent of his angels. The twins, and Mary as well, were gifted with a quiet beauty, the kind that grew on a man with time and notice, but his dear little Jamie, with just one look, could fairly knock the wind out of a man. Her smile had been known to nudge a knight clear off his mount, or so her papa liked to exaggerate to his friends. </p><p> Yet there was no petty jealousy among his girls. Agnes, Alice, and Mary instinctively turned to their little sister for guidance in all matters of significance. They leaned on her almost as often as their papa did. </p><p> Jamie was now the true mistress of their home. Since the day of her mama's burial, his youngest had taken on that burden. She'd proven her value early, and the baron, liking order but having no gift for establishing it, had been most relieved to give Jamie full responsibility. </p><p> She never disappointed him. Jamie was such a sensible, untroubling daughter. She never cried, either, not since the day her mama passed on. Agnes and Alice would have done well to learn from their sister's disciplined nature, the baron thought. They tended to cry over just about everything. To his mind, their looks saved them from being completely worthless, but still he pitied the lords who would someday be saddled with his emotional daughters. </p><p> The baron worried most for his Mary. Though he never voiced the criticism, he knew she was a might more selfish than was considered fashionable. She put her own wants above those of her sisters. The bigger sin, however, was putting herself above her papa. </p><p> Aye, Mary was a worry, and a mischief-maker, too. She liked to plow up trouble just for the sheer joy of it. The baron had a nagging suspicion that Jamie was giving Mary unladylike ideas, but he never dared voice that notion, lest he be proven wrong, and fall from grace in his youngest's eyes. </p><p> Yet even though Jamie was his favorite, the baron wasn't completely oblivious to her flaws. Her temper, though seldom unleashed, could ignite a forest fire. She had a stubborn crook in her nature, too. She had inherited her mama's skill for healing, even though he'd specifically forbidden that practice. Nay, the baron wasn't pleased with that inclination, for the serfs and the house servants were constantly pulling her away from her primary duty of seeing to his comforts. Jamie was dragged out of her bed during the mi</p></p><h2>The Exiled Queen (Seven Realms)</h2><p>Haunted by the loss of his mother and sister, Han Alister journeys south to begin his schooling at Mystwerk House in Oden's Ford. But leaving the Fells doesn't mean that danger isn't far behind. Han is hunted every step of the way by the Bayars, a powerful wizarding family set on reclaiming the amulet Han stole from them. And Mystwerk House has dangers of its own. There, Han meets Crow, a mysterious wizard who agrees to tutor Han in the darker parts of sorcery-but the bargain they make is one Han may regret. <br><br>Meanwhile, Princess Raisa <i>ana</i>'Marianna runs from a forced marriage in the Fells, accompanied by her friend Amon and his triple of cadets. Now, the safest place for Raisa is Wein House, the military academy at Oden's Ford. If Raisa can pass as a regular student, Wein House will offer both sanctuary and the education Raisa needs to succeed as the next Gray Wolf queen. <br><br>Everything changes when Han and Raisa's paths cross, in this epic tale of uncertain friendships, cut-throat politics, and the irresistible power of attraction.</p><p><strong>Cinda Williams Chima</strong> (www.cindachima.com) is the <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author of <em>The Warrior Heir</em>, <em>The Wizard Heir</em>, <em>The Dragon Heir,</em> and the first book in the Seven Realms series<em>, The Demon King.</em> She wrote her first novels in middle school. Cinda is a graduate of The University of Akron and Case Western Reserve University. She lives in Ohio with her family.Gr 8 Up&#x2013;Seventeen-year-old Han Alister was once the Ragmarket street lord, skilled in thievery and lies. But now he's traveling to Oden's Ford to earn an education in the magical arts, and it will not be without peril. Despite the fact that the academy is known as &#x201c;the great leveler,&#x201d; there are students who have reason to hate Han, specifically the Bayar twins, Micah and Fiona, because he stole the Demon King's amulet from their father, the High Wizard. To gain the upper hand on them, Han joins forces with a mysterious wizard he met in the dream world, but what this wizard asks in return may be more than the teen wishes to give. Meanwhile, Princess Raisa has fled from an arranged marriage with Micah Bayar. She and her loyal&#x2013;and beloved&#x2013;soldier, Amon, are also making their way to Oden's Ford so that Raisa might receive a military education in order to become a stronger ruler. Raisa's and Han's paths have crossed in the past, but when they meet again their connection is more powerful than before. Chima has created an intricate world with a rich history, cultural prejudices, and complicated political dynamics. Her characters are multifaceted: no one is either completely evil or insipidly perfect&#x2013;each has shortcomings as well as redeeming traits. Readers would do well to pick up the first book in this series before tackling this one, as there are some details that will be lost without knowledge of what transpired in The Demon King (Hyperion, 2009), but those who love a well-thought-out fantasy will enjoy this novel.<i>Heather M.

The holidays were approaching so it seemed the perfect time. He scoffed, &#x201c;A Christmas album?! That&#x2019;s what people do when they&#x2019;re washed-up.&#x201d; Though we didn&#x2019;t agree (and neither does Mariah Carey), I have to admit that I shared the boyfriend&#x2019;s skepticism. It just seemed, well, cheesy. This probably explains my dubiousness when I discovered that Jeanette Winterson had penned a collection of Christmas stories, despite the fact that she is one of my favorite authors. But I am not ashamed to say, <em>Christmas Days</em> melted my cynical heart. There are twelve tales, of course, every one infectious with Winterson&#x2019;s enthusiasm for the season. This is not to say that all of the stories are joyful. She slips a couple delightfully spooky ones into the mix, and there are accompanying holiday recipes as well. Again, not typically a fan of the story/recipe combo, but this book is breaking all of my literary rules because it&#x2019;s just...well, magic. There, I said it. With feeling! In the introduction, Winterson writes: &#x201c;I know Christmas has become a cynical retail hijack but it is up to us all, individually and collectively, to object to that. Christmas is celebrated across the world by people of all religions and none. It is a joining together, a putting aside of differences.&#x201d; On the heels of such a contentious presidential election, a lot of folks are apprehensive about holing-up with family this holiday season. My advice? Leave politics at the door, watch <em>Elf</em> for the tenth time, and begin the tradition of reading <em>Christmas Days</em>--to yourself, to your loved ones (preferably by a fire with some hot cocoa). At the very least it will warm the cockles of your (cold/terrified/hopeful) heart. <em>--Erin Kodicek, The Amazon Book Review</em>Born in Manchester, England, <b>Jeanette Winterson</b> is the author of seventeen books, including the national bestseller <i>Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?</i>, <i>Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit</i>, <i>Sexing the Cherry</i>, and <i>The Passion</i>.

Some of our ancestors were driven by dreams and hope. Others came in chains, or were escaping poverty or persecution. No matter what brought them here, each person embodied a unique gift&#x2014;their art and music, their determination and grit, their stories and their culture. And together they forever shaped the country we all call home. Vividly expressed in Faith Ringgold&#x2019;s sumptuous colors and patterns, <i>We Came to America</i> is an ode to every American who came before us, and a tribute to each child who will carry its proud message of diversity into our nation&#x2019;s future. <br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> PRAISE FOR<b> <i>WE CAME TO AMERICA</i>:</b><br><br>**A 2017 Notable Social Studies Trade Book for Young People**&nbsp; <br><br> <b>&#x201c;As Americans wrestle with the moral and legal aspects of immigration, Ringgold offers a reminder of the country&#x2019;s multifaceted lineage&#x2014;and of the beauty to be discovered at cultural crossroads</b>....

She received a degree in art education from the City College of New York and was an art teacher long before she became a professional artist. She is best known for her pained story quilts, some of which hang in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City. <i>Tar Beach</i>, Ringgold&#x2019;s first book for children, won the Coretta Scott King Award for illustration and was named a Caldecott honor Book.

The artist has repurposed a title she applied in 1997 to a story quilt; it featured a revolt on a slave ship whose beacon was a black Statue of Liberty. Here she broadens her scope. After she acknowledges that "some of us were already here" and "some of us were brought in chains," her free verse unfolds with a line or two on each page touching on reasons for immigration and the solace and joy found in sharing "our food, our fashion, and our art...." A refrain emphasizing the country's ethnic and religious plurality punctuates the occasionally rhyming stanzas. The poem is paired with tableaux of families from various time periods and places, as if their portraits were captured the moment they stepped on American soil. Vibrant paint on canvas provides a changing, high contrast backdrop for the parade of patterns and styles, from the bold geometrics of African cloth and the pinstriped suits and fedoras of Europe to the decorative tunics and elaborate headdresses of Eastern communities. A final scene depicting a gathering of diverse children concludes that despite differences, "we are ALL Americans,/Just the same." While the message is a time-honored one, it clearly needs to be foregrounded. VERDICT The simplicity of Ringgold's text, combined with the captivating designs, makes this a compelling, must-have narrative for a wide audience.&#x2014;Wendy Lukehart, District of Columbia Public Library</p><h2>Messages of Hope: The Metaphysical Memoir of a Most Unexpected Medium</h2><p>Are there dimensions of existence beyond the material world?

He has earned two Edgar Award nominations and was the 2012 recipient of the Poirot Award from Malice Domestic.1<br><br>FBI Special Agent Kate O&#x2019;Hare slouched back in her tan leather executive office chair, looked across her desk, and surveyed the lobby of the Tarzana branch of California Metro Bank. The desk actually belonged to the assistant manager. Kate was occupying it because she was waiting for the bank to get robbed. She&#x2019;d been waiting for four days, and she was wishing it would happen soon, because she was going gonzo with boredom.<br><br>The boredom vanished and her posture improved when two businessmen wearing impeccably tailored suits walked through the bank&#x2019;s double glass doors. One of the men wore Ray-�Bans and had a Louis Vuitton backpack slung over his shoulder. The other man was stylishly unshaven and had a raincoat draped casually over his right arm. It hadn&#x2019;t rained in L.A. in two months, and no rain was expected, so Kate figured these might be the guys she&#x2019;d been waiting for, and that at least one of them wasn&#x2019;t all that good at hiding a weapon.<br><br>The man wearing the Ray-�Bans went directly into the manager&#x2019;s glass-�walled office, and the man with the raincoat approached Kate&#x2019;s desk and sat down across from her. His gaze immediately went to her chest, which was entirely understandable, as she was wearing a push-�up bra under her Ann Taylor pantsuit that made her breasts burst out of her open blouse like Poppin&#x2019; Fresh dough. This wasn&#x2019;t a favored look for Kate, but she was the job, and if it took cleavage to capture some slimeball, then she was all about it.<br><br>&#x201c;May I help you, sir?&#x201d; Kate asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Call me Slick,&#x201d; the man said.<br><br>&#x201c;Slick?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Really?&#x201d;<br><br>He shrugged and adjusted the raincoat so that she could see the Sig Sauer 9mm semiautomatic underneath it. &#x201c;Keep smiling and relax. I&#x2019;m simply a businessman talking to you about opening a new account.&#x201d;<br><br>Kate glanced toward the office of the manager. FBI Special Agent Seth Ryerson was behind the manager&#x2019;s desk, and the real manager was working as one of the bank&#x2019;s four tellers. The Ray-�Bans guy was giving Ryerson instructions. Ryerson turned to look at Kate, and she could see that sweat was already beading on his balding head. As soon as any action started, Ryerson always broke out in a sweat. In five minutes, he&#x2019;d be soaked. It was never pretty.<br><br>Kate and Ryerson had been working undercover, following a tip, hoping the men would show up. The bank fit the profile of the six other San Fernando Valley banks the Businessman �Bandits had held up over the last two months. The Tarzana bank was a stand-�alone building in a largely residential area and was within a block of a freeway on-�ramp and a major interchange.<br><br>Kate knew there was a third &#x201c;businessman&#x201d; in a car idling in the parking lot. She also knew that an FBI strike team was parked around the corner waiting to move in.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you want me to do?&#x201d; Kate asked Slick.<br><br>&#x201c;Sit there and be pretty. Here&#x2019;s how it&#x2019;s going to work, sweetie. My associate is telling your manager to take the backpack to the vault and bring it back filled with cash or I will put a bullet in your chest. My associate will then leave the bank, but I will stick around for a minute flirting with you. If any dye packs explode, or any alarms go off, I will shoot you. If nothing goes wrong, I&#x2019;ll simply get up and walk out the door, no harm done. All you have to do is stay calm, and this will all be over soon.&#x201d;<br><br>It was the same speech he&#x2019;d given to the women at the other banks the Businessman Bandits had held up. Slick always picked a young woman with cleavage to threaten with his gun, which was why Kate had worn the push-�up bra. She&#x2019;d wanted to be his target.<br><br>Kate looked past Slick to the lobby and the bank tellers. There were seven customers in the bank, four at the counter and three in line. No one seemed to notice that anything unusual was happening. Ryerson left the Ray-�Bans guy in his office and took the Vuitton backpack to the vault.<br><br>Kate&#x2019;s iPhone vibrated on her desk. james bond showed up on the caller ID.<br><br>&#x201c;Ignore it,&#x201d; Slick said. &#x201c;Look at me instead.&#x201d;<br><br>Kate shifted her gaze back to Slick&#x2019;s carefully unshaven face, his stubble a shadow on his thin cheeks and sharp chin. The phone went still. After fifteen seconds it began to vibrate again. James Bond wasn&#x2019;t a man who gave up easily.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s annoying,&#x201d; Slick said. &#x201c;Do you always take personal phone calls during work hours?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If they&#x2019;re important.&#x201d;<br><br>The phone continued to vibrate.<br><br>&#x201c;Shut it off,&#x201d; Slick said. &#x201c;Now.&#x201d;<br><br>Kate shut the phone down. A moment later her desk phone rang.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like this,&#x201d; Slick said. &#x201c;On your feet. We&#x2019;re walking out of here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a phone call,&#x201d; Kate said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s probably my mother.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Up!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And start walking. If anyone approaches you, I&#x2019;m shooting you first and then whoever else gets in my way. Clear?&#x201d;<br><br>This isn&#x2019;t good, Kate thought. There were customers �conducting business, coming and going, and there was a possibility that one of them would accidentally cross their path.<br><br>&#x201c;Should I take my purse?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Won&#x2019;t it look odd if I walk out of the bank without my purse?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The bottom drawer, to my right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stay where you are, and I&#x2019;ll open the drawer. Do not move.&#x201d;<br><br>He stood and moved around the desk, all the while keeping his eyes on Kate. He held the Sig in his right hand and reached down to open the drawer with his left. The instant his attention shifted from Kate to the drawer, she smacked him hard in the face with her keyboard. His eyes went blank, the gun dropped from his hand, blood gushed out of his smashed nose, and he crashed to the floor, unconscious.<br><br>Kate picked the gun up and aimed it at his partner in the manager&#x2019;s office.<br><br>&#x201c;FBI!&#x201d; she yelled. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t move. Put your hands on your head.&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Ray-�Bans did as he was told. Everyone in the bank froze, too, startled by her outburst and shocked by the sight of her holding the gun.<br><br>Ryerson rushed out of the vault, his gun drawn, big sweat stains under his armpits. He looked confused. &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I had to go to Plan B,&#x201d; Kate said. She turned to the �customers in the bank. &#x201c;Relax, everyone. We have the situation entirely under control, and you aren&#x2019;t in any danger.&#x201d;<br><br>Kate&#x2019;s desk phone wouldn&#x2019;t stop ringing. She kept her gun aimed at Mr. Ray-�Bans in the manager&#x2019;s office, and snatched at the phone with her other hand.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Is that any way to talk to James Bond?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not James Bond.&#x201d;<br><br>It was Nick Fox, and truth is, Kate thought Nick was pretty darn close to James Bond. A little younger and mostly on the other side of the law, but just as lethal and just as sexy.<br><br>Fox was a world-�class con man and thief. Kate had tracked him for years and finally captured him, only to have her boss, Carl Jessup, and Fletcher Bolton, the deputy director of the FBI, arrange Nick&#x2019;s escape. In return for conditional freedom, Nick had agreed to use his unique skills to nail big-�time criminals the Bureau couldn&#x2019;t catch using conventional means.<br><br>Kate had been given the unwanted responsibility of helping Nick neutralize the bad guys. She was also supposed to make sure Nick didn&#x2019;t go back to his life of crime. The Bureau didn&#x2019;t have Nick under constant surveillance or wearing a tracking device between assignments, so it was up to Kate to keep him on a loose leash. It had been a few days since she&#x2019;d last spoken to him.<br><br>&#x201c;Did I catch you at a bad time?&#x201d; Nick asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. What do you want?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d;<br><br>Kate went silent for a beat. She had no clue what he was �talking about, but whatever it was, at least he hadn&#x2019;t done it. That was good, right?<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m kind of busy right now,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;No problem. I just thought you&#x2019;d want to know.&#x201d;<br><br>Kate hung up, and the phone rang again. It was Carl Jessup.<br><br>&#x201c;Your cellphone isn&#x2019;t working,&#x201d; Jessup said.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because I&#x2019;m in the middle of a bank robbery thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a big problem,&#x201d; Jessup said in his distinctive �Kentucky twang. &#x201c;Yesterday, Nicolas Fox stole a five-�million-�dollar Matisse from the Gleaberg Museum of Art in Nashville.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you sure it was Nick?&#x201d; she asked, watching as Ryerson called in the troops and cuffed Mr. Ray-�Bans.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just texted you a photo from one of the museum&#x2019;s �security cameras.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Jerusalem Bible: Reader&#39;s Edition</h2><p>When it comes to Bible translations, readability and reliability are what count; and on both counts, the original JERUSALEM BIBLE stands alone. A product of the age of the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), THE JERUSALEM BIBLE (published in 1966) was the first truly modern Bible for Catholics. Using definitive original language texts such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, biblical scholars of L'�cole Biblique in Jerusalem produced a meticulously accurate, wonderfully readable French translation of the complete canon of Scripture (La Bible de J�rusalem). From this French original came the English edition, edited by renowned Bible scholar Alexander Jones.<br><br>For all the people around the world who are discovering or revisiting the mysteries contained in the Scriptures, only a clear, understandable Bible translation will do. With language as exquisite but more modern than the King James Version, THE JERUSALEM BIBLE is the one they can trust.</p><p>Praise for THE JERUSALEM BIBLE (1966 edition):<br><br>"This is one of those really monumental works.--There is just nothing like it in English, and I will not live long enough to see anything like it."--Father J.

Stems of aromatic plants are used to make skewers. Selected rocks become grinding stones, griddles, or plates. Even fallen leaves and other natural materials from the forest floor can be utilized to impart a truly local flavor to meats and vegetables, one that captures and expresses the essence of season and place.</p> <p>This beautifully photographed book offers up dozens of creative recipes and instructions for preparing a pantry full of preserved foods, including Pickled Acorns, White Sage-Lime Cider, Wild Kimchi Spice, Currant Capers, Infused Salts with Wild Herbs, Pine Needles Vinegar, and many more. And though the author&#x2019;s own palette of wild foods are mostly common to southern California, readers everywhere can apply Baudar&#x2019;s deep foraging wisdom and experience to explore their own bioregions and find an astonishing array of plants and other materials that can be used in their own kitchens.</p> <p><em>The New Wildcrafted Cuisine</em> is an extraordinary book by a passionate and committed student of nature, one that will inspire both chefs and adventurous eaters to get creative with their own local landscapes.</p></p><p><p>Pascal Baudar is the author of <em>The Wildcrafting Brewer</em> and <em>The New Wildcrafted Cuisine</em>. A wild food researcher and instructor in traditional food preservation techniques, he has introduced thousands of home cooks, local chefs, and foodies to the flavors offered by their wild landscapes.

In vivid, poetic language, he presents the timeless story of a noble family moving toward catastrophe, dragged down from wealth and power by pride, cursed with incest, suicide, and murder.<br><br>William Carlos Williams called the Roche translation of Antigone&nbsp;&#x201c;brilliantly successful...as spirited and powerful as the original must have been.&#x201d; Roche's versions of the Oedipus plays are both stunning and sympathetic, awe-inspiring and intimate, and bring the elemental myths of ancient Greece to life for modern readers.<br><br>Included in this edition are a glossary of classical names, notes on pronunciation and meter, suggestions for production and acting, and historical material, which offer the reader a greater appreciation of Sophocles' dramatic genius.</p><p><b>Sophocles</b> was born at Colonus, just outside Athens, in 496 BC, and lived ninety years. His long life spanned the rise and decline of the Athenian Empire; he was a friend of Pericles, and though not an active politician he held several public offices, both military and civil. The leader of a literary circle and friend of Herodotus, he was interested in poetic theory as well as practice, and he wrote a prose treatise <i>On the Chorus</i>. He seems to have been content to spend all his life at Athens, and is said to have refused several invitations to royal courts.<br><br>Sophocles first won a prize for tragic drama in 468, defeating the veteran Aeschylus. He wrote over a hundred plays for the Athenian theater, and is said to have come first in twenty-four contests. Only seven of his tragedies are now extant, these being <i>Ajax</i>, <i>Antigone</i>, <i>Oedipus the King</i>, <i>Women of Trachis</i>, <i>Electra</i>, <i>Philoctetes</i>, and the posthumous <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i>. A substantial part of <i>The Searches</i>, a satyr play, was recovered from papyri in Egypt in modern times. Fragments of other plays remain, showing that he drew on a wide range of themes; he also introduced the innovation of a third actor in his tragedies.

Six years later she made her first suicide attempt, then wandered the streets of New York City dressed in ragged clothes, tormenting voices crying out in her mind.

But against all odds, she survived.<br><br>In this personal account, she tells how she did it, taking us not only into her own shattered world, but drawing on the words of the doctors who treated her and family members who suffered with her.<br><br><i>*Includes reading group guide*</i><br></p><p>Joe Amaral was born in Portugal on the island of St. Miguel and emigrated with his family to Toronto, Ontario, when he was two years old.

Mary Beth Hurt, as Lori, gives a convincing performance. Her pleasantly resonant voice conveys the confusion, terror, denial, hope and determination experienced by this patient. The narrative is well paced and the terrifying and demoralizing &#34;voices&#34; that were ever present are especially well vocalized. Although Mary Beth Hurt is the principal reader, others portray Lori&#39;s parents, roommates and psychiatrists. This manner of dramatization and the fine performances provide three hours of sensitive and satisfying listening. A.A.B.

We're wired to avoid pain and pursue pleasure and security. It feels right to sell when everyone around us is scared and buy when everyone feels great. It may feel right-but it's not rational." <br>-From The Behavior Gap </b><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>Why do we lose money? It's easy to blame the economy or the financial markets-but the real trouble lies in the decisions we make.</p><p>As a financial planner, Carl Richards grew frustrated watching people he cared about make the same mistakes over and over. They were letting emotion get in the way of smart financial decisions. He named this phenomenon-the distance between what we should do and what we actually do-"the behavior gap." Using simple drawings to explain the gap, he found that once people understood it, they started doing much better.</p><p>Richards's way with words and images has attracted a loyal following to his blog posts for <i>The New York Times</i>, appearances on National Public Radio, and his columns and lectures.

As Richards writes: "We've all made mistakes, but now it's time to give yourself permission to review those mistakes, identify your personal behavior gaps, and make a plan to avoid them in the future. The goal isn't to make the 'perfect' decision about money every time, but to do the best we can and move forward.

But as a husband and father, he was distant, absent, and a failure. He'd let baseball take over his life, and as a result his family suffered. That is, until one day his daughter called with harrowing news.</p><p>"Dad, I have a brain tumor, and I'm sorry." These words from his seventeen-year-old daughter, Amy, turned his world upside-down. Now, more than ever, he was determined to put his family first.</p><p>The time they spent together in the months before her death will be treasured and remembered forever, but especially the inside joke that became a catchphrase for the Donnelly family as well as the Pittsburgh Pirates team that played in the National League Championship Series that year: "The chicken runs at midnight."</p><p>This book shares the heartwarming story behind the odd catchphrase - and how it still lives on as a symbol for never giving up&#x2014;and proves that God can work in the life of any person, even through their mistakes and failures.</p><p>Weaving baseball history with personal memoir, this book is one that will make you thrill to victory, believe in hope, stand up to cheer for what is good in peoples' lives. It's a powerful story of redemption and faith that reminds us that God can work in our lives even when we think it's too late to change - and sometimes He sends us signs from heaven if we only have eyes to see.</p></p><p><p>Tom Friend is a feature writer, columnist, director and commentator who has worked for ESPN, the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Washington Post</em>, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, the <em>Kansas City Star</em>, the <em>San Jose Mercury News </em>and the <em>National Sports Daily</em>.

Scraping away hundreds of years of ignorance, prejudice, and mythology, award-winnnig authors Patricia and Fredrick McKissack reveal the glory of these forgotten empires while inviting us to share in the inspiring process of historical recovery that is taking place today.</p></p><p><b>Patricia and Fredrick McKissack </b>were writers of children's fiction and nonfiction with a particular interest in the African American experience. Patricia received a Coretta Scott King&#x2013;Virginia Hamilton Award for Lifetime Achievement, as well as three individual Coretta Scott King Awards for books co-written with Frederick: <i>A Long Hard Journey: The Story of the Pullman Porter</i>, <i>The Dark-Thirty: Southern Tales of the Supernatural</i>, and <i>Christmas in the Big House, Christmas in the Quarters</i>.Grade 5-7-The McKissacks describe the West African civilizations that flourished between the years 700 C.E. to 1700 C.E. A chronological account is given of each successive kingdom, and there is also substantial information about the social history of Mali and Songhay, e.g., education, the treatment of women, religion, and arts and crafts. The relationship between Islam and politics, and the interplay between traditional and Islamic customs in Mali and Songhay are highlighted. The authors have attempted something unique with their inclusion of indigenous and contemporaneous historical accounts (by such historians as Leo Africanus and Ibn Battuta), as well as in their substantial use of oral history. While this makes for an interesting perspective, it prevents the line between history and mythology from being clearly drawn. For example, in the story of Sundiata, visits from a powerful king in the magical form of an owl are not distinguished from the factual dates that Sundiata ruled Mali. This might limit the usefulness of the book to situations in which adults are able to help students think critically about the text. Adequate but uninspired photographs of ancient artifacts and modern people with traditional life styles illustrate the text. Unfortunately, the maps do not make clear the geographical relationships among the three kingdoms (they existed at different times, and in each case the territory of the earlier kingdom was wholly or partly subsumed under the later kingdom). The helpful notes discuss the validity of certain bibliographical sources. The informative time line links events in Africa to those in other parts of the world, and the bibliography is impressive. In spite of its limitations, this title will be an important addition to most collections.<br><i>Susan Giffard, Midtown Ethical Culture School, New York City</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Kintsugi Wellness: The Japanese Art of Nourishing Mind, Body, and Spirit</h2><p><p><strong>"Candice has created a guide to an ancient, common-sense and approachable way of living.

Ellen Levine has revealed worldsof fascinating adventure with her nonfiction books for young readers.<br><br>Although Ellen Levine enjoys reading and writing fiction, most of her books for young readershave been nonfiction. "Writing nonfiction lets me in behind the scenes of the story. I enjoylearning new things and meeting new people, even if they lived 200 years ago."<br><br>"Real heroes," Levine says, "aren't necessarily on TV or in the news. They can be ordinarypeople who are willing to take risks for causes they believe in. Nonfiction offers a way tointroduce young readers to real people who have shown tremendous courage, even when facedwith great danger. All of us have the potential. And one doesn't have to be a grown-up," sheadds.<br><br>When she's not writing, Levine likes to share the excitement of research and the importance ofaccuracy with young readers. "Many young people think research is dull; you go to anencyclopedia, copy information, give it a title, and call it a report." Using her books asexamples, Ellen explains how to get other, more interesting information. "I may not mention theexact words, but I talk to young people about primary and secondary sources. If I'm speakingwith third graders, I ask them, 'Where would I go if I wanted to find out what it's like to be athird grader?' Most will say, 'Read a book.' But when they say, 'Ask a third grader,' I knowthey've understood what I mean by a primary source of inspiration."<br><br>For If You Were an Animal Doctor, for example, Ellen witnessed an emergency operation on acow. While doing research in Wyoming for Ready, Aim, Fire!, her biography of Annie Oakley,she got to hold the gun Ms. Oakley is believed to have shot in the presence of the Queen ofEngland. "It gave me such a strong feeling about this person," she says. "That's part of research,too."<br><br>Ellen Levine is the author of many acclaimed books, both fiction and nonfiction. Among them:If You Traveled West in a Covered Wagon, If Your Name Was Changed at Ellis Island, I Hate English!, If You Lived at the Time of Martin Luther King, and Secret Missions. Her recent book, Freedom's Children: Young Civil Rights Activists Tell Their Own Stories, was named one of the Ten Best Children's Books of the Year by The New York Times, and Best Book for Young Adults by the American Library Association.<br><br>Ellen divides her time between New York City and Salem, New York.Arranged in Q&amp;A style, this survey of earlier immigrations asks: ``Did all immigrants come through Ellis Island?'' (no); ``Did you have to have a job waiting for you?'' (again, no; in fact, it was not allowed). It's evident that America has always been a polyglot magnet--even in 1643, 18 languages were spoken in one colonial area. It's also evident that there's been long-standing prejudice against certain immigrants (ability to read was required for entrance, and first and second class arrivals didn't have to sweat it out at Ellis Island). Perhaps most interesting here are the individual stories: the name change in the author's own family; the child who had never seen a banana and ate it whole; the ``six- second'' medical exam. Levine (If You Traveled West in a Covered Wagon, 1986) gives multiculturalism an extra boost by ending with a sampling of words and other contributions from many heritages. Nostalgically warm impressionistic paintings, suffused with sepia, simultaneously signal suffering and hope. (Nonfiction. 7-10) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But this isn't most fairy tales...</b><br><br>Princess Violet is plain, reckless, and quite possibly too clever for her own good. Particularly when it comes to telling stories. One day she and her best friend, Demetrius, stumble upon a hidden room and find a peculiar book. A <i>forbidden</i> book. It tells a story of an evil being, called the Nybbas, imprisoned in their world. The story cannot be true--<i>not really</i>. But then the whispers start. Violet and Demetrius, along with an ancient, scarred dragon-the last dragon in existence, in fact-may hold the key to the Nybbas's triumph or its demise. It all depends on how they tell the story. After all, stories make their own rules.<br><br>Iron Hearted Violet is a story about the power of stories, our belief in them, and how one enchanted tale changed the course of an entire kingdom.<br><b><br></b><b>A 2012 Andre Norton Award Finalist</b><b>A Parents' Choice Gold Award Winner</b><br></p><p>Kelly Barnhill is a poet and a writer. <i>The Mostly True Story of Jack</i>, her debut novel, received four starred reviews. Kelly lives in Minnesota with her husband and three children.Gr 5-9-With her pug nose, mismatched eyes, and untamable hair, Princess Violet is not beautiful, but she is much beloved by her doting parents, friend Demetrius, and the Andulan people. Intelligent, imaginative, and often reckless, she is "a girl of her own ideas," mesmerizing audiences with her storytelling and shirking her studies to explore the castle. When she and Demetrius happen upon a mysterious book in a hidden-away room, they begin to unearth a forbidden tale about the Nybbas, an evil god that tried to take over all the worlds in the multiverse eons ago and was defeated and imprisoned by the other 12 gods. Fascinated, Violet yearns to know more. When tragedy strikes and she is left feeling isolated, she turns to the Nybbas, embracing its insidiously whispered promises of beauty and inadvertently unleashing its power. It will take much self-realization, sacrifice, and stoutheartedness to set things right. Fortunately, Violet is helped by steadfast Demetrius and an ancient dragon-the last of its kind. Filled with themes about the power of story, the book is appropriately narrated by Cassian, the cowardly court storyteller. The action unfolds at a leisurely pace, with complex subplots and mysteries gradually revealed. Violet's realm is richly imagined; mirror-related imagery is effectively employed throughout, encouraging readers to reflect upon the importance of exterior appearances and the many ways that truth can be refracted. Black-and-white sketches depict dramatic moments. This satisfying fantasy combines adventure with food for thought.-Joy Fleishhacker, School Library Journal&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Big snowflakes fluttered slowly through the air like white feathers </i><br><i>and made all of Heavenly Valley smooth and white and quiet and beautiful.</i><br><br>So begins the story of two orphaned sisters at Mrs. Monday&#x2019;s Boarding School. But nothing is heavenly for Nancy and Pamela (aka Plum): their parents died in a tragic accident years ago, they&#x2019;re constantly punished by the cruel Mrs. Monday, and they&#x2019;re all alone for the holidays.<br><br>Luckily, Nancy and Plum have each other, and though their prospects may be bleak, they&#x2019;re determined to change their lot for the better. If their plan works, the spirited sisters will never spend Christmas at the cold, dark boarding school again. But what will they find on the other side of Mrs. Monday&#x2019;s gate?<br><br>Adventure, warmth, unforgettable characters, and unexpected kindness abound in this classic story by Betty MacDonald, which was originally published in 1952. With illustrations by the acclaimed Mary GrandPr� and an introduction by Jeanne Birdsall, National Book Award&#x2013;winning author of <i>The Penderwicks,</i> this edition introduces the spunky, beloved heroines to a new generation of fans.</p><p>Betty MacDonald was born Anne Elizabeth Campbell Bard in Boulder, Colorado, in 1908. The daughter of a mining engineer, she spent her early years in some of the mining towns of Idaho, Montana, and Mexico. When she was nine, her father took the family&#x2014;his wife and five children&#x2014;to Seattle, where Betty lived until shortly after her marriage. <br><br>Among her books for children are <i>Nancy and Plum,</i> originally published in 1952, and the beloved classics <i>Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle,</i> <i>Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle&#x2019;s Magic,</i> <i>Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle&#x2019;s Farm,</i> and <i>Hello, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Mary GrandPr� is perhaps best known for creating the jackets and illustrations for the Harry Potter books.

You can read more about Mary GrandPr� and her work at www.marygrandpre.com.Mrs. Monday's Boarding Home&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>It was Christmas Eve. Big snowflakes fluttered slowly through the air like white feathers and made all of Heavenly Valley smooth and white and quiet and beautiful. Tall fir trees stood up to their knees in the snow and their outstretched hands were heaped with it. Trees that were bare of leaves wore soft white fur on their scrawny, reaching arms and all the stumps and low bushes had been turned into fat white cupcakes. Mrs. Monday's big, brick Boarding Home for Children wore drifts on its window sills, thick frosting on its steep slate roofs, big white tam o'shanters on its cold chimneys and by the light of the lanterns on either side of the big iron gates you could see that each of the gateposts wore a round snow hat. Even the sharp spikes of the high iron fencehad been blunted by the snow. &nbsp; However, in spite of its snowy decorations, in spite of the beauty of its setting, and even in spite of its being Christmas Eve, Mrs. Monday's was a forbidding-looking establishment. The fences were high and strong, the house was like a brick fortress and the windows, with the exception of one small one high up and almost hidden by the bare branches of a large maple tree, were like dark staring eyes. No holly wreath graced the heavy front door, no Christmas-tree lights twinkled through the windows and beckoned in the passer-by, no fragrant boughs nor pine cones were heaped on the mantel of the large cold fireplace, for Mrs. Monday, her niece Marybelle Whistle and all but two of her eighteen boarders had gone to the city to spend Christmas. Nancy and Plum Remson (Plum's real name was Pamela but she had named herself Plum when she was too little to say Pamela), the two boarders who remained, were left behind because they had no mother and father. No other place to go on Christmas Eve.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>You see, six years before, when Nancy and Plum were four and two years old, their mother and father had been killed in a train wreck and the children turned over to their only living relative, one Uncle John, an old bachelor who lived in a club in the city, didn't know anything about children, didn't want to know anything about children and did not like children. When the telegram from the Remsons' lawyer came notifying Uncle John of the tragic accident and the fact that he had just inherited two little girls, he was frantic.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Dreadful!" he said, fanning himself with his newspaper. "Gallivanting around the country getting killed. Dreadful and careless! Two little children! Heavens! What will I do with them? I'll have to move from this nice leather chair in this nice comfortable club and will probably wind up washing dishes and making doll clothes. Dreadful! Heavens!" Beads of sweat sprang out on his forehead like dew and he fanned himself some more. It was while he was folding his newspaper to make a bigger and better fan that he noticed the advertisement. It read:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>CHILDREN BOARDED--Beautiful country home with spacious grounds, murmuring brooks, own cows, chickens, pigs, and horses. Large orchard. Delicious home-cooked food. A mother's tender loving care. Year round boarders welcome. Rates upon request. Address Mrs. Marybelle Monday, Box 23, Heavenly Valley.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>With trembling hands, Uncle John tore out the advertisement and wrote a letter to Mrs. Monday. He received an immediate answer and three days later he was on his way to inspect this delightful boarding home so chock-full of good food and tender loving care for little children.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>It was springtime in Heavenly Valley and the fields were golden with dandelions, the slopes were foaming with cherry blossoms, the sky was lazily rolling big white clouds around and meadow larks trilled in the thickets. Uncle John was entranced. "Had forgotten the country was so beautiful!" he said to his chauffeur. "Certainly the place for children. Beautiful, beautiful!"&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>When they drew up to the imposing entrance of Mrs. Monday's Boarding Home for Children, Uncle John was most impressed. "Nice, solid, respectable place," he said, noting the very large, sturdily built brick house surrounded by the high spiked iron fence."Well built," he said to his chauffeur, who had jumped out to open the heavy iron gates for him.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"It certainly is," the chauffeur said, wondering to himself why a boarding home for little children should have such a wicked-looking fence. Surely not just to keep the rolling lawns from oozing out into the road!</p><h2>Prayer: How Praying Together Shapes the Church (Building Healthy Churches)</h2><p><p><strong>What is the role of corporate prayer in the church?</strong></p><p>Prayer is as necessary to the Christian as breathing is to the human body&#x2015;but it often doesn&#x2019;t come quite as naturally. In fact, prayer in the church often gets subtly pushed to the side in favor of pragmatic practices that promise tangible results.</p><p>This book focuses on the necessity of regular prayer as a central practice in the local church&#x2015;awakening us to the need and blessing of corporate prayer by examining what Jesus taught about prayer, how the first Christians approached prayer, and how to prioritize prayer in our congregations.</p></p><p><p><strong>John Onwuchekwa</strong>&nbsp;(MA, Dallas Theological Seminary) serves as pastor of Cornerstone Church in Atlanta, Georgia.</p><p>Pastor, Cornerstone Church, Atlanta, Georgia; author, <em>Prayer: How Praying Together Shapes the Church</em></p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if I&#x2019;ve ever read a book on prayer that left me feeling the entire range of human emotion&#x2015;until reading John Onwuchekwa&#x2019;s <i>Prayer</i>. Here is a human book&#x2015;beautiful, poignant, funny, gritty, and pastoral. This book is better than a correction to our often languid prayer lives. There&#x2019;s no guilt-based manipulation. Onwuchekwa writes like a fellow traveler, and as a fellow traveler knows what travelers need most: refreshment. Here&#x2019;s a thirst-quenching encouragement to join together in seeking our great God. I pray every church reads <i>Prayer</i> together; it will change our congregations. Here&#x2019;s a warm invitation to the entire church, beckoning the people of God to the wonders of prayer.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Thabiti Anyabwile,</strong> Pastor, Anacostia River Church, Washington, DC; author, <em>What Is a Healthy Church Member?</em></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Prayer</i> is an excellent book by my dear friend John Onwuchekwa. It is biblically and theologically rich. It is also real and honest. Want to get a corporate prayer meeting started in your church? This book is a very good start.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Daniel L. Akin,</strong> President, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;Everyone remembers that auntie or uncle who hushed our fears with the words, &#x2018;Baby, we just gon&#x2019; pray on that.&#x2019; John Onwuchekwa is that voice for today, calling the church back to one of the simplest and most powerful tools in her arsenal&#x2015;the habit of communal prayer. He doesn&#x2019;t merely want to reawaken our atrophied prayer muscles; he invites us into the much harder work of reorienting our priorities so that they&#x2019;re more in line with God&#x2019;s. Onwuchekwa&#x2019;s call to return to such &#x2018;first things&#x2019; is an excellent start to seeing Christian communities moving in the same kingdom direction.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>K. A. Ellis,</strong> Cannada Fellow for World Christianity, Reformed Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s likely something missing in your church, something you haven&#x2019;t thought much of and likely haven&#x2019;t even noticed. It&#x2019;s prayer. Onwuchekwa shares compelling, insightful, and biblical reasons why corporate prayer should be a priority for the church. What a privilege it is to pray together as a family&#x2015;this is the vision Onwuchekwa casts for us. This book has the potential to transform not only individuals, but also relationships and the culture in our churches. I highly recommend it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Trillia Newbell,</strong> author, <em>Sacred Endurance</em>; <em>If God Is for Us</em>; and <em>God&#x2019;s Very Good Idea</em></p><p>&#x201c;The early church moved forward in power because they were a praying church (Acts 4:31). If we today are so proficient at ministry mechanics that we can succeed without power from on high, we have failed. But if our churches today will heed this compelling call to prayer by John Onwuchekwa, we too will prevail against all earthly powers, for God&#x2019;s glory!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Ray Ortlund,</strong>&nbsp;Pastor to Pastors, Immanuel Church, Nashville, Tennessee</p><p>&#x201c;This is a thought-provoking book about the life of prayer in the local church. Onwuchekwa builds a theological framework and then gives tangible and practical solutions for fleshing it out. I&#x2019;ve had the privilege of working with John over the last decade, and I&#x2019;ve seen no one better able to take lofty concepts and present them in a way that is palatable for the body of Christ. This book is an outworking of his gift. He takes biblical principles and communicates them in an effective way. His work on this subject is a gift to the church.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Dhati Lewis,</strong> Lead Pastor, Blueprint Church, Atlanta, Georgia; Executive Director of Community Restoration, North American Mission Board; author, <em>Among Wolves: Disciple-Making in the City</em></p><p>&#x201c;What more could be needed by our churches than a revival of gospel-centered spirituality? And what more could we do to experience this revival than to recommit to nourishing communion with our Father through prayer? This is why I&#x2019;m thankful for this exceptional book by John Onwuchekwa. It is an accessible, practical, and relatable guide to the depths of the enormous, glorious privilege of speaking to the God of the universe.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Jared C. Wilson,</strong> Director of Content Strategy, Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary; Director, Pastoral Training Center, Liberty Baptist Church, Kansas City, Missouri; author, <em>Supernatural Power for Everyday People</em></p><p>&#x201c;I have a lot to say about this little book, because it&#x2019;s so good. In fact, I think this is one of the best books in this series. Brief and well written, this book by pastor John Onwuchekwa looks especially at two sections of the Gospels&#x2015;the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer, and Jesus&#x2019;s prayer in the garden of Gethsemane. Onwuchekwa shares significant observations that seem intuitive, but are also surprising. It is well illustrated, biblically faithful, and theologically accurate. This book is useful to think not only about when we should pray, but also about how we should pray, and even what we should pray about. It reintroduces us to the ignored topic of praying together at church. Hope-giving and inspiring, specific and practical, the whole book is sweetened by touches of humor. You and others could benefit from investing your time in reading this small book on such a grand topic.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Mark Dever,</strong>&nbsp;Senior Pastor, Capitol Hill Baptist Church, Washington, DC; President, 9Marks</p></p><h2>Killing Sin Habits: Conquering Sin with Radical Faith</h2><p>Scripture teaches that Christians are to actively subdue or mortify sin habits.

Vaccines have been described as the most incredible medical invention of all time&#x2014;a miracle of science and technology that has saved the lives of untold millions. I couldn&#x2019;t believe that seemingly intelligent, educated parents were purposefully foregoing vaccines for their children, and in fact, were so convinced these medical prodecures were harming us, they would go out of their way to try to convince others.When a close friend of mine told me that his infant child was going to be unvaccinated, I thought he was completely insane. After much coaxing, he convinced me to do my own research and challenge him on his beliefs. A few months later, I had read things about vaccines and disease that I had never heard before. Things that no one&#x2014;including our pediatrician&#x2014;had ever mentioned. I was convinced there was a giant conspiracy to try and discredit vaccines, but after diving headfirst into recent scientific research seldom mentioned in the news, I eventually came to believe much differently about vaccines and the diseases they are supposed to protect us from.This short book will take you along the same journey I made as I transitioned from a dedicated vaccinating parent to someone who now questions whether any vaccines are actually worth the risk, even in third world countries. It barely scratches the surface of this, the greatest debate of our time, but if nothing else, will give you a clear idea as to why an increasing number of parents are rasing their children unvaccinated.</p><p>Forrest Maready was born in Wilmington, N.C and grew up around a large film studio and the many movies and TV shows that filmed there.

Reordered to fit an atoms first approach, this title introduces atomic and molecular structure much earlier than the traditional approach, delaying the introduction of more abstract material so students have time to acclimate to the study of chemistry.

A walking bass line is the most common approach to jazz bass playing, but it is also used in rock music, blues, rockabilly, R&amp;B, gospel, Latin, country and many other types of music. The term 'walking' is used to describe the moving feeling that quarter notes create in the bass part. The specific goal of this book is to familiarize players with the techniques used to build walking bass lines and to make them aware of how the process works. Through the use of 90-minutes' worth of recorded rhythm tracks available online using the unique code in the book, players will have the opportunity to put the new learning directly into action. This book literally gives bassists the tools they need to build their own walking bass lines.</p><p>A performing bassist and former columnist for Bass Player magazine Ed Friedland has written numerous instructional books, including Building Walking Bass Lines.

The music was too loud, the liquor was bottom-shelf, and the crowd was too young and rowdy to do anything but give him a headache. It was the last kind of place you&#x2019;d find a man like him. The last kind of place he wanted to be. Tonight, it suited his needs to a T. The place was dark and anonymous&#x2014;and no one would remember him.</p> <p>He&#x2019;d received four notes so far, each becoming progressively more disturbing. He discovered the first in his mailbox last week. <i>I know what you did.</i> The second was taped to the windshield of his Lexus. <i>I know what all of you did.</i> He found the third note lying on the threshold inside the storm door off the kitchen. <i>Meet me or I go to the police.</i> Each note was written in blue ink on a sheet of lined notebook paper that had been torn in half. He&#x2019;d found the fourth note earlier this evening, taped to the front door. <i>Hochstetler farm. 1 a.m. Come alone.</i></p> <p>At first he&#x2019;d tried to convince himself he didn&#x2019;t understand the meaning of the messages. There were a lot of crazies out there. He was a successful man, after all. He had a nice home. Lived a comfortable lifestyle. Drove an expensive car. In the eyes of a few, that made him fair game. A target because someone else wanted what he had, and they were willing to do whatever it took to get it.</p> <p>He&#x2019;d crumpled the notes and tossed them in the trash. He&#x2019;d done his best to forget about them. But he knew the problem wasn&#x2019;t going to go away.</p> <p><i>I know what all of you did.</i></p> <p>Someone knew things they shouldn&#x2019;t. About him. About the others. About that night. They knew things no one could possibly know.</p> <p><i>Unless they&#x2019;d been there,</i> a little voice added.</p> <p>He&#x2019;d racked his brain, trying to figure out who. There was only one explanation: Someone was going to blackmail him. But who?</p> <p>Then two nights ago, he saw her, walking alongside the road near his house. But when he&#x2019;d stopped for a better look, she was gone, leaving him to wonder if he&#x2019;d seen anything at all. Or maybe it was his conscience playing tricks on him.</p> <p>It had been years since he spoke to the others. But after receiving the third note, he&#x2019;d done his due diligence and made the calls. None of them admitted to having received any sort of suspicious correspondence, but promised to let him know if that changed. If any of them knew more than they were letting on, they didn&#x2019;t let it show.</p> <p>After finding the latest note, he&#x2019;d gone about his business as usual the rest of the evening. He&#x2019;d ordered Chinese takeout and watched a movie. Afterwards, he&#x2019;d broken the seal on the bottle of Macallan Scotch whisky his daughter gave him for Christmas two years ago. At eleven thirty, restless and edgy, he&#x2019;d opened the gun cabinet, loaded the Walther .380 and dropped it into the inside pocket of his jacket. Grabbing the keys to his Lexus, he drove to the only place he knew of that was still open: the Brass Rail Saloon.</p> <p>Now, sitting at a back booth with chain saw rock echoing in his ears and two shots of watered-down Scotch burning a hole in his gut, he stared at the clock on the wall and waited.</p> <p><i>I know what all of you did.</i></p> <p>Watching two young girls who didn&#x2019;t look old enough to drink head toward the dance floor, he tugged his iPhone from his pocket and scrolled down to the number he wanted. It was too late to call, especially a man who was little more than a stranger to him these days, so he drafted a text instead.</p> <p><i>Meet is on. Will call 2 let you know outcome.</i></p> <p>He sat there for a moment before pressing Send, staring at the phone, assuring himself there was no way anyone could know what he&#x2019;d done. It had been thirty-five years. A lifetime. He&#x2019;d married, built a successful real estate firm, raised four children, and gone through a divorce. He was semi-retired now. A grandfather and respected member of the community. He&#x2019;d put that night behind him. Forgotten it had ever happened. Or tried to.</p> <p><i>Someone knows.</i></p> <p>A knife-stab of dread sank deep into his gut. Sighing, he dropped the phone back into his pocket and glanced up at the clock again. Almost 1 A.M. Time to go. Finishing his drink, he grabbed his keys off the table and then made for the door.</p> <p>Ten minutes later he was heading north on Old Germantown Road. Around him the rain was coming down so hard, he could barely see the dividing lines.</p> <p>&#x201c;Keep it between the beacons,&#x201d; he muttered, taking comfort in the sound of his own voice.</p> <p>All these years, he&#x2019;d believed the past no longer had a hold on him. Sometimes he almost convinced himself that night had never really happened. That it was a recurring nightmare and an overactive imagination run amok. But on nights like this, the truth had a way of sneaking up on you, like a garrote slipping over your head. And he knew&#x2014;he&#x2019;d always known&#x2014;somewhere inside the beating, cancerous mass that was his conscience, that some sins could never be forgiven. He owed penance for what he&#x2019;d done. And he&#x2019;d always known that someday fate or God&#x2014;or maybe Satan himself&#x2014;would see to it that he paid his debt.</p> <p>Gripping the steering wheel, he leaned forward so that his nose was just a few inches from the windshield. The rain drumming against the roof was as loud as a hail of bullets against tin siding. On the stereo Jim Morrison&#x2019;s haunting voice rose above the roar. There was something reassuring about music on nights like this. It was a sign of life and reminded him there were other people out there and made him feel less isolated and a little less alone. Tonight, he swore to God that was the same song that had been playing that night.</p> <p>Glancing away from the road, he reached down and punched the button for another station. When he looked up, she was there, on the road, scant yards from his bumper. He stomped the brake hard. The Lexus skidded sideways. The headlights played crazily against the curtain of rain, the black trunks of the trees. The car spun 180 degrees before jolting to a halt, facing the wrong direction.</p> <p>For the span of several heartbeats, he sat there, breathing heavily, gripping the wheel hard enough to make his knuckles ache. He&#x2019;d never believed in ghosts, but he knew there was no way in hell he could have seen what his eyes were telling him. Wanetta Hochstetler had been dead for thirty-five years. It had to be the booze playing tricks on him.</p> <p>Fearing a cop would happen by and find him sitting in his car in the dead of night with his hands shaking and the smell of rotgut whiskey on his breath, he turned the vehicle around. But he couldn&#x2019;t leave. Not without making sure. He squinted through the windshield, but his headlight beams revealed nothing on the road or shoulder. A quiver of uneasiness went through him when he spotted the old mailbox. The thing had been bashed in a dozen times over the decades&#x2014;by teenagers with beer bottles or baseball bats&#x2014;and even peppered with holes from shotgun pellets. But he could still make out the name: HOCHSTETLER.</p> <p>He didn&#x2019;t have a slicker or flashlight, but there was no avoiding getting out of the vehicle. He was aware of the pistol in his pocket, but it didn&#x2019;t comfort him, didn&#x2019;t make him feel any safer. Leaving the engine running, he turned up the collar of his jacket and swung open the door. Rain lashed his face as he stepped into the night. Water poured down his collar, the cold clenching the back of his neck like cadaver fingers.</p> <p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201d; he called out.</p> <p>He went around to the front of the vehicle and checked the bumper and hood. No dents. No blood. Just to be sure, he rounded the front end and ran his hands over the quarter panel on the passenger side, too. Not so much as a scratch. He hadn&#x2019;t hit anything, human or otherwise. Just his tired eyes playing tricks&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p>He was standing outside the passenger door when she stepped out of the darkness and fog. The sight of her paralyzed him with fear. With something worse than fear. The knowledge that he&#x2019;d been wrong. That time never forgot, no matter how badly you wanted it to&#x2014;and the reckoning had finally come.</p> <p>Her dress clung to a body that was still slender and strong and supple. The pouring rain and darkness obscured the details of her face. But she still had that rose-petal mouth and full lips. Long hair that had yet to go gray. He knew it was impossible for her to be standing there, unchanged, after all these years. After what happened to her. After what they <i>did</i> to her.</p> <p>&#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be you.&#x201d; The voice that squeezed from his throat was the sound of an old man on his deathbed, gagging on his own sputum, begging for a miracle that wasn&#x2019;t going to come.</p> <p>Her mouth pulled into a smile that turned his skin to ice. &#x201c;You look surprised to see me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re dead.&#x201d; He scraped unsteady fingers over his face, blinked water from his eyes. But when he opened them, she was still there, as alive and familiar as the woman who&#x2019;d been visiting his nightmares for thirty-five years. &#x201c;How&#x2014;?&#x201d;</p> <p>Never taking her eyes from his, she opened the driver&#x2019;s-side door, and killed the engine. Keys in hand, she went to the rear of the vehicle and pressed the trunk release. The latch clicked and the trunk sprang open.</p> <p>&#x201c;Get in,&#x201d; she said.</p> <p>When he didn&#x2019;t move she produced a revolver and leveled it at his chest. He thought of the Walther in his pocket, wondered if he could get to it before she shot him dead.</p> <p>He raised his hands. &#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d;</p> <p>Stepping closer, she jabbed the revolver at him so that the muzzle was just two feet from his forehead. Her arm was steady, her finger inside the guard, snug against the trigger. &#x201c;Do it.&#x201d;</p> <p>Shaking uncontrollably, he climbed into the trunk and looked up at her. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t mean it. <i>I swear we didn&#x2019;t mean it.</i>&#x201d;</p> <p>He didn&#x2019;t hear the shot.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Belinda Harrington stood on the porch of her father&#x2019;s house and knocked on the door hard enough to rattle the frame. &#x201c;Dad?&#x201d; She waited a minute and then used the heel of her hand and gave the wood a dozen hard whacks. &#x201c;<i>Dad?</i> You home?&#x201d;</p> <p>She&#x2019;d been trying to reach him for two days now, but he hadn&#x2019;t returned her calls. That wasn&#x2019;t unusual; the man was independent to a fault. He&#x2019;d been known to ignore calls when it suited him. Still, two days was a long time. Even for Dale Michaels.</p> <p>Wishing she&#x2019;d remembered to bring her umbrella, she scanned the driveway through the cascade of water coming off the roof. His Lexus was parked in its usual spot; he had to be here somewhere. She wondered if he&#x2019;d found himself a lady friend and they were holed up at her place or a hotel up in Wooster. Belinda wouldn&#x2019;t put it past him. Mom hadn&#x2019;t come right out and said it, but she let Belinda know in no uncertain terms that fidelity had never been one of Dale Michaels&#x2019;s strong points.</p> <p>Cupping her hands on either side of her mouth, she called for him. &#x201c;Dad!&#x201d;</p> <p>Her eyes wandered to the barn twenty yards away, and for the first time, she noticed the sliding door standing open a couple of feet. Though he&#x2019;d never been burglarized, her father was a stickler about security. He wouldn&#x2019;t leave the barn door open, especially if he wasn&#x2019;t home. The initial fingers of worry kneaded the back of her neck. Had he gone out to feed the chickens and fallen? Was he lying there, unable to get up and waiting for help? He wasn&#x2019;t accident prone, but she supposed something could&#x2019;ve happened. What if he&#x2019;d had a heart attack?</p> <p>Tenting her jacket over her head, she jogged across the gravel. The rain was really coming down, and by the time she reached the barn, her shoes and the hem of her pants were soaked. Shoving open the barn door another foot, Belinda stepped inside and shook rain from her jacket. The interior was dark and smelled of chicken poop and moldy hay. A few feet away, three bantam hens scratched and pecked at the floor. Stupid things. She wondered why her father kept them. Half the time, they didn&#x2019;t lay eggs and spent their days tearing up the petunias she&#x2019;d planted for him last spring. Pulling her jacket closed against the cold, she flipped the light switch, but the single bulb didn&#x2019;t help much.</p> <p>&#x201c;Dad? You out here?&#x201d;</p> <p>Belinda listened for a response, but it was difficult to hear anything above the incessant pound of rain against the tin shingles. There were a dozen or so places where water dripped down from the leaky roof to form puddles on the dirt floor. At least the chickens had plenty to drink.</p> <p>The barn was a massive structure with falling-down horse stalls and high rafters laced with cobwebs. As kids, she and her brother had played out here; they&#x2019;d even had a pony once. But neither she nor her brother had been interested in animals, and once her father had gotten his real estate company up and running, the place became a workshop where he tinkered with cars. The workbench with the Peg-Board back was still there, but the tools were covered with dust. A dozen or so boards were stacked haphazardly against the wall. The old rototiller stood in silhouette against the window where dingy light bled in. When her brother was twelve years old, he&#x2019;d nearly taken his foot off with that thing.</p> <p>The loose dirt from the floor stuck to her shoes as she crossed to the workbench. Belinda called out for him one final time and started for the door. She was midway there when something to her right, on the other side of a fat beam caught her attention. Cautiously, she moved closer and looked up, found herself staring at the leather soles of shoes and the hems of slacks. She stumbled back, her eyes taking in legs and then the torso of a man. One arm hanging down. Neck bent at an unnatural angle.</p> <p>A sound she didn&#x2019;t recognize tore from her throat. Somewhere in the back of her mind, she knew that thing hanging from the rafters was her father. That he was dead and she was sad his life had ended this way, and without so much as a good-bye. But the shock of seeing his lifeless body, so grotesque in death, overrode any impending sense of grief or loss.</p> <p>&#x201c;Dad! Oh my God! Dad! What did you do?&#x201d;</p> <p>Screaming, Belinda Harrington turned and sprinted through the door and into the pouring rain.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by Linda Castillo</p></p><h2>Travel as a Political Act (Rick Steves)</h2><p><b>Change the world one trip at a time.

For those who insist on cookbook checklists, there&#x2019;s an excellent chapter on &#x2018;primary practices,&#x2019; but I urge you to begin by truly contemplating the meaning of the opening sentence in the first chapter of Kent Beck&#x2019;s book: &#x2018;XP is about social change.&#x2019; You should do whatever it takes to ensure that every IT professional and every IT manager&#x2014;all the way up to the CIO&#x2014;has a copy of <i>Extreme Programming Explained</i> on his or her desk.&#x201d;<br> <br> &#x2014;<b>Ed Yourdon,</b> author and consultant </blockquote> <blockquote>&#x201c;XP is a powerful set of concepts for simplifying the process of software design, development, and testing. It is about minimalism and incrementalism, which are especially useful principles when tackling complex problems that require a balance of creativity and discipline.&#x201d;<br> <br> &#x2014;<b>Michael A. Cusumano,</b> Professor, MIT Sloan School of Management, and author of <i>The Business of Software</i> </blockquote> <blockquote>&#x201c;<i>Extreme Programming Explained</i> is the work of a talented and passionate craftsman. Kent Beck has brought together a compelling collection of ideas about programming and management that deserves your full attention. My only beef is that our profession has gotten to a point where such common-sense ideas are labeled &#x2018;extreme.&#x2019;...&#x201d;<br> <br> &#x2014;<b>Lou Mazzucchelli,</b> Fellow, Cutter Business Technology Council</blockquote> <blockquote>&#x201c;If your organization is ready for a change in the way it develops software, there&#x2019;s the slow incremental approach, fixing things one by one, or the fast track, jumping feet first into Extreme Programming. Do not be frightened by the name, it is not that extreme at all. It is mostly good old recipes and common sense, nicely integrated together, getting rid of all the fat that has accumulated over the years.&#x201d;<br> <br> &#x2014;<b>Philippe Kruchten,</b> UBC, Vancouver, British Columbia</blockquote> <blockquote>&#x201c;Sometimes revolutionaries get left behind as the movement they started takes on a life of its own. In this book, Kent Beck shows that he remains ahead of the curve, leading XP to its next level. Incorporating five years of feedback, this book takes a fresh look at what it takes to develop better software in less time and for less money. There are no silver bullets here, just a set of practical principles that, when used wisely, can lead to dramatic improvements in software development productivity.&#x201d;<br> <br> &#x2014;<b>Mary Poppendieck,</b> author of <i>Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit</i> </blockquote> <blockquote>&#x201c;Kent Beck has revised his classic book based on five more years of applying and teaching XP. He shows how the path to XP is both easy and hard: It can be started with fewer practices, and yet it challenges teams to go farther than ever.&#x201d;<br> <br> &#x2014;<b>William Wake,</b> independent consultant </blockquote> <blockquote>&#x201c;With new insights, wisdom from experience, and clearer explanations of the art of Extreme Programming, this edition of Beck&#x2019;s classic will help many realize the dream of outstanding software development.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;<b>Joshua Kerievsky,</b> author of <i>Refactoring to Patterns</i> and Founder, Industrial Logic, Inc.</blockquote> <blockquote>&#x201c;XP has changed the way our industry thinks about software development. Its brilliant simplicity, focused execution, and insistence on fact-based planning over speculation have set a new standard for software delivery.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;<b>David Trowbridge, </b>Architect, Microsoft Corporation</blockquote> <p>Accountability. Transparency. Responsibility. These are not words that are often applied to software development. </p> <p>In this completely revised introduction to Extreme Programming (XP), Kent Beck describes how to improve your software development by integrating these highly desirable concepts into your daily development process.</p> <p>The first edition of <i>Extreme Programming Explained</i> is a classic. It won awards for its then-radical ideas for improving small-team development, such as having developers write automated tests for their own code and having the whole team plan weekly. Much has changed in five years. This completely rewritten second edition expands the scope of XP to teams of any size by suggesting a program of continuous improvement based on:</p> <ul> <li>Five core values consistent with excellence in software development</li> <li>Eleven principles for putting those values into action</li> <li>Thirteen primary and eleven corollary practices to help you push development past its current business and technical limitations</li> </ul> <p>Whether you have a small team that is already closely aligned with your customers or a large team in a gigantic or multinational organization, you will find in these pages a wealth of ideas to challenge, inspire, and encourage you and your team members to substantially improve your software development. </p> <p>You will discover how to:</p> <ul> <li>Involve the whole team&#x2014;XP style</li> <li>Increase technical collaboration through pair programming and continuous integration</li> <li>Reduce defects through developer testing</li> <li>Align business and technical decisions through weekly and quarterly planning</li> <li>Improve teamwork by setting up an informative, shared workspace</li> </ul> <p>You will also find many other concrete ideas for improvement, all based on a philosophy that emphasizes simultaneously increasing the humanity and effectiveness of software development.</p> <p>Every team can improve. Every team can begin improving today. Improvement is possible&#x2014;beyond what we can currently imagine. <b> <i>Extreme Programming Explained, Second Edition,</i> </b> offers ideas to fuel your improvement for years to come.</p> <br> <br> <p></p></p><p><p> <b>Kent Beck</b> consistently challenges software engineering dogma, promoting ideas like patterns, test-driven development, and Extreme Programming. Currently affiliated with Three Rivers Institute and Agitar Software, he is the author of many Addison-Wesley titles.</p> <p> <b>Cynthia Andres</b> holds a B.S. in psychology with advanced work in organizational behavior, decision analysis, and women&#x2019;s studies. She has worked with Kent on the social aspects of Extreme Programming since its inception. She is also affiliated with Three Rivers Institute.</p> <br> <br> 0<p>The goal of Extreme Programming (XP) is outstanding software development. Software can be developed at lower cost, with fewer defects, with higher productivity, and with much higher return on investment. The same teams that are struggling today can achieve these results by careful attention to and refinement of how they work, by pushing ordinary development practices to the extreme.</p> <p>There are better ways and worse ways to develop software. Good teams are more alike than they are different. No matter how good or bad your team you can always improve. I intend this book as a resource for you as you try to improve.</p> <p>This book is my personal take on what it is that good software development teams have in common. I&#x2019;ve taken things I&#x2019;ve done that have worked well and things I&#x2019;ve seen done that worked well and distilled them to what I think is their purest, most &#x201c;extreme&#x201d; form. What I&#x2019;m most struck with in this process is the limitations of my own imagination in this effort. Practices that seemed impossibly extreme five years ago, when the first edition of this book was published, are now common. Five years from now the practices in this book will probably seem conservative.</p> <p>If I only talked about what good teams do I would be missing the point. There are legitimate differences between outstanding teams&#x2019; actions based on the context in which they work. Looking below the surface, where their activities become ripples in the river hinting at shapes below, there is an intellectual and intuitive substrate to software development excellence that I have also tried to distill and document.</p> <p>Critics of the first edition have complained that it tries to force them to program in a certain way. Aside from the absurdity of me being able to control anyone else&#x2019;s behavior, I&#x2019;m embarrassed to say that was my intention. Relinquishing the illusion of control of other people&#x2019;s behavior and acknowledging each individual&#x2019;s responsibility for his or her own choices, in this edition I have tried to rephrase my message in a positive, inclusive way. I present proven practices you can add to your bag of tricks.</p> <ul> <li>No matter the circumstance you can always improve.</li> <li>You can always start improving with yourself.</li> <li>You can always start improving today.</li> </ul></p><h2>Ghost Of (The Omnidawn Open)</h2><p>Ghost Of is a mourning song, not an exorcism or un-haunting of that which haunts, but attuned attention, unidirectional reaching across time, space, and distance to reach loved ones, ancestors, and strangers. By working with, in, and around the photographs that her brother left behind (from which he cut himself out before his death), Nguyen wrestles with what remains: memory, physical voids, and her family captured around an empty space.</p><p>Born in Los Angeles, DIANA KHOI NGUYEN is a poet and multimedia artist whose work has appeared widely in literary&nbsp;journals such as&nbsp;Poetry,&nbsp;American Poetry Review,&nbsp;Boston Review,&nbsp;PEN America, and&nbsp;The Iowa Review, among others.&nbsp;A winner of the 92Y's Discovery /&nbsp;Boston Review&nbsp;2017 Poetry Contest, she is a&nbsp;PhD candidate in creative writing at the University of Denver."Ghost of by Diana Khoi Nguyen wrestles with what remains in the wake of a death in the family.

In "An Empty House is a Debt," she explores this 'negative space' with remarkable precision: 'This craving carves a cave.' In "The Exodus," Nguyen traces trauma and its heirs from Saigon to Los Angeles: 'And if you bypassed a war, a war / wouldn't bypass you.' "--Briana Shemroske "Publishers Weekly" (1/1/2018 12:00:00 AM)<br><br>"This is a collection about leaving, about absence--a mother fleeing Vietnam, an infant, 'two minutes after [she] was born, ' already making her 'first evacuation, ' and, most of all, a brother leaving emptiness behind him in death.

In her previous book,<i> Anatomy of the Spirit,</i> Dr. Myss illuminated the hidden interactions of belief and body, soul and cell to show how, as she inimitably puts it, "your biography becomes your biology." In <i>Why People Don't Heal and How They Can</i>, she builds on her earlier teachings of the seven different energy centers of the body to provide a vital self-healing program for physical and spiritual disorders. With her characteristic no-nonsense style and high-voltage storytelling, she exposes and explodes the five myths about healing, explains the cultural and individual contexts in which people become physically and spiritually ill and invested in "woundology," and teaches new methods of working with the challenges that the seven energy centers embody.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>To help you get and stay on the path to wellness, Dr. Myss provides rituals and prayers for gaining a symbolic perspective on your life issues; for bolstering your personal power; and for connecting with a universal divine energy. Dr. Myss's breakthrough views on energy medicine and her active approach to healing life issues and physical illness will help you overcome the mental blocks that keep you from becoming well.</p><p>A woman tells you, within minutes of meeting her, that she&#39;s in a support group for incest victims. In theory, this woman is trying to recover from her childhood trauma, but in reality, Caroline Myss writes, she&#39;s one of a growing army of people who practice &#34;woundology,&#34; the use of their pain and suffering to manipulate those around them. Myss first noticed this phenomenon in the late 1980s, and began to analyze why so many people seemed to choose to carry such painful problems so proudly through life, to define themselves by the awful things that had happened to them. She offers a program to use &#34;symbolic power&#34;--a deep, spiritual insight that surpasses any conjured by the conscious mind--to craft a genuine conclusion to the illness or injury.Overcome the Hidden Barriers to Healing with America's Leading Medical Intuitive<p>On this stunning audio edition of the national PBS special with Dr. Caroline Myss, this acclaimed authority on the energetics of healing dares to take listeners to a hidden realm of the human body, beyond Western myths about healing - yielding a hope-giving program for health unlike any other. For over 15 years, Dr. Myss has worked face to face with the real experts on this controversial subject: thousands of people challenged by illnesses that failed to respond to conventional treatment. As a medical intuitive, Dr. Myss saw beyond their physical complaints -- and identified the greatest block to healing in our culture today. She shows that when we stop using illness as a way to gain power and intimacy with others, we stop wasting our sacred energy. It then becomes available, not only for self-healing, but for spiritual fulfillment. Here is a bold new vision of healing, presented by Dr. Myss in her own words, that will electrify you with its unlimited possibilities for improved health and spiritual connection. Includes an exclusive interview with Dr. Myss available nowhere else.</p></p><h2>A Survival Guide for New Special Educators</h2><p><b>What every special education teacher needs to know to survive and thrive</b> <p><i>A Survival Guide for New Special&nbsp;Educators</i>&nbsp;provides relevant, practical information for new special education teachers across a broad range of topic areas.

From housewarming to holiday celebration, from planting a garden to raising a family, gems of wisdom and inspirational selections celebrate all our most treasured moments at home.</p><p>A "home" is more than the structure we live in. A home is an intimate physical space that spiritually connects those who dwell within it. Blessing this space is a natural human inclination, as evidenced through the wealth of blessings and rituals spanning cultures and religious traditions. <p>My own home-based traditions and deep love of home and family compelled me to assemble this collection. The idea of a book to honor the simple pleasures of home was seeded by my good friend and gift-creating guru Jody Houghton. She suggested a volume devoted to this universal idea would be an appropriate addition to my collections of verse. She was right. </p><p>The idea was instantly fueled by thoughtful submissions from contributors who shared sentiments that were both personal and all embracing. The resulting treasure trove of wisdoms and insights, coupled with traditional sayings and blessings for the home and family, have blended into an enchanting collection that, like a happy home, is a delight to share. </p><p>So I invite you, dear readers, to bring this collection into your homes and hearts and be warmed by the blessings, meditations, prayers, and poems herein that celebrate and honor the sacred space we call home. -June Cotner</p>June Cotner is the best-selling author of more than a dozen anthologies of poems and blessings, including Graces and Wedding Blessings.

He chronicles the highs and lows of that fateful 1966&#x2013;67 season, his tough disciplinarian coach, the joys of winning, and the hard-won lessons of losing. Most of all, he recounts how a group of boys came together as a team, playing a sport that would become a metaphor for a man whose spirit could never be defeated.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for <i>My Losing Season</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;A superb accomplishment, maybe the finest book Pat Conroy has written.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post Book World</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A wonderfully rich memoir that you don&#x2019;t have to be a sports fan to love.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Houston Chronicle</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A memoir with all the Conroy trademarks . . .

It was part of my own definition of who I was and certainly the part I most respected. When I was a young man, I was well-built and agile and ready for the rough and tumble of games, and athletics provided the single outlet for a repressed and preternaturally shy boy to express himself in public....I lost myself in the beauty of sport and made my family proud while passing through the silent eye of the storm that was my childhood." <br>So begins Pat Conroy's journey back to 1967 and his startling realization "that this season had been seminal and easily the most consequential of my life." The place is the Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina, that now famous military college, and in memory Conroy gathers around him his team to relive their few triumphs and humiliating defeats. In a narrative that moves seamlessly between the action of the season and flashbacks into his childhood, we see the author's love of basketball and how crucial the role of athlete is to all these young men who are struggling to find their own identity and their place in the world. <br>In fast-paced exhilarating games, readers will laugh in delight and cry in disappointment. But as the story continues, we gradually see the self-professed "mediocre" athlete merge into the point guard whose spirit drives the team. He rallies them to play their best while closing off the shouts of "Don't shoot, Conroy" that come from the coach on the sidelines. For Coach Mel Thompson is to Conroy theundermining presence that his father had been throughout his childhood. And in these pages finally, heartbreakingly, we learn the truth about the Great Santini. <br>In "My Losing Season Pat Conroy has written an American classic about young men and the bonds they form, about losing and the lessons it imparts, about finding one's voice and one's self in the midst of defeat. And in his trademark language, we see the young Conroy walk from his life as an athlete to the writer the world knows him to be. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p>"A superb accomplishment, maybe the finest book Pat Conroy has written."<br>-<i>-The Washington Post Book World</i></p><h2>HILDEGARD OF BINGEN: A Saint for Our Times: Unleashing Her Power in the 21st Century</h2><p>In May, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI formally declared 12th century Benedictine nun Hildegard of Bingen a canonized saint, with the canonization ceremony scheduled for October.

One Patient at a Time</h2><p>A perfect blend of medical drama and spiritual insight, <i>Gray Matter</i> is a fascinating account of Dr. David Levy&#x2019;s decision to begin asking his patients if he could pray for them before surgery.

Killing the mother after she had served him so well seemed ungracious.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you want me to do with her body?&#x201d;</p><p>The Omega watched as his son reached out and grabbed hold of his thumb. The grip was strong. &#x201c;How odd.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>It was hard to put into words what he was feeling. Or perhaps that was the point. He hadn&#x2019;t expected to feel anything.</p><p>His son was supposed to be a defensive reaction to the the Destroyer Prophecy, a calculated response in the war against the vampires, a strategy to ensure the Omega survived. His son would do battle in a new way and kill off that race of savages before the Destroyer chipped away at the Omega&#x2019;s being until there was nothing left.</p><p>Up until this moment, the plan had been executed flawlessly, starting with the abduction of the female vampire the Omega had inseminated and ending here with this new arrival in the world.</p><p>The infant looked up at him, budding mouth working. He smelled sweet, but not because he was a <i>lesser.</i></p><p>The Omega didn&#x2019;t want to let him go, suddenly. This young in his arms was a miracle, a living, breathing loophole. The Omega had not been granted the act of creation as his sister had, but reproduction had not been denied him. He might not have been able to bring a whole new race into being. But he could bring a part of himself forward from the genetic pool.</p><p>And he had.</p><p>&#x201c;Master?&#x201d; the <i>Fore-lesser</i> said.</p><p>He really did not want to let the baby go, but to have this work, his son had to live with the enemy, be raised as one among them. His son had to know their language and their culture and their ways.</p><p>His son had to know where they lived so he could go and slaughter them.</p><p>The Omega forced himself to give the infant over to his <i>Fore-lesser.</i> &#x201c;Leave him at the gathering place I forbade you to sack. Swaddle him and leave him, and when you return here I shall draw you forth unto me.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Whereupon you shall die as I so will it</i>, the Omega finished to himself.</p><p>There could be no leaks. No mistakes.</p><p>As the <i>Fore-lesser</i> did some fawning, which would have interested the Omega at any other time, the sun came up over the cornfields of Caldwell, New York. From upstairs, a soft fizzling sound bloomed into a full-blown fire, the burning smell announcing the incineration of the female&#x2019;s body along with all the blood on that bed.</p><p>Which was just lovely. Tidiness mattered, and this farmhouse was brand-new, built especially for the son&#x2019;s birth.</p><p>&#x201c;Go,&#x201d; the Omega commanded. &#x201c;Go and carry out your duty.&#x201d;</p><p>The <i>Fore-lesser</i> left with the infant, and as the Omega watched the door shut, he yearned for his offspring. Positively ached for the boy.</p><p>The solution for his angst was at hand, however. The Omega willed himself into the air and catapulted what corporeal form he had to the &#x201c;present,&#x201d; to the very living room he was in.</p><p>The change in time registered in a rapid aging of the house around him. Wallpaper faded and peeled off in lazy strips. Furniture ratted and became worn in patterns consistent with over two decades of use. The ceiling dulled from bright white to dingy yellow, as if smokers had been exhaling for years. Floorboards curled up at the corners of the hallway.</p><p>In the back of the house, he heard two humans arguing.</p><p>The Omega drifted down to the filthy, wilted kitchen that merely seconds ago had been shiny as the day it had been built.</p><p>As he came into the room, the man and the woman stopped their fighting, freezing with shock. And he got on with the tedious business of emptying the farmhouse of prying eyes.</p><p>His son was returning unto the fold. And the Omega needed to see him almost more than he needed to put him to use.</p><p>As the evil touched the center of his chest, he felt empty and thought of his sister. She had brought forth into the world a new race, a race engineered through a combination of her will and the biology that was available. She&#x2019;d been so proud of herself.</p><p>Their father had, as well.</p><p>The Omega had started to kill the vampires just to spite them both, but had quickly learned he fed off deeds of evil. Their father couldn&#x2019;t stop him, of course, because, as it turned out, the Omega&#x2019;s deeds&#x2014;nay, his very existence&#x2014;were necessary to balance his sister&#x2019;s goodness.</p><p>Balance had to be maintained. It was his sister&#x2019;s core principle, the justification for the Omega, and their father&#x2019;s mandate from his father. The very basis of the world.</p><p>And so it was that the Scribe Virgin suffered and the Omega drew his satisfaction. With each death wrought on her race she hurt, and well he knew it. The brother had always been able to feel the sister.</p><p>Now, though, that was even truer.</p><p>As the Omega pictured his son out there in the world, he worried about the boy. Hoped that the twenty-plus years had been easy for him. But that was a proper parent, was it not. Parents were supposed to have concern over their offspring and nurture them and protect them. Whatever your core was, whether it be virtue or sin, you wanted the best for what you had brought forth into the world.</p><p>It was stunning to find that he had something in common with his sister, after all...a shock to know that they both wanted what children they begot to survive and thrive.</p><p>The Omega looked at the bodies of the humans he had just laid to waste.</p><p>Of course, that was a mutually exclusive proposition, wasn&#x2019;t it.</p><p><i>Chapter One</i></p><p>THE WIZARD HAD RETURNED.</p><p>Phury closed his eyes and let his head fall back against his headboard. Ah, hell, what was he saying. The wizard had never left.</p><p><i>Mate, sometimes you take the piss out of me</i>, the dark voice in his head drawled. <i>You truly do. After all we&#x2019;ve been together?</i></p><p>All they&#x2019;d been together...wasn&#x2019;t that the truth.</p><p>The wizard was the cause of Phury&#x2019;s driving need for red smoke, always in his head, always hammering about what he hadn&#x2019;t done, what he should have done, what he could have done better.</p><p>Shoulda. Woulda. Coulda.</p><p>Cute rhyme. The reality was that one of the Ring-wraiths from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> drove him to the red smoke sure as if the bastard hog-tied him and threw him in the back of a car.</p><p><i>Actually, mate, you&#x2019;d be the front bumper.</i></p><p>Exactly.</p><p>In his mind&#x2019;s eye, the wizard appeared in the form of a Ring-wraith standing in the midst of a vast gray wasteland of skulls and bones. In its proper British accent, the bastard made sure that Phury never forgot his failures, the pounding litany causing him to light up again and again just so he didn&#x2019;t go into his gun closet and eat the muzzle of a forty.</p><p><i>You didn&#x2019;t save him. You didn&#x2019;t save them. The curse was brought upon them all by you. The fault is yours...the fault is yours....</i></p><p>Phury reached for another blunt and lit it with his gold lighter.</p><p>He was what they called in the Old Country the <i>exhile dhoble.</i></p><p>The second twin. The evil twin.</p><p>Born three minutes after Zsadist, Phury&#x2019;s live birth had brought the curse of imbalance to the family. Two noble sons, both born breathing, was too much good fortune, and sure enough, balance had been wrought: Within months, his twin had been stolen from the family, sold into slavery, and abused for a century in every manner possible.</p><p>Thanks to his sick bitch mistress, Zsadist was scarred on his face and his back and his wrists and neck. Scarred worse on the inside.</p><p>Phury opened his eyes. Rescuing his twin&#x2019;s physical body hadn&#x2019;t gone far enough; it had taken the miracle of Bella to resurrect Z&#x2019;s soul, and now she was in danger. If they lost her...</p><p><i>Then all is proper and the balance remains intact for the next generation</i>, the wizard said. <i>You don&#x2019;t honestly think your twin will reap the blessing of a live birth? You shall have children beyond measure. He shall have none. That is the way of the balance.</i></p><p><i>Oh, and I&#x2019;m taking his</i> shellan, <i>too, did I mention that?</i></p><p>Phury picked up the remote and turned up <i>&#x201c;Che Gelida Manina.&#x201d;</i></p><p>Didn&#x2019;t work. The wizard liked Puccini. The Ring-wraith just started to waltz around the field of skeletons, its boots crushing what was underfoot, its heavy arms swaying with elegance, its black shredded robes like the mane of a stallion throwing its regal head. Against a vast horizon of soulless gray, the wizard waltzed and laughed.</p><p>So. Fucked. Up.</p><p>Without looking, Phury reached over to the bedside table for his bag of red smoke and his rolling papers. He didn&#x2019;t have to measure the distance. He was the rabbit who knew where its pellets were.</p><p>While the wizard whooped it up to <i>La Boh�me</i>, Phury rolled up two fatties so he could keep his chain going, and he smoked while he readied his reinforcements. As he exhaled, what left his lips smelled like coffee and chocolate, but to put a dull on the wizard, he would have used the stuff even if it had been like burning trash in the nose.</p><p>Hell, he was getting to the point where lighting up a whole fucking Dumpster would have been fine and dandy if it could get him some peace.</p><p><i>I can&#x2019;t believe you don&#x2019;t value our relationship more</i>, the wizard said.</p><p>Phury focused on the drawing in his lap, the one he&#x2019;d been working on for the last half hour. After he did a quick catch-up review, he dipped the tip of his quill into the sterling silver pot he had balanced against his hip. The pool of ink inside looked like the blood of his enemies, with its dense, oily sheen. On the paper, though, it was a deep reddish brown, not a vile black.</p><p>He would never use black to depict someone he loved. Bad luck.</p><p>Besides, the sanguinary ink was precisely the color of the highlights in Bella&#x2019;s mahogany hair. So it fit his subject.</p><p>Phury carefully shaded the sweep of her perfect nose, the fine lashes of the quill crisscrossing one another until the density was correct.</p><p>Ink drawing was a lot like life: One mistake and the whole thing was ruined.</p><p>Damn it. Bella&#x2019;s eye wasn&#x2019;t quite up to par.</p><p>Curling his forearm around so he didn&#x2019;t drag his wrist through the new ink he&#x2019;d laid, he tried to fix what was wrong, shaping the lower lid so the curve of it was more angled. His strokes marked up the sheet of Crane paper nicely enough. But the eye still wasn&#x2019;t working.</p><p>Yeah, not right, and he should know, considering how much time he&#x2019;d spent drawing her over the last eight months.</p><p>The wizard paused in mid-pli� and pointed out that this pen-and-ink routine was a shitty thing to do. Drawing your twin&#x2019;s pregnant <i>shellan.</i> Honestly.</p><p><i>Only a right sodding bastard would get fixated on a female who was taken by his twin. And yet you have. You must be so proud of yourself, mate.</i></p><p>Yeah, the wizard had always had a British accent for some reason.</p><p>Phury took another drag and tilted his head to the side to see if a change in viewing angle would help. Nope. Still not right. And neither was the hair, actually. For some reason he&#x2019;d drawn Bella&#x2019;s long, dark hair in a chignon, with wisps tickling her cheeks. She always wore it down.</p><p>Whatever. She was beyond lovely anyway, and the rest of her face was as he usually depicted her: Her loving stare was to the right, her lashes silhouetted, her gaze showing a combination of warmth and devotion.</p><p>Zsadist sat to her right at meals. So that his fighting hand was free.</p><p>Phury never drew her with her eyes looking out at him. Which made sense. In real life, he never drew her stare, either. She was in love with his twin, and he wouldn&#x2019;t have changed that, not for all his longing for her.</p><p>The scope of his drawing ran from the top of her chignon to the top of her shoulders. He never drew her pregnant belly. Pregnant females were never depicted from the breastbone down. Again, bad luck. As well as a reminder of what he feared most.</p><p>Deaths on the birthing bed were common.</p><p>Phury ran his fingertips down her face, avoiding that nose, where the ink was still drying. She was lovely, even with the eye that wasn&#x2019;t right, and the hair that was different, and the lips that were less full.</p><p>This was done. Time to start another.</p></p><h2>Me and My Little Brain (Great Brain, Book 3)</h2><p><b>This third book in the series is a great combination of&nbsp;<i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i>&nbsp;and The Terrible Two series, and is perfect for fans of Roald Dahl.</b><br><br>Tom a.k.a. the Great Brain, is off to boarding school.&nbsp; Now his little brother, J.D., is free to follow in Tom's ingenious, conniving, and profitable footsteps.&nbsp; All of J.D.'s attempts at turning a profit fail miserably, and he soon realizes that he just doesn't have that crafty Great Brain knack.&nbsp; But when his younger brother is kidnapped, J.D. finds that his little brain may not be so ordinary after all . . .</p><p>When that shrewd conniver, Tom, the infamous Great Brain, is sent to school in Salt Lake City, his favorite victim, J.D., figures he can step into his brother&#39;s shoes as town hustler. Nothing&#39;s wrong with his technique--it&#39;s just that he hasn&#39;t got the instincts of a real con man. But when outlaws kidnap J.D.&#39;s four-year-old adopted brother, Frankie, J.D.&#39;s talents find their proper inspiration. And if everybody thinks it looks like curtains for Frankie it&#39;s because they haven&#39;t counted on what a &#34;little brain&#34; combined with a big heart can do.John D. Fitzgerald was born in Utah and lived there until he left at eighteen to begin a series of interesting careers ranging from jazz drummer to foreign correspondent. His stories of The Great Brain were based on his own childhood in Utah with a conniving older brother named Tom. These reminiscenses led to eight memorable Great Brain books. John D.

He died in Florida, his home of many years, at the age of eighty-one.</p><h2>Essence of Prayer (Hiddenspring)</h2><p>Prayer is a word we take for granted. Ought we to do so? What do we mean by prayer? What does the word mean in the Christian context? Almost always when we talk about prayer we refer to something we do. From that standpoint, questions problems, confusion, discouragement and illusions multiply. For Ruth Burrows it is essential to correct this view. <p>Our Christian knowledge assures us that prayer is essentially what God does, how God addresses us, looks at us. And what God is doing for us is giving us the Divine Self in love. What then is the core of the central message of the revelation of Jesus? It is the unconditional love of God for us, for each one of us. God the unutterable, incomprehensible Mystery, the Reality of all reality, the Life of all Life. And this means that divine Love desires to communicate its Holy Self to us. This is the richness of the vision of a contemplative nun who contradicts the heresy of so much modern writing about the spiritual life--namely that we reach God by running faster. The growing fascination for the public of the contemplative and monastic life is evidence of the profound appeal of this approach. For this there is a real hunger. At its simplest we do no look for success so as to be assured that we do believe. We give ourselves over completely to divine love. Ultimately, we live for God and not for ourselves.</p></p><p>Ruth Burrows is a Carmelite nun in Britain.'Ruth Burrows, the experienced Carmelite writer: hard-headed, warm-hearted, helpful and positive about God's universal invitation to prayer.'~ <em>The Tablet, </em>22nd July 2006 (Christopher Howse <i>The American Spectator</i>)<br><br>'This is a book that should chance lives.

God has given her great gifts, and she has opened herself to receive them' (p. vii). In this lies her appeal. Teresa of Avila wrote from her own experience. Ruth Burrows, too, writes from her own experience, albeit different from Teresa's. So she too writes with authority&#x2014;and it shows!

Steven Tadelis begins with a concise description of rational decision making, and goes on to discuss strategic and extensive form games with complete information, Bayesian games, and extensive form games with imperfect information. He covers a host of topics, including multistage and repeated games, bargaining theory, auctions, rent-seeking games, mechanism design, signaling games, reputation building, and information transmission games. Unlike other books on game theory, this one begins with the idea of rationality and explores its implications for multiperson decision problems through concepts like dominated strategies and rationalizability. Only then does it present the subject of Nash equilibrium and its derivatives.</p><br><br><p> <i>Game Theory</i> is the ideal textbook for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students.

Aimed at intermediate to advanced undergraduates, it presents and discusses the theory remarkably clearly, at both the intuitive and formal levels. One novel feature I like is its serious consideration of the decision theoretic foundations of game theory. Another is its transparent presentation of relatively recent topics and applications, such as reputations in asymmetric information games, legislative bargaining, and cheap talk communication."<b>--Steve Matthews, University of Pennsylvania</b></p><p>"Steve Tadelis has written an up-to-date, comprehensive, yet reader-friendly introductory textbook to game theory. He explains difficult concepts in an exceptionally clear and simple way, making the book accessible to students with a minimal background in mathematics. The abundance of examples and illustrations, drawing from economics, political science, and business strategy, not only shows the wide range of applications of game theory, but also makes the book attractive and fun to read. Tadelis's book will undoubtedly become a reference textbook for a first course in game theory."<b>--Francis Bloch, �cole Polytechnique</b></p><p>"These days, game theory plays an essential role not only in economics, but in many other branches of social and engineering science, as well as philosophy, biology, psychology, even law. In all these disciplines, students and instructors alike should welcome this excellent resource for mastering the key tools of modern game theory."<b>--Peter Hammond, University of Warwick</b></p><p>"It's hard to write a game theory textbook that strikes a good balance between precision and accessibility.

Still an integral part of India's cultural and religious expression, the Ramayana was originally composed by the Sanskrit poet Valmiki around 300 b.c. The epic of Prince Rama's betrayal, exile, and struggle to rescue his faithful wife, Sita, from the clutches of a demon and to reclaim his throne has profoundly affected the literature, art, and culture of South and Southeast Asia-an influence most likely unparalleled in the history of world literature, except, possibly, for the Bible. Throughout the centuries, countless versions of the epic have been produced in numerous formats and languages. But previous English versions have been either too short to capture the magnitude of the original; too secular in presenting what is, in effect, scripture; or dry, line-by-line translations. Now novelist Ramesh Menon has rendered the tale in lyrical prose that conveys all the beauty and excitement of the original, while making this spiritual and literary classic accessible to a new generation of readers.</p></p><p><p><b>Ramesh Menon </b>is the author of <i>Blue God: A Life of Krishna</i> and <i>The Hunt for K</i>, a national bestseller in India.

He dug it out, while Gianni led him back to his usual table. Dino wasn&#x2019;t there yet.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stone?&#x201d; An unfamiliar female voice.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Holly Barker.&#x201d;</p><p>It took only a nanosecond for Stone to display her image on the inside of his eyelids&#x2014;tall, light brown hair, sun-streaked, well put together, badge. &#x201c;Hello, Chief, how are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Confused.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How can I help?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in a taxi, and I don&#x2019;t know where to tell the driver to take me. Can you recommend a good hotel, not too expensive?&#x201d; &#x201c;In what city?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In New York. I&#x2019;m headed for the Midtown Tunnel, I think.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you stay at my house? There&#x2019;s a guest room.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have a friend with me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Male or female?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Female.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My secretary is there right now, working late. I&#x2019;ll call and tell her to expect you.&#x201d; He gave her his Turtle Bay address. &#x201c;There are three guest rooms&#x2014;two with king beds and one with twins, all on the top floor. You choose.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure? I don&#x2019;t want to put you to any trouble.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No trouble at all. That&#x2019;s what the guest rooms are for.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When will I see you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have you had dinner?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Drop your luggage, freshen up, and meet me at Elaine&#x2019;s&#x2014;Second Avenue, between Eighty-eighth and Eighty-ninth.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds great. We&#x2019;re at the tunnel now. How long should it take me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re quick, half an hour, but you&#x2019;re a woman . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Half an hour it is, and don&#x2019;t ever put a &#x2018;but&#x2019; in front of that statement.&#x201d; She hung up.</p><p>Gianni put a Knob Creek on the rocks in front of him, and Stone took a sip. &#x201c;Better get him something, too,&#x201d; Stone said, pointing at Dino, his partner when he had been an NYPD detective. Dino spoke to a couple of people at the front tables, then came back and pulled up a chair. His drink had already arrived.</p><p>&#x201c;How you doing?&#x201d; Dino asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Not bad. You?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The same. You&#x2019;re looking thoughtful.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was just trying to remember everything about my trip to Vero Beach, Florida, last year, when I was picking up my Malibu at the Piper factory.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was in a bank in the next town, a place called Orchid Beach, getting a cashier&#x2019;s check to pay for the airplane, when a bunch of guys wearing masks walked in and stuck the place up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yeah, you told me about that. They shot a guy, didn&#x2019;t they?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. A lawyer with a funny name&#x2014;Oxblood, or something like that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oxenhandler.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How did you remember that?&#x201d;</p><p>Dino tapped his temple. &#x201c;I do <i>The New York Times</i> crossword every day. Calisthenics for the brain.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Funny, it doesn&#x2019;t seem to have muscled up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I remembered the name, didn&#x2019;t I? While your brain has apparently turned to mush. Why were you thinking about the bank robbery?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not the robbery so much, the woman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, now we&#x2019;re getting to the nub of things. I&#x2019;ll bite. What woman?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s the chief of police down there, name of Holly Barker. She was supposed to marry Oxenhandler that very day. I met her at the police station.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You went to the police station?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was a witness, and I didn&#x2019;t have a shirt.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re losing me here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I took off my shirt and held it to Oxenhandler&#x2019;s chest wound, not that it did much good. He died shortly after reaching the hospital.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you were bare-chested in Orchid Beach, and you met this girl?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Woman. We&#x2019;re not supposed to call them girls, remember?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A cop loaned me a shirt. Holly arrived and took over the case. I remember how cool she was under the circumstances.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pretty bad circumstances.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. After I came home I called her with some information, and we had a couple of phone conversations after that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So why are you thinking about this . . . person?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s in town. In fact, she&#x2019;s at my house right&#x2014;Jesus, I forgot to call Joan.&#x201d; Stone dialed his office number and got his secretary on the phone. &#x201c;There are a couple of women coming to the house&#x2014;one is named Holly Barker; I don&#x2019;t know the other one. Will you put them in whichever of the guest rooms they want, and give them a key?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re doing two at a time now, Stone?&#x201d; Joan Robertson asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I should be so lucky. Just get them settled. I&#x2019;ll explain later.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever you say, boss.&#x201d; She hung up.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s she doing up here?&#x201d; Dino asked.</p><p>&#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t say. She called from a taxi on the way in from the airport.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nice of you to offer her a bed,&#x201d; Dino said slyly.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, shut up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you offer the two of them your bed?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I offered them a guest room; that&#x2019;s it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So far. Well, I guess it&#x2019;s how you keep your weight down, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dino . . .&#x201d;</p><p>Gianni put some menus on the table.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be two more,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;And we&#x2019;ll order when the ladies arrive.&#x201d;</p><p>Gianni brought two more menus and a basket of hot bread. Stone tore into a slab of sourdough.</p><p>&#x201c;Carbing up for later?&#x201d; Dino asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Get off it. I just want to get something in my stomach with the bourbon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mary Ann and I worry about you, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mary Ann has enough to worry about with you on her hands.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We want to see you settled with some nice, plain girl.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You just want to drag everybody down with you,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;And what do you mean, &#x2018;plain&#x2019;?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A beautiful woman demands too much of a man.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re married to a beautiful woman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I speak from experience. Their care and feeding is a full-time job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mary Ann cares for and feeds both of you, and without the slightest help from you, as I recall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s an exceptional woman,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never do that well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks a lot.&#x201d;</p><p>They finished their drinks and had just ordered another round, when Dino nodded toward the front door. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet that&#x2019;s your lady cop,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Stone looked up to see a tall woman, more striking than he remembered, striding toward them, smiling.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, there,&#x201d; Holly said, offering her hand.</p><p>Stone and Dino were on their feet, getting her chair.</p><p>&#x201c;This is my friend Dino Bacchetti, my old partner. He runs the detective squad at the Nineteenth Precinct.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Dino.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Holly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your friend?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Daisy&#x2019;s exhausted,&#x201d; Holly replied. &#x201c;I put her to bed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can I get you a drink?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you drinking?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bourbon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That will do nicely,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>Gianni brought her the drink.</p><p>&#x201c;So what brings you to the big city?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in hot pursuit of a fugitive,&#x201d; Holly said.</p><p>Stone handed her a menu. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s order dinner, then you can tell me about it.&#x201d;</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>THEY WERE HALFWAY through their first course, a salad of French green beans, mushrooms, and bacon.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell us about your fugitive, Holly,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;Maybe I can help.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That would be nice, Dino,&#x201d; Holly replied. &#x201c;First, a little background: Not long ago, I wrapped up a case in my jurisdiction that involved a man named Ed Shine; his history is interesting. He came to the U.S. from Italy, as a teenager, and his original name was Gaetano Costello.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Costello?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Second cousin to Frank. The mob changed his name to Edward Shine, planted a birth certificate in the county records, and put him through high school and college, ostensibly the son of some people named Shine, who just happened to live in the same apartment building as Mr. and Mrs. Meyer Lansky. Right out of college, Ed starts building office buildings, and he never has any trouble arranging financing; he&#x2019;s laundering money for the mob. He continues doing this for forty years or so, and very successfully. In the meantime, he&#x2019;s visiting Florida on a regular basis, and he has a brief affair with a Latino woman and fathers a son out of wedlock, naming the boy Enrico. The kid takes his mother&#x2019;s maiden name, Rodriguez, and is called Trini.</p><p>&#x201c;Trini Rodriguez grows up his father&#x2019;s son and is trained in all the little arts required of a Mafia-made man. His favorite is killing people. I thought I had killed him, but he bounced back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why did you think you had killed him?&#x201d; Stone asked, putting down his fork.</p><p>&#x201c;Because I stuck a steak knife in his neck and wiggled it around, and he was pumping blood at a great rate the last time I saw him.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone gulped. &#x201c;And why, may I ask, did you stick a steak knife in his neck?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He was trying to kill an FBI agent at the time, and I was trying to stop him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Apparently, though, his people got him to a hospital in time, and he recovered.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t he arrested?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but there were complications.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He was trying to kill an FBI agent, but there were complications?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right. Turns out Trini had been an FBI informant all the time he was killing people, and the Miami agent in charge, a guy named Harry Crisp, took him out of the hospital and put him in the Witness Protection Program, saying that he needed his testimony in the big case&#x2014;<i>my</i> case. All this without mentioning it to me, and I wanted the guy for mass murder.&#x201d;</p><p>Dino spoke up. &#x201c;So the guy you&#x2019;ve come to New York to find is in the Federal Witness Protection Program?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Dino said, wiping his mouth and taking a sip of his wine, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s going to make it just a little difficult to arrest him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hang on,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;You said you wanted him for <i>mass murder</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right. I had a witness in protective custody, and he killed two of her relatives, trying to get at her. She insisted on going to the funeral, and the FBI had the scene covered with lots of agents and a few snipers. I&#x2019;m up in the church bell tower with one of the snipers when the hearses arrive, and everybody is on maximum alert, looking for somebody with a weapon.</p><p>&#x201c;The coffins are taken out of the hearses and set by the graveside, and my witness walks over, puts a rose on the first coffin and kisses it, then steps over to the other coffin, and, as she kisses it, both coffins explode.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Holy shit,&#x201d; Dino said quietly.</p><p>&#x201c;My sentiments exactly,&#x201d; Holly replied. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s carnage, everywhere you look. More than a dozen people are dead and several dozen injured, some critically. Like I said, I&#x2019;m in the church tower, and the shock wave from the explosions starts the bell ringing and nearly deafens the sniper and me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So he murders a dozen people, and still the FBI puts him in the Program?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Harry Crisp puts him in the Program, and once <i>anybody</i> in the FBI makes a move, they never want to reverse it; makes them look bad, they think.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll bet Crisp still has his job,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;No, thanks to a little work of mine, but he still has <i>a</i> job: He&#x2019;s the AIC in American Samoa.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Samoa</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was the most remote place they could find to send him. The AIC in Miami is now one Grant Early Harrison, who was the FBI guy I was trying to save when I stuck Trini Rodriguez. He was undercover at the time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, Grant Early Harrison must be very grateful to you,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;Grateful, but not very. He&#x2019;s how I know Trini Rodriguez is in the Program and in New York, but he stopped talking to me the moment he realized that I planned to take Trini.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So there&#x2019;s no more help forthcoming from Agent Harrison?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;None at all, the bastard, and after I got him his job, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And how did you do that?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;After this business was over, and Ed Shine and a lot of other people had been arrested, a deputy director of the FBI paid me a visit and asked me for my account of events. I managed to toss a couple of hand grenades into Harry Crisp&#x2019;s lap, resulting in his getting shipped to the farthest reaches of the Pacific Rim, and I said some very nice things about Grant, which, ultimately, got him the AIC&#x2019;s job in Miami.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t ever want you for an enemy,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not Italian, are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, but I&#x2019;m an army brat, and I put twenty years in, myself, commanding MPs.

How sweet of you!&#x201d;</p><p>Stone peeped under the napkin, too. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got one just like it,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s yours,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d give her <i>my</i> piece, did you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What are you doing with my Walther?&#x201d; Stone demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;You loaned it to me that time when we did that thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you never returned it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Holly will give it back to you after she&#x2019;s shot Trini Rodriguez a few times,&#x201d; Dino explained.</p><p>Holly slipped the weapon into her handbag and returned Dino&#x2019;s napkin.</p><p>&#x201c;Swell,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;Holly,&#x201d; Dino said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a couple of friends on the organized crime task force. I&#x2019;ll mention Rodriguez&#x2019;s name and see if anybody has heard about him. Do you know what name he&#x2019;s using in the Program?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, Grant wouldn&#x2019;t tell me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It would be a big help if you could find out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how to do that,&#x201d; Holly said.</p><p>&#x201c;Let me work on it,&#x201d; Dino replied.</p><p>Their main course arrived, and there was no more talk of Trini Rodriguez.</p><p>On the way back to Stone&#x2019;s house, in a cab, he turned to Holly. &#x201c;Are you and your friend comfortably situated upstairs?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yes, thank you. The room is very nice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure how I feel about sleeping in the same house with somebody who could stab somebody else in the neck.&#x201d;</p><p>Holly patted his knee. &#x201c;I promise not to stab you in the neck,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;At least not the first night.&#x201d;</p><p>The cab pulled up in front of Stone&#x2019;s house, and they got out. Stone went to the front door and unlocked it.</p><p>&#x201c;Hang on!&#x201d; Holly yelled. &#x201c;I left my purse in the cab!&#x201d; She ran toward the moving taxi, screaming at it.</p><p>Stone watched her catch up and stop the cab, then he turned back and stepped inside his front door. As he did, he heard a sound that made the hair stand up on the back of his neck. He froze.</p><p>Holly came up the steps behind him. &#x201c;That was close,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t move,&#x201d; Stone replied.</p><p>&#x201c;What? Oh, God. Daisy! Stand down!&#x201d; She brushed past Stone and took the dog&#x2019;s collar. &#x201c;Sit.&#x201d;</p><p>Daisy sat down and looked at Stone warily.</p><p>&#x201c;This is Stone,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Stone is good. Good.&#x201d;</p><p>Daisy walked over and nuzzled Stone&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>&#x201c;How do you do, Daisy?&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>She licked his hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry about that,&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My heart rate is returning to normal. So this is your friend?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep. Isn&#x2019;t she beautiful?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t mention that your friend is a Doberman pinscher.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Zoom</h2><p><p><b>As seen on the SERIAL podcast, season 2, episode 1 ("Dustwun")!&nbsp;</b></p><p>Open this wordless book and zoom from a farm to a ship to a city street to a desert island.

For example, one illustration shows a boy on a cruise ship, the next shows him from a distance, and the next reveals the whole ship. Finally, the viewpoint moves back farther and it turns out that the ship is actually a poster on a bus. The perspective continues to recede, revealing the bus as an image on a television screen. Three pages later, viewers see that the person watching TV is drawn on a postage stamp. The final picture shows a view of Earth from space. To heighten the effect, all of the full-color illustrations appear on the recto, while each verso is completely black. It's fun to watch the transition in perceptions as a farm becomes a toy, the girl playing with it is on a magazine cover, etc. The novelty soon wears off, however, and nothing else about the book is memorable.

The doctor-patient relationship--the heart of medicine--is broken: doctors are too distracted and overwhelmed to truly connect with their patients, and medical errors and misdiagnoses abound. In <em>Deep Medicine</em>, leading physician Eric Topol reveals how artificial intelligence can help. AI has the potential to transform everything doctors do, from notetaking and medical scans to diagnosis and treatment, greatly cutting down the cost of medicine and reducing human mortality. By freeing physicians from the tasks that interfere with human connection, AI will create space for the real healing that takes place between a doctor who can listen and a patient who needs to be heard.</p> Innovative, provocative, and hopeful, <em>Deep Medicine</em> shows us how the awesome power of AI can make medicine better, for all the humans involved. <ul> <li><strong>Illustrations note: </strong>46 Halftones, black &amp; white 11 Tables, black &amp; white</li> </ul></p><p><b>Eric Topol, MD</b>, is a world-renowned cardiologist, Executive Vice-President of Scripps Research, founder of a new medical school and one of the top ten most cited medical researchers.

His publisher turned it down, so Dickens used what little money he had to put out <i>A Christmas Carol</i> himself. He worried it might be the end of his career as a novelist.<br><br> The book immediately caused a sensation. And it breathed new life into a holiday that had fallen into disfavor, undermined by lingering Puritanism and the cold modernity of the Industrial Revolution. It was a harsh and dreary age, in desperate need of spiritual renewal, ready to embrace a book that ended with blessings for one and all.<br><br> With warmth, wit, and an infusion of Christmas cheer, Les Standiford whisks us back to Victorian England, its most beloved storyteller, and the birth of the Christmas we know best. <i>The Man Who Invented Christmas</i> is a rich and satisfying read for Scrooges and sentimentalists alike.</p><p>LES STANDIFORD is the author of the critically acclaimed <i>Last Train to Paradise, Meet You in Hell,</i> and <i>Washington Burning</i>, as well as several novels. Recipient of the Frank O&#x2019;Connor Award for Short Fiction, he is Founding Director of the Creative Writing Program at Florida International University in Miami, where he lives with his wife and three children.Nativity<br><br>In London, in 1824, it was the custom to treat a debtor little differently from a man who had reached into a purse and stolen a similar sum. In this case, he was a father of seven, and though he was gainfully employed, it was not gainful enough. His debt was to a baker, a man named Karr, who lived in Camden Street, and the sum was forty pounds, no small amount in those days, when an oyster was a penny, a whole salmon a pound and six, and a clerk who worked for a tightfisted miser in a countinghouse might not earn as much in a year.<br><br>Accounts were tallied, the sheriff was consulted, and men were sent in consequence. Our father&#x2014;John his name, and thirty-seven&#x2014;was taken by the sheriff&#x2019;s men to what was called a &#x201c;spong�ing house,&#x201d; a kind of purgatory where those who could not meet their obligations were afforded some few days to seek relief from their creditors&#x2019; charges, intervention from a person of influence, or possibly a loan from family or friends.<br><br>In this instance, help was not forthcoming. Two days passed with no good word, and then our John, officially an insolvent debtor, was passed along to the Marshalsea, imprisoned alongside smugglers, mutineers, and pirates. &#x201c;The sun has set on me, forever,&#x201d; he told his family as he left.<br><br>One who tried to help was a son of John, who, then twelve, took a job, at six shillings a week in a tumbledown �factory-house that sat on the banks of the River Thames. One day long afterward the boy would speak of the place, &#x201c;Its wainscoted rooms and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, and the sound of their squeaking and scuffing coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again.&#x201d;<br><br>His job was to fill small pots with shoe blacking, and tie them off with paper, and then to paste on each a printed label. The boy worked ten hours a day, standing near a window for better light and where any passersby might see him, with a break for a meal at noon, and one for tea later on. And though the place was grim and the work was numbing, and this had put his childhood to an end, he worked on. For his father was in prison. For a debt of forty pounds. For his family&#x2019;s bread.<br><br>&#x201c;My whole nature was so penetrated with the grief and humiliation of such considerations,&#x201d; the boy would one day write, &#x201c;that even now . . . I often forget in my dreams that I have a dear wife and children; even that I am a man; and [I] wander desolately back to that time of my life.&#x201d;<br><br>While these words testify to the force of a childhood blow, they also offer reassurance that there would one day come a lightening of his circumstances. That the boy would not spend forever in his dismal occupation, nor would his father stay forever in the Marshalsea, though there were three long months there, with our young man visiting his father in a tiny room behind high spiked walls, and where, the boy recalls, they &#x201c;cried very much.&#x201d;<br><br>And where his father told him &#x201c;to take warning by the Marshalsea, and to observe that if a man had twenty pounds a year, and spent nineteen pounds nineteen shillings and sixpence, he would be happy; but that a shilling spent the other way would make him wretched.&#x201d; These words of caution, and lament, and more, and then at 10:00 p.m. the warning bell would toll and our young man of twelve would walk out into the foggy London night, five miles toward home, and some hours of oblivion before the scurrying, and the squealing, and the little pots of blacking came again.<br>The boy&#x2019;s name was Charles, of course, and his family&#x2019;s name was Dickens, and most who have commented on the life of the famed author have ob�served that those sorry experiences of his youth, described in a scrap of autobiography never published during his lifetime, constitute the most sig�nificant of his formative years. All art grows out of its maker&#x2019;s loss, it has been said&#x2014;and if that is so, Dickens&#x2019;s loss of his childhood was to become the world&#x2019;s great gain.<br><br>Dickens, who is generally considered one of the most �ac�complished writers in the English language, published twenty novels in his lifetime&#x2014;he died in 1870&#x2014;and none of them has ever gone out of print. His personal experience of harsh working conditions and a deep sympathy for the poor inform much of his writing, and more than one scholar has made a life&#x2019;s work out of tracing the parallels between the �author&#x2019;s life and his fiction. The number of academic books, dissertations, monographs, and articles devoted to Dickens and such lengthy works as Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Bleak House and Great Expectations, is, practically speaking, beyond counting.<br><br>But perhaps the best known and certainly the most be�loved of all Dickens&#x2019;s works has received relatively little study. Though A Christmas Carol abounds in references to Dickens&#x2019;s life, and is the very apotheosis of his themes&#x2014;and though it is exquisitely crafted, often referred to as his most &#x201c;perfect&#x201d; work&#x2014;critical attention has been scant.<br><br>Perhaps it is because the book is short, fewer than 30,000 words; perhaps it is because of its very popularity, its readership said at the turn of the twentieth century to be second only to the Bible&#x2019;s; or perhaps it is because of the difficulty or the irrele�vance of analyzing what is simply very good. Dickens&#x2019;s contemporary, William Makepeace Thackeray, as scathing a critic as ever walked the streets of London, once said of it, &#x201c;Who can listen to objections regarding such a book as this? It seems to me a national benefit, and to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness.&#x201d;<br><br>Perhaps the most surprising thing about the story behind this well-known story, however, is the pivotal role it played both in Dickens&#x2019;s career and in cultural history itself. At the time he sat down to write his &#x201c;slender volume,&#x201d; Dickens&#x2019;s once unequaled popularity was at a nadir, his critical reputation in a shambles, his bank account overdrawn.<br><br>Faced with bankruptcy, he was contemplating giving up on writing fiction altogether. Instead, he pulled himself �together and, in six short weeks, wrote a book that not only restored him in the eyes of the public but began the transformation of what was then a second-tier holiday into the most significant celebration of the Christian calendar.<br><br>However, as many an old storyteller has put it, we have gotten a bit ahead of ourselves.<br>Mean Season<br><br>1.<br><br>On the evening of October 5, 1843, thirty-one-year-old Charles Dickens sat on a stage in the smoke-laden city of Manchester, surely unaware that on this evening a process would begin that would change his life&#x2014;and Western culture&#x2014;forever. At the moment he was simply trying to pay attention as fellow novelist and junior member of Parliament Benjamin Disraeli completed his remarks to their eager audience.<br><br>Dickens and Disraeli, along with political firebrand Richard Cobden, were the featured speakers for this special program, a fund-raiser for the Manchester Athenaeum, the industrial capital&#x2019;s primary beacon of arts and enlightenment. Designed by Charles Berg, architect of the Houses of Parliament, the Athenaeum&#x2019;s headquarters (as well as its mission) was greatly revered by culture-starved workingmen and the more progressive of the city&#x2019;s leaders. But a lingering downturn in the nation&#x2019;s economy&#x2014;part of the industrial revolution&#x2019;s ceaseless cycle of boom and bust&#x2014;had sent the Athenaeum into serious debt and placed its future in doubt.<br><br>Hoping to turn the tide, Cobden, a Manchester alderman and also an MP, had joined with other concerned citizens to lay plans for a bazaar and &#x201c;grand soir�e&#x201d; in the adjoining Free Trade Hall. A popular and vociferous opponent of the onerous Corn Laws, which imposed stiff duties on imported grain and inflated the profits of England&#x2019;s landowners at the expense of a citizenry often unable to buy bread, Cobden could always be counted upon to draw an audience. But with the addition of popular authors Disraeli and Dickens to the bill, the promoters hoped for a bonanza of shopping and new subscriptions that would secure the future of the Athenaeum once and for all.<br><br>Disraeli&#x2014;the man who would go on to serve nearly forty years in his nation&#x2019;s government, including two stints as prime minister, propelling his country into such epic undertakings as the annexation of Cyprus and the building of the Suez Canal&#x2014;was at that time simply the socially conscious son of Jewish parents, a budding politician who had left the study of law to write a series of popular romances.<br><br>The evening&#x2019;s headliner, however, was Dickens, who had become perhaps the world&#x2019;s first true celebrity of the popular arts. The author of Sketches by Boz, The Pickwick Papers, Oliver Twist, Nicholas Nickleby, and The Old Curiosity Shop was far and away his country&#x2019;s best-selling author, acclaimed as much for his themes&#x2014;the passionate portrayals of the misery of the poor and the presumption and posturing of the rich&#x2014;as for his spellbinding powers as a storyteller. And yet, for all his accomplishments, Dickens sat upon that Manchester stage a troubled man. True, he had risen from a poverty-stricken childhood of his own to enjoy unimaginable success and influ�ence. But what preoccupied him on that evening was how rapidly&#x2014;and how unaccountably&#x2014;his good fortune had fled.<br>In fact, an account of Dickens&#x2019;s rise from his miserable days in a London boot-blacking factory up until the time of his appearance in Manchester reads like melodrama:<br><br>His education was first interrupted at the age of twelve, when his father&#x2014;a naval pay clerk who always struggled to meet his obligations&#x2014;was imprisoned for debt (in time, the rest of the family, including Dickens&#x2019;s mother, Elizabeth, and his three younger brothers and sisters finally joined his father in Marshalsea). Though he was able to resume school briefly after his father was released, the family&#x2019;s fortunes plunged again, and at fifteen, young Charles was taken from school and apprenticed as a law clerk. Though he found the work there only slightly less dismal than the bottling of boot polish&#x2014;and though he quickly came to loathe the hypocrisy of a labyrinthine and self-serving legal system&#x2014;he formed a lifelong commitment to the distinction between &#x201c;justice&#x201d; and &#x201c;the law.&#x201d;<br><br>In 1829, at the age of seventeen, Dickens took a job as a court stenographer, and five years later, at twenty-two, be�gan writing for a British newspaper, the Morning Chronicle, which dispatched him across the country to cover various elections. Along the way, Dickens discovered an interest in and facility for writing of the foibles, eccentricities, and trag�edies embedded in the nation&#x2019;s legal and political machinations; his keen eye and caustic wit enabled him to place a number of pieces in periodicals, a practice that not only supplemented his income but gratified his ego as well.<br><br>Of his first publication, a sketch titled &#x201c;A Dinner at Pop�lar Walk,&#x201d; in the December 1833 issue of Monthly Magazine, Dickens recalls the purchase of &#x201c;my first copy of the magazine in which my first effusion&#x2014;dropped stealthily one evening at twilight, with fear and trembling, into a dark letter-box, in a dark office, up a court in Fleet Street&#x2014;appeared in all the glory of print; on which occasion by-the-bye,&#x2014;how well I recollect it!&#x2014;I walked down to Westminster Hall, and turned into it for half-an-hour, because my eyes were so dimmed with joy and pride, that they could not bear the street, and were not fit to be seen there.&#x201d;<br><br>While many of his first &#x201c;outside&#x201d; publications took the form of rudimentary short stories, Dickens began to make a name for himself with his nonfiction work for the Chronicle, especially the series of &#x201c;Street Sketches&#x201d; that offered readers for the first time a vivid and empathetic view of ordinary London life. Pieces such as &#x201c;Brokers and Marine Store Shops,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Old Bailey,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Shabby-Genteel People,&#x201d; not only fascinated the readers of Dickens&#x2019;s time but foreshadowed the dramatic style of today&#x2019;s so-called new journalism. As the critic Michael Slater notes, &#x201c;Already in these sketches Dickens is experimenting, very effectively, with that blending of the wildly comic and the intensely pathetic that was to win and keep him such thousands of devoted readers in after years.&#x201d;<br><br>This success in the Morning Chronicle led its publisher, George Hogarth, to invite Dickens to fashion a similar piece for the launch of a new publication, the Evening Chronicle. Soon Dickens was contributing regularly to the new publi�cation and others, signing off as &#x201c;Boz,&#x201d; and creating something of a stir in London literary circles. In October of 1835, the publisher John Macrone offered Dickens one hundred pounds for the rights to publish a collection of Sketches by Boz, a handsome sum for a young reporter making just seven pounds per week.<br><br>Writers&#x2019; use of pseudonyms for the publication of literary items was a standard affectation of the time, and more than a small amount of gossip arose among those &#x201c;in the know&#x201d; as to the true identity of such widely read figures as Fitzboodle, Titmarsh, and Mr. C. J. Yellowplush. Dickens was fond of passing along to friends the contents of a hush-hush note he had received informing him in no uncertain terms that the writer behind the moniker of &#x201c;Boz&#x201d; was none other than his friend and fellow essayist Leigh Hunt.<br><br>It was not until advertisements for Sketches were placed that the true identity of &#x201c;Boz&#x201d; (taken from a childhood nickname for Dickens&#x2019;s youngest brother, Augustus) was revealed, and for several years afterward, Dickens maintained the good-natured and popular affectation. Friends called him Boz, and Dickens often referred to himself in the third person as Boz. (Later he would be f�ted at the &#x201c;Boz Ball&#x201d; during a tour of the United States, and as late as 1843, his novel Martin Chuzzlewit, though acknowledging its author as Charles Dickens, still carried the notation &#x201c;Edited by Boz&#x201d; on its title page.)<br><br>Sketches was published in February of 1836 and met with unqualified success. Suddenly, Dickens saw himself vali�dated as a spokesman for the underclass and an appointed foe of buffoonery, unwarranted privilege, and chicanery. One pa�per lauded him as &#x201c;a kind of Boswell to society,&#x201d; and another called the sketches &#x201c;a perfect picture of the morals, manners, and habits of a great portion of English Society.&#x201d; John Forster, who would one day become Dickens&#x2019;s great friend, adviser, ed�i�tor, and first biographer, wrote in the Examiner that Dickens</p><h2>Stranger Things: Runaway Max</h2><p><b>Don't miss this gripping, emotional prequel to the hit Netflix series, <i>Stranger Things</i>!

Here in <i>Bonfire Opera,</i> grief and Eros grapple in the same domain. A bullet-hole through the heart, a house full of ripe persimmons, a ghost in a garden.

From the Oval Office to Camp David, from his study in the private quarters of the White House to Air Force One, from the fall of the Berlin Wall to the first Gulf War to the end of Communism, <i>Destiny and Power</i> charts the thoughts, decisions, and emotions of a modern president who may have been the last of his kind. This is the human story of a man who was, like the nation he led, at once noble and flawed.<br><br> His was one of the great American lives. Born into a loving, privileged, and competitive family, Bush joined the navy on his eighteenth birthday and at age twenty was shot down on a combat mission over the Pacific. He married young, started a family, and resisted pressure to go to Wall Street, striking out for the adventurous world of Texas oil. Over the course of three decades, Bush would rise from the chairmanship of his county Republican Party to serve as congressman, ambassador to the United Nations, head of the Republican National Committee, envoy to China, director of Central Intelligence, vice president under Ronald Reagan, and, finally, president of the United States. In retirement he became the first president since John Adams to see his son win the ultimate prize in American politics.<br><br> With access not only to the Bush diaries but, through extensive interviews, to the former president himself, Meacham presents Bush&#x2019;s candid assessments of many of the critical figures of the age, ranging from Richard Nixon to Nancy Reagan; Mao to Mikhail Gorbachev; Dick Cheney to Donald Rumsfeld; Henry Kissinger to Bill Clinton. Here is high politics as it really is but as we rarely see it.<br><br> From the Pacific to the presidency, <i>Destiny and Power</i> charts the vicissitudes of the life of this quietly compelling American original. Meacham sheds new light on the rise of the right wing in the Republican Party, a shift that signaled the beginning of the end of the center in American politics. <i>Destiny and Power</i> is an affecting portrait of a man who, driven by destiny and by duty, forever sought, ultimately, to put the country first.<br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Destiny and Power<br></i></b><br>&#x201c;Should be required reading&#x2014;if not for every presidential candidate, then for every president-elect.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Reflects the qualities of both subject and biographer: judicious, balanced, deliberative, with a deep appreciation of history and the personalities who shape it.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;A fascinating biography of the forty-first president.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Dallas Morning News</i></b></p><p><b>Jon Meacham&nbsp;</b>is a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning biographer.

W. Bush<br><br>Failure seems to be regarded as the one unpardonable crime, success as the one all-redeeming virtue, the acquisition of wealth as the single worthy aim of life.<br><br>&#x2014;Charles Francis Adams, Jr.<br><br> To Samuel Prescott Bush&#x2014;&#x201c;Bushy&#x201d; to his beloved first wife, Flora&#x2014;the ocean seemed to go on forever. The view from the top of the Hotel Traymore overlooking the boardwalk in Atlantic City at Illinois Avenue was grand, and unique: A publicist for the hotel assured the press that the Traymore roof was &#x201c;the most elevated point on the Atlantic coast south of the Statue of Liberty.&#x201d; (&#x201c;In absence of evidence to the contrary,&#x201d; a reporter added, &#x201c;we take his word for it.&#x201d;) A prominent Midwestern industrialist, Bush was at the Jersey Shore in the early summer of 1915 to take part in what was described as &#x201c;the highest golf driving contest ever held in the history of the great Scotch game.&#x201d;<br><br>In from Columbus, Ohio, where he presided over Buckeye Steel Castings, a manufacturer of railroad parts, the tall, angular Bush looked out from a makeshift tee atop the brick hotel two hundred feet above the beach. A favorite of well-heeled visitors to Atlantic City, the domed Traymore had just undergone renovations that Bankers&#x2019; Magazine solemnly reported had turned the hotel into a showplace with &#x201c;700 rooms and 700 baths&#x201d;&#x2014;the kind of construction project that was making grandeur ever more accessible to men who were building a prosperous business class.<br><br>S. P. Bush was one such man. The son of an Episcopal clergyman, Bush, who was to become George H. W. Bush&#x2019;s paternal grandfather, had spent much of his childhood in New York and New Jersey. After college, Bush went west, finding his future at Buckeye, a company backed by the railroad baron E. H. Harriman and run, in the first decade of the new century, by a brother of John D. Rockefeller, Frank. President of Buckeye since 1908 and a director of numerous railway companies, S. P. Bush had grown rich. Now standing on the roof of the Hotel Traymore, he was part of an emerging American elite&#x2014;one based not on birth but on success and achievement. Facing the Atlantic, in a long-sleeved dress shirt and formal trousers, Bush, driver in hand, took his stance and swung smoothly. He connected just the way he wanted to&#x2014;cleanly and perfectly. The ball rose rapidly, a tiny spinning meteor. Bush&#x2019;s shot streaked out over the blue-green water, soaring over the white-capped waves before disappearing deep in the distance, the sound of its splash lost in the wind and surf.<br><br>Bush won, of course. Though his opponents did what they could, they failed to surpass Bush&#x2019;s dramatic drive. It was not the most serious of competitions, but that did not matter. The New York Times reported Bush&#x2019;s triumph. A contest was a contest.<br><br>To win was to be alive; to compete was as natural as breathing&#x2014;a common code among the ancestors of George Herbert Walker Bush. Theirs is a story of big men and strong women, ambitious husbands and fathers taking unconventional risks&#x2014;in business, in politics, even in religion&#x2014;while wives and mothers who might have expected fairly staid lives adapt and emerge as impressive figures in their own rights. Across more than two centuries, maternal and paternal lines reinforced and supported one another, producing generation after generation driven by both the pursuit of wealth and by a sense of public service.<br><br>Bush&#x2019;s ancestors were in America from the beginning. Some arrived on the Mayflower, settling in New England and New York. On the night of Tuesday, April 18, 1775, the Massachusetts patriot Dr. Samuel Prescott, a Bush forebear, rode with Paul Revere and William Dawes to warn Concord of the pending British invasion. Only Prescott made it all the way through the night.<br><br>Obadiah Bush, George H. W. Bush&#x2019;s great-great-grandfather, was born in 1797, served in the War of 1812 at age fifteen, and became a schoolmaster in Cayuga County, New York. He married a pupil (a young woman whom family tradition recalled as the &#x201c;comely&#x201d; Harriet Smith), and went into business in Rochester. He fell on hard times and, in distress, unsuccessfully turned to Senator William Seward (who would join Lincoln&#x2019;s cabinet much later) in search of government preferment in San Francisco or in Rio de Janeiro.<br><br>Gold, or at least the prospect of it, saved him, then killed him. Obadiah grew obsessed with news of the gold rush in California, journeying west to look into mining opportunities in the San Francisco area. He liked what he found but died before he could collect his family and permanently relocate.<br><br>Obadiah&#x2019;s eldest son, James Smith Bush, who would become George H. W. Bush&#x2019;s great-grandfather, barely made it out of infancy. Born in 1825, he was described as &#x201c;a puny and sickly child, of fragile build, with weak lungs.&#x201d; A doctor was harsh with Harriet Bush, James Smith Bush&#x2019;s mother: &#x201c;You had better knock him in the head, for [even] if he lives he will never amount to anything.&#x201d; He survived, and, in 1841, at sixteen, enrolled at Yale College. James Smith Bush was popular and charming, a good student, and an excellent athlete, especially at crew. &#x201c;His classmates speak of him as tall and slender in person, rather grave of mien, except when engaged in earnest conversation or good-humored repartee; ever kind and considerate, and always a gentleman&#x2014;still very strong in his likes and dislikes,&#x201d; a friend of Bush&#x2019;s wrote. &#x201c;He made many friends.&#x201d;<br><br>These and other family traits became evident in Bush&#x2019;s life during his Yale years. There was a restlessness, an eagerness to break away from the established order of life, but not so much that one could not return. There was a kind of moderation, a discomfort with extremes or dogma. There was a capacity to charm and a fondness for attractive women. And there was also a sense of familial duty. At college he realized that his father, Obadiah, was short of money, and so James Smith Bush sought professional security in the law. On a visit to Saratoga Springs as a young attorney, he was dazzled by the passing figure of Sarah Freeman, the daughter of a local doctor. She was, it was said, &#x201c;the most beautiful woman of this place,&#x201d; and Bush fell in love. They married in October 1851, and he took her to live in Rochester.<br><br>It was a love match. Bush adored his bride, and the world seemed a brighter, happier place to him with her in it. Then, eighteen months after the wedding, Sarah Freeman Bush died, devastating her young husband into near insensibility. Shattered by the loss of his wife, Bush sought consolation in religion. Initially a Presbyterian, he had become an Episcopalian under Sarah&#x2019;s influence. Now, in the wake of the calamity of her death, Bush was ordained a priest and took charge of Grace Church in Orange, New Jersey, in June 1855. He eventually found another great love: Harriet Eleanor Fay. Like Bush&#x2019;s first wife, Harriet was said to be &#x201c;brilliant and beautiful.&#x201d; The poet James Russell Lowell admired her extravagantly. &#x201c;She possessed the finest mind,&#x201d; Lowell remarked, &#x201c;and was the most brilliant woman, intellectually, of the young women of my day.&#x201d; Bush&#x2019;s head turned anew, he married Harriet Fay at Trinity Church in New York in 1859. The marriage was a happy one, producing four children, including, on Sunday, October 4, 1863, a son they named Samuel Prescott Bush&#x2014;S.P.<br><br>While Obadiah appears to have had a gambler&#x2019;s temperament, James Smith Bush was moderate in tone and philosophy. Amid a controversy over the teaching of the Bible in public schools, the Reverend Bush preached a sermon in support of the separation of church and state. A strong Union man during the Civil War, Bush spoke to public gatherings celebrating the North&#x2019;s triumphs at Vicksburg and at Gettysburg and reportedly flew the American flag at his church against the wishes of the neighborhood&#x2019;s Southern sympathizers. After the grim news from Ford&#x2019;s Theatre on the evening of Good Friday, 1865, Bush wrote a sermon to commemorate the martyred Abraham Lincoln. &#x201c;Be assured, my brethren, as that great and good man did not live in vain, so he has not died in vain,&#x201d; Bush told his Easter congregation that Sunday. &#x201c;The President was an instrument in the hands of God.&#x201d;<br><br>The popular Bush served as chaplain on an expedition around Cape Horn to California under Commodore John &#x201c;Fighting Jack&#x201d; Rodgers and spent several years at Grace Church on Nob Hill in San Francisco before returning east in 1872, where he became rector of the Church of the Ascension at West Brighton, Staten Island. There the strains of the second great spiritual crisis of Bush&#x2019;s life became apparent. Forged in the fire of his grief over the death of his first wife, Sarah, his faith was fading. The more miraculous elements of the creeds&#x2014;the Virgin Birth was one example&#x2014;now seemed implausible to him. &#x201c;I discovered early in my acquaintance with Mr. Bush that his theological garments were outgrown,&#x201d; said Dr. Horatio Stebbins of San Francisco, a leading Unitarian.<br><br>On a visit to the Ashfield, Massachusetts, home of George William Curtis, the editor of Harper&#x2019;s Weekly, Bush discussed his shifting views on religion. Curtis introduced his guest to a poem of Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x2019;s entitled &#x201c;The Problem,&#x201d; which tells the story of a believer who has fallen out of love with the trappings of earthly ecclesiastical institutions, beginning with the &#x201c;cowl,&#x201d; or a long robe with deep sleeves and a hood.<br><br>I like a church; I like a cowl;<br><br>I love a prophet of the soul;<br><br>and on my heart monastic aisles<br><br>Fall like sweet strains, or pensive smiles;<br><br>Yet not for all his faith can see<br><br>Would I that cowled churchman be.<br><br>Why should the vest on him allure,<br><br>Which I could not on me endure?<br><br>Bush was stunned at how Emerson&#x2019;s verses resonated. &#x201c;Why, why,&#x201d; Bush told Curtis, &#x201c;that is my faith.&#x201d; Around Christmas 1883 he resigned from his parish and moved his family to Concord, Massachusetts, a center of inquiry and of Unitarianism infused with the spirits of Emerson and Thoreau.<br><br>On Monday, November 11, 1889, James Smith Bush died after a heart attack. A eulogy underscored his love of politics and his gentleness of temper. &#x201c;Interested in all public questions, possessing strong opinions, and having the courage of his convictions, he never was offensive or aggressive in asserting them,&#x201d; a friend said of Bush. He was buried in Ithaca, where he and his family had moved yet again, his restless journey done.<br><br>Mechanics and money, not metaphysics, was top of mind for Bush&#x2019;s son Samuel Prescott Bush. In this, George H. W. Bush&#x2019;s grandfather reflected the larger currents of the time. The post&#x2013;Civil War era found its name in Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner&#x2019;s novel The Gilded Age. The excesses of the era, including the exploitation of labor and the attendant growth in the gap between the few and the many, led to the important work of the Progressives. Yet, among elements of the Gilded Age elite there was an expectation that money brought with it certain responsibilities. Andrew Carnegie articulated this new faith in &#x201c;The Gospel of Wealth,&#x201d; published in 1889:<br><br>This, then, is held to be the duty of the man of wealth: To set an example of modest, unostentatious living, shunning display or extravagance; to provide moderately for the legitimate wants of those dependent upon him; and, after doing so, to consider all surplus revenues which come to him simply as trust funds, which he is called upon to administer, and strictly bound as a matter of duty to administer in the manner which, in his judgment, is best calculated to produce the most beneficial results for the community&#x2014;the man of wealth thus becoming the mere trustee and agent for his poorer brethren, bringing to their service his superior wisdom, experience, and ability to administer, doing for them better than they would or could do for themselves.<br><br>The pursuit of wealth was thus imbued with a sense of purpose. America, wrote the banker Henry Clews, was &#x201c;the land of the self-made man.&#x201d;<br><br>S.P. attended the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, a choice suggesting he had decided to seek his career in a world of certitude and of science rather than in his father&#x2019;s ethos of twilight and of theology, devoting himself to engineering, manufacture&#x2014;and money making. After graduating from Stevens in 1884, Bush worked for a number of railroads, moving between Logansport, Indiana; Columbus, Ohio; and Milwaukee. In 1901, he returned to Columbus to join the Buckeye Castings Company, whose railroad parts were widely praised for being of the &#x201c;highest grade.&#x201d;<br><br>Late on the afternoon of Tuesday, October 14, 1902, in Columbus, Buckeye invited spectators to witness the shift from the older world of iron to the new, more profitable universe of steel. Watching a crane and furnace at work at Buckeye, a reporter for The Columbus Citizen wrote &#x201c;the steel came pouring forth in a stream of liquid fire amid a cloud of fiery spray. It was a beautiful sight, indeed.&#x201d; So began S. P. Bush&#x2019;s long career at Buckeye, one that made him rich and&#x2014;crucial for the Bush family&#x2019;s self-image&#x2014;&#x201c;respected,&#x201d; as his grandson George H. W. Bush recalled. The Bushes were a big force in a big town in a big time. And S. P. Bush, who married a Columbus native, Flora Sheldon, was a big man. &#x201c;Grandfather Bush was quite severe,&#x201d; recalled George&#x2019;s sister, Nancy Bush Ellis. &#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t mean, but so correct.&#x201d; He was, a Buckeye colleague recalled, &#x201c;a snorter . . . Everyone knew when he was around; when he issued orders, boy it went!&#x201d;<br><br>There was championship level golf; the leading of charities; the building of a great house with elaborate gardens; a critical role in creating the Ohio State football program; the establishment of the Ohio Manufacturers&#x2019; Association; and, politically, a voice in both the state&#x2019;s Democratic Party and in the anti-tax Ohio Tax League. There was also the support of symphonies, of art galleries, of literary and cultural gatherings. S.P. expected hard work from others and from himself. Determined and focused, he was often asked to serve as a director on the boards of other companies&#x2014;perhaps the highest compliment one businessman can pay another. Yet, Bush spoke of himself in a humble, self-improving tone: &#x201c;I could be a lot better man if I could do a little more of some things and less of others, and I would like to be a better man too.&#x201d;<br><br>Flora, who was engaged by many things&#x2014;gardening, design, history&#x2014;saw her main role as that of a supportive wife. &#x201c;Let me know dear what you are doing&#x2014;the little details of your days &amp; nights&#x2014;for they are my greatest interest in life,&#x201d; Flora wrote S.P. when he was away on business. &#x201c;You are a very dear Bushy, adored by your children and tenderly loved by your wife &amp; loved more today than ever before.&#x201d;<br><br>The eldest of those children was Prescott Sheldon Bush. Born in Columbus on Wednesday, May 15, 1895, Prescott was high-spirited, savoring athletic success and attention. After church one summer day at Osterville, a Cape Cod village where the Bushes spent time in the summers, lunch with the family was raucous. &#x201c;The children were hilarious to such a degree I think your poor mother&#x2019;s head whirled,&#x201d; Flora wrote her husband. &#x201c;Prescott is after all a naughty boy on occasion&#x2014;he kept the ball rolling so that I was helpless&#x201d; with laughter.</p><h2>The Impersonal Life</h2><p>The Impersonal Life is one of the key books written on the topic of self-discovery and leading a spiritual life.

Every important incident is mentioned and every detail of the story is true. It is filled with vivid descriptions of Bach&#39;s childhood: how he sat up many nights and copied music by the light of the moon, and how he walked two hundred miles to a choir school at L�neburg. Then his adult life: how he helped his wife Magdalena put the twenty children to bed every night; how he spread brown bread with honey for them to eat every afternoon; and how he taught them all to sing and play different musical instruments. The music reproduced here represents all of the different kinds of music that Bach ever wrote. A child can never really know music unless he knows Bach, for his contribution is the foundation and structural basis of all music. But it is more the human side of this book that will make it live, for in it the great master breathes. All who read it will know him...not only as a musical genius, but also as an eager child, an affectionate father, and a lovable human being.</p><p></p><h2>The Alchemy of Us: How Humans and Matter Transformed One Another (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>In the bestselling tradition of <i>Stuff Matters</i> and <i>The Disappearing Spoon</i>: a clever and engaging look at materials, the innovations they made possible, and how these technologies changed us. </b></p><p>In <i>The Alchemy of Us</i>, scientist and science writer Ainissa Ramirez examines eight inventions&#x2015;clocks, steel rails, copper communication cables, photographic film, light bulbs, hard disks, scientific labware, and silicon chips&#x2015;and reveals how they shaped the human experience. Ramirez tells the stories of the woman who sold time, the inventor who inspired Edison, and the hotheaded undertaker whose invention pointed the way to the computer. She describes, among other things, how our pursuit of precision in timepieces changed how we sleep; how the railroad helped commercialize Christmas; how the necessary brevity of the telegram influenced Hemingway's writing style; and how a young chemist exposed the use of Polaroid's cameras to create passbooks to track black citizens in apartheid South Africa. These fascinating and inspiring stories offer new perspectives on our relationships with technologies. </p><p>Ramirez shows how materials were shaped by inventors, but also how those materials shaped culture, chronicling each invention and its consequences&#x2015;intended and unintended. Filling in the gaps left by other books about technology, Ramirez showcases little-known inventors&#x2015;particularly people of color and women&#x2015;who had a significant impact but whose accomplishments have been hidden by mythmaking, bias, and convention. Doing so, she shows us the power of telling inclusive stories about technology. She also shows that innovation is universal&#x2015;whether it's splicing beats with two turntables and a microphone or splicing genes with two test tubes and CRISPR. <br>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Ainissa Ramirez is a materials scientist and sought-after public speaker and science communicator. A Brown and Stanford graduate, she has worked as a research scientist at Bell Labs and held academic positions at Yale University and MIT.

I felt a lot of sympathy for it since fighting outside my weight class was something I was intimately familiar with. I&#x2019;m a coyote shapeshifter playing in a world of werewolves and vampires&#x2014;outmatched is an understatement.</p><p>&#x201c;One more time,&#x201d; I told Gabriel, my seventeen-year-old office manager, who was sitting in the driver&#x2019;s seat of his mother&#x2019;s Buick. I sniffed and dried my nose on the shoulder of my work overalls. Runny noses are part and parcel of working in the winter.</p><p>I love being a mechanic, runny nose, greasy hands, and all.</p><p>It&#x2019;s a life full of frustration and barked knuckles, followed by brief moments of triumph that make all the rest worthwhile. I find it a refuge from the chaos my life has been lately: no one is likely to die if I can&#x2019;t fix his car.</p><p>Not even if it is his mother&#x2019;s car. It had been a short day at school, and Gabriel had used his free time to try to fix his mother&#x2019;s car. He&#x2019;d taken it from running badly to not at all, then had a friend tow it to the shop to see if I could fix it.</p><p>The Buick made a few more unhealthy noises. I stepped back from the open engine compartment. Fuel, fire, and air make the engine run&#x2014;providing that the engine in question isn&#x2019;t toast.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not catching, Mercy,&#x201d; said Gabriel, as if I hadn&#x2019;t noticed.</p><p>He gripped the steering wheel with elegant but work-roughened hands. There was a smear of grease on his cheekbone, and one eye was red because he hadn&#x2019;t put on safety glasses when he&#x2019;d crawled under the car. He&#x2019;d been rewarded with a big chunk of crud&#x2014;rusty metal and grease&#x2014;in his eye.</p><p>Even though my big heaters were keeping the edge off the cold, we both wore jackets. There is no way to keep a shop truly warm when you are running garage doors up and down all day.</p><p>&#x201c;Mercy, my <i>mam�</i> has to be at work in an hour.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The good news is that I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s anything you did.&#x201d; I stepped away from the engine compartment and met his frantic eyes. &#x201c;The bad news is that it&#x2019;s not going to be running in an hour. Jury&#x2019;s out on whether it will be back on the road at all.&#x201d;</p><p>He slid out of the car and leaned under the hood to stare at the Little Engine That Couldn&#x2019;t as if he might find some wire I hadn&#x2019;t noticed that would miraculously make it run. I left him to his brooding and went through the hall to my office.</p><p>Behind the counter was a grubby, used-to-be-white board with hooks where I put the keys of cars I was working on&#x2014;and a half dozen mystery keys that predated my tenure. I pulled a set of keys attached to a rainbow peace-sign keychain, then trotted back to the garage. Gabriel was back to sitting behind the wheel of his mother&#x2019;s Buick and looking sick. I handed him the keys through the open window.</p><p>&#x201c;Take the Bug,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;Tell your mom that the turn signals don&#x2019;t blink, so she&#x2019;ll have to use hand signals. And tell her not to pull back on the steering wheel too hard or it will come off.&#x201d;</p><p>His face got stubborn.</p><p>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; I said before he could refuse, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s not going to cost me anything. It won&#x2019;t hold all the kids&#x201d;&#x2014;not that the Buick did; there were a lot of kids&#x2014;&#x201c;and it doesn&#x2019;t have much of a heater. But it runs, and I&#x2019;m not using it. We&#x2019;ll work on the Buick after hours until it&#x2019;s done, and you can owe me that many hours.&#x201d;</p><p>I was pretty sure the engine had gone to the great junkyard in the sky&#x2014;and I knew that Sylvia, Gabriel&#x2019;s mother, couldn&#x2019;t afford to buy a new engine, any more than she could buy a newer car. So I&#x2019;d call upon Zee, my old mentor, to work his magic on it. Literal magic&#x2014;there was not much figurative about Zee. He was a fae, a gremlin whose natural element was metal.</p><p>&#x201c;The Bug&#x2019;s your project car, Mercy.&#x201d; Gabriel&#x2019;s protest was weak.</p><p>My last project car, a Karmann Ghia, had sold. My take of the profits, shared with a terrific bodyman and an upholsterer, had purchased a &#x2019;71 Beetle and a &#x2019;65 VW Bus with a little left over. The Bus was beautiful and didn&#x2019;t run; the Bug had the opposite problem.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll work on the Bus first. Take the keys.&#x201d;</p><p>The expression on his face was older than it should have been. &#x201c;Only if you&#x2019;ll let the girls come over and clean on Saturdays until we get the Bug back to you.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;m not dumb. His little sisters knew how to work&#x2014;I was getting the better of the bargain.</p><p>&#x201c;Deal,&#x201d; I said before he could take it back. I shoved the keys into his hand. &#x201c;Go take the car to Sylvia before she&#x2019;s late.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come back afterward.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s late. I&#x2019;m going home. Just come at the usual time tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>Tomorrow was Saturday. Officially, I was closed on the weekends, but recent excursions to fight vampires had cut into my bottom line. So I&#x2019;d been staying open later and working on the weekend to make a little extra money.</p><p>There is no cash in battling evil: just the opposite in my experience. Hopefully, I was done with vampires&#x2014;the last incident had nearly gotten me killed, and my luck was due to run out; a woman whose best talent was changing into a coyote had no business in the big leagues.</p><p>I sent Gabriel on his way and started the process of closing up. Garage doors down, heat turned to sixty, lights off. Till drawer in the safe, my purse out. Just as I reached for the final light switch, my cell phone rang.</p><p>&#x201c;Mercy?&#x201d; It was Zee&#x2019;s son, Tad, who was going to an Ivy League college back East on full scholarship. The fae were considered a minority, so his official status as half-fae and his grades had gotten him in&#x2014;hard work was keeping him there.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Tad. What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I got an odd message on my cell phone last night. Did Phin give you something?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Phin?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Phineas Brewster, the guy I sent you to when the police had Dad up on murder charges and you needed some information about the fae to find out who really killed that man.&#x201d;</p><p>It took me a second. &#x201c;The bookstore guy? He loaned me a book.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d been meaning to return it for a while. Just . . . how often do you get a chance to read a book about the mysterious fae, written by the fae? It was handwritten and tough to decipher, slow going&#x2014;and Phin hadn&#x2019;t seemed anxious to get it back when he&#x2019;d loaned it to me. &#x201c;Tell him I&#x2019;m sorry, and I&#x2019;ll return it to him tonight. I have a date later on, but I can get it to him before that.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a little pause. &#x201c;Actually, he was a little unclear as to whether he wanted it back or not. He just said, &#x2018;Tell Mercy to take care of that thing I gave her.&#x2019; Now I can&#x2019;t get through to him; his phone is shut off. That&#x2019;s why I called you instead.&#x201d; He made a frustrated noise. &#x201c;Thing is, Mercy, he never turns that damn phone off. He likes to make sure his grandmother can get in touch with him.&#x201d;</p><p>Grandmother? Maybe Phin was younger than I&#x2019;d thought.</p><p>&#x201c;You are worried,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>He made a self-deprecating noise. &#x201c;I know, I know. I&#x2019;m paranoid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No trouble,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I ought to get it back to him anyway. Unless he keeps long hours, he won&#x2019;t be at the store by the time I can get there. Do you have a home address for him?&#x201d;</p><p>He did. I wrote it down and let him go with reassurances. As I locked the door and set the security alarm, I glanced up at the hidden camera. Adam would probably not be watching&#x2014;unless someone triggered an alarm, mostly the cameras ran all by themselves and simply sent pictures to be recorded. Still . . . as I started for my car, I kissed my hand and blew it to the tiny lens that watched my every move, then mouthed, &#x201c;See you tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>My lover was worried about how well a coyote could play with the wolves, too. Being an Alpha werewolf made him a little overbearing about his concern&#x2014;and being the CEO of a security contracting firm for various government agencies gave him access to lots of tools to indulge his protective instincts. I&#x2019;d been mad about the cameras when he&#x2019;d first had them installed, but I found them reassuring now. A coyote adapts; that&#x2019;s how she survives.</p><p>PHINEAS BREWSTER LIVED ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF one of the new condo complexes in West Pasco. It didn&#x2019;t seem like the sort of place where a collector of old books would live&#x2014;but maybe he got his fill of dust, mold, and mildew at work and didn&#x2019;t need it in his home.</p><p>I was halfway between my car and the building when I realized that I hadn&#x2019;t brought the book when I got out of the car. I hesitated, but decided to leave it where it was, wrapped in a towel on the backseat of the Rabbit. The towel was to protect the book&#x2014;in case I hadn&#x2019;t gotten all the grease off my hands&#x2014;but it worked okay to disguise it from would-be thieves, which seemed unlikely here anyway.</p><p>I climbed up two sets of stairs and knocked on the door marked 3B. After a count of ten, I rang the doorbell. Nothing. I rang the doorbell one more time, and the door at 3A opened up.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not there,&#x201d; said a gruff voice.</p><p>I turned to see a skinny old man, neatly dressed in old boots, new jeans, a button-down Western shirt, and a bolo tie. All he was missing was a cowboy hat. Something&#x2014;I think it was the boots&#x2014;smelled faintly of horse. And fae.</p><p>&#x201c;He isn&#x2019;t?&#x201d;</p><p>Officially, all the fae are out to the public and have been for a long time. But the truth is that the Gray Lords who rule the fae have been very selective about which of them the public gets to know about and which ones might upset the public&#x2014;or are more useful posing as human. There are, for instance, a few senators who are fae in hiding. There is nothing in the Constitution that makes it illegal for a fae to be a senator, and the Gray Lords want to keep it that way.</p><p>This fae was working pretty hard at passing for human; he wouldn&#x2019;t appreciate me pointing out that he wasn&#x2019;t. So I kept my discovery to myself.</p><p>There was a twinkle in the faded eyes as he shook his head. &#x201c;Nope, he hasn&#x2019;t been home all day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you know where he is?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Phin?&#x201d; The old man laughed, displaying teeth so even and white they looked false. Maybe they were. &#x201c;Well, now. He spends most of his time at his store.

A Moroccan woman is baptised in a London church. Henry VIII dispatches a Mauritanian diver to salvage lost treasures from the Mary Rose. From long-forgotten records emerge the remarkable stories of Africans who lived free in Tudor England... They were present at some of the defining moments of the age. They were christened, married and buried by the Church. They were paid wages like any other Tudors. The untold stories of the Black Tudors, dazzlingly brought to life by Kaufmann, will transform how we see this most intriguing period of history.</p><p>Miranda Kaufmann is a Senior Research Fellow at the University of London&#x2019;s Institute of Commonwealth Studies. She has appeared on Sky News, the BBC and Al Jazeera, and she&#x2019;s written for The Times, Guardian and BBC History Magazine. She lives in Pontblyddyn in North Wales.Black Tudors, by Miranda Kaufmann (Oneworld). Seeking to overturn the common assumption that there were no black communities in Britain before Caribbean immigration after the Second World War, Kaufmann presents characters such as John Blanke, a trumpeter at the court of Henry VIII, and Reasonable Blackman, a London silk weaver who lost two children in the plague of 1592. Many slaves fled Spanish or Portuguese territories in the New World, boarding ships bound for England after hearing rumors that all men there were free; one helped Sir Francis Drake recruit Africans for attacks on the Spanish. Kaufmann speculates about cultural aspects: three decades after Drake&#x2019;s ship abandoned a pregnant African woman on an island, Shakespeare created Sycorax, the mother of Caliban. (<i>The New Yorker</i>)<br><br>"&#x2018;Splendid...an excellent study of this hitherto silent minority." (<i><b><i>- Sunday Times (UK)</i></b></i>)<br><br>"The very concept of black Tudors may sound unlikely, but in this highly readable yet intensively researched book, Kaufmann, senior research fellow at the University of London&#x2019;s Institute of Commonwealth Studies, makes clear that people of African descent were residing in England centuries before the postwar Windrush generation and were not necessarily enslaved. By examining in detail the lives of 10 previously obscure men and women, Kaufmann depicts the great diversity of their experiences in 16th- and early-17th-century England. John Blanke, a trumpeter to Henry VII, lived at the Tudor court and earned twice the annual wage of a white agricultural laborer, while mariner John Anthony&#x2019;s travels took him to Virginia just as the first enslaved Africans arrived in the colony. The exotically named Cattelena of Almondsbury was an unmarried African woman who managed to make a life for herself in rural Gloucestershire. Kaufman also persuasively argues that the enslavement of Africans emerged as a response to the socioeconomic conditions of England&#x2019;s Caribbean and North American colonies, rather than as an inevitable result of a supposedly inherent racism within early modern English culture. Kaufmann&#x2019;s crucial contention, in conjunction with her lively prose and fascinating microhistories, should draw some well-deserved attention." (<i><b> - Publishers Weekly, Starred Review</b></i>)<br><br>"[The] audience will find itself in the hands of a historian of excellent investigative skills, who shows attention to detail, uses evidence with appropriate caution, and has the sensibility of a scholar." (<i><b> - Times Literary Supplement</b></i>)<br><br>"Miranda Kaufmann&#x2019;s intricately researched and brilliantly written new book pieces together fragments from the archives to reconstruct the lives of ten black Tudors. And what lives they are: a sailor, a silk weaver and a salvage diver who swam to the wreck of the Mary Rose. Then there is John Blanke, a trumpeter to the Tudor court who was witness to the coronation of Henry VIII. Through these biographies Kaufmann paints a wider panorama of a Renaissance England that was globally aware and in contact with Africa and her people. This is history on the cutting edge of archival research, but accessibly written and alive with human details and warmth. Black Tudors is a critical book that allows us to better understand an era of our national past that fascinates us like no other." (<i><b>&#x2015;David Olusoga, author of <i>Black and British: A Forgotten History</i></b></i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Tudor England&#x2019;s legendary history is a rich locus in the popular imagination. Full of pageantry and larger-than-life personalities, the period is a favorite of the Anglophilic world. But what if that seemingly monolithic world was also black? Miranda Kaufmann&#x2019;s THE BLACK TUDORS: The Untold Story combs historical records and reveals that, in fact, it was. Kaufmann looks at surviving documentation and reveals the African men and women who were present in England as full members of society, filling a variety of roles, collecting wages, and functioning autonomously. Over ten chapters, Kaufmann&#x2019;s vignettes interpret individuals&#x2019; lives within their historical moments. Yet, the historical record is not limited to Kaufmann&#x2019;s ten; appearing alongside the chapters&#x2019; main characters are others whose presence is no less fascinating for only appearing scantly in historical records. For a modern audience acculturated to thinking of Africans in the West as either enslaved or altogether absent, the picture that emerges challenges the centrality of whiteness and slavery in the Tudor period. Kaufmann takes pains to situate England on the national stage as a minor nation emerging from civil war and fighting to be acknowledged at the international level. Tudors were fascinated with North Africa and heavily invested in trading alliances and cultural exchange with African sovereigns, she reveals. Although hierarchical and heavily dependent on servants, Tudor society didn&#x2019;t have slaves, a precedent so well known that slaves of several nations schemed their way to England in a bid for freedom. Whether with Edward Swarthye, a black porter, delivering Tudor justice when he whips a white servant, or the suggestion that Anne Cobbie, the &#x201c;tawny moor with soft skin,&#x201d; might have been a literary inspiration, Kaufmann&#x2019;s THE BLACK TUDORS concentrates on individuals who are enmeshed in the historical narrative and effectively places them right back where they&#x2019;ve always belonged.&#x201d; (<i><b> - Foreword Reviews </b></i>)<br><br>"A thought-provoking account of 10 remarkable people, and a valuable corrective to some unthinking assumptions about both Tudor society and the role of racial minorities in English history." <b><i>-- Times Higher Education (UK)</i></b><br><br>"Who knew that a diver from West Africa worked to salvage Henry VIII&#x2019;s flagship the Mary Rose? Based on a wealth of original research, Miranda Kaufmann&#x2019;s <i>Black Tudors</i> restores the black presence to sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England in all its lively detail. Africans lived and worked not as slaves but as independent agents, from mariners to silk weavers, women and men, prince and prostitute. <i>Black Tudors</i> challenges assumptions about ethnic identity and racism in Tudor England. It will be required reading for anyone interested in new directions in Tudor history." (<i><b>- Dr John Cooper, Senior Lecturer in History, University of York, and author of <i>The Queen&#x2019;s Agent</i></b></i>)<br><br>"The industry and skill with which Miranda Kaufmann has hunted for these sources and teased out their meanings are exemplary... Kaufmann&#x2019;s greatest skill is her ability to fill in the background on every topic that arises, from piracy to silk-weaving to brothels to Anglo-Moroccan diplomacy...In the hands of a lesser writer this would be mere padding with secondary material, but she investigates every subject in the same depth... a fascinating book, which brings a sadly neglected part of our history to life, and grinds no ideological axes in the process. Five Stars." (<i><b><i>-- Sunday Times (UK)</i></b></i>)<br><br>"Miranda Kaufman&#x2019;s <b>The Black Tudors</b>, grounded in extensive and impeccable archival research, presents an evocative and convincing picture of the lives of real men and women of black African descent in Renaissance England. Concentrating on ten strikingly varied individuals &#x2013; from a royal trumpeter to a silk-weaver &#x2013; Kaufman persuasively argues that Africans who came to England this era were able to find a meaningful place in English society, not only in London, Southampton, and Bristol but also in rural areas. Drawing on parish records, legal cases, letters, visual images, and her broad knowledge of Tudor-era economic history and global mercantile expansion, Kaufman dispels the myth that the black Britons of this era existed only at the very upper or lower margins of society. Each of her ten individuals, who are cleverly linked to the records of many others, is vividly brought to life through a discussion of their goals, their labor, and their vicissitudes, and set within the complex social, political, economic, and religious history of the period. The book is a brilliant example of how to use the most detailed kind of archival data to present a broadly accessible picture of the past, and one which has enormous relevance to the present controversies about immigration and diversity."

Chuck and his wife, Andrea, have six children and live in North Dakota.</p>His dad was gone.<br><br>Forever.<br><br>Drew might only be twelve, but he knew the sting of his father&#x2019;s death would last a very long time&#x2014;a lifetime. The pain of loss was a fresh wound to his young, unscarred heart. There were no life calluses to impede the searing ache of death.<br><br>He sat there, staring at the casket, sorrow hanging heavy on his soul, threatening to pull him down to where he could not breathe. Though the sun darted between the clouds, trying to peek down from time to time, the day was a dark one. Long faces, black dresses, tears, tissues, and &#x201c;Taps&#x201d;&#x2014;the four loneliest notes ever played on a trumpet.<br><br>Drew tensed up when the colonel knelt down in front of him. He struggled to look the man in the eye. He had quelled his tears, letting them spill only in the privacy of his bedroom. Here, in front of military statues made of flesh and blood, he wanted to be brave for his dad. He stared at the colonel&#x2019;s whitegloved hand covering the perfectly folded flag being offered to him. His mother had asked that the flag be given to Drew, not to her. He wasn&#x2019;t sure if the gesture was for her, for Drew, or for his dad. It didn&#x2019;t matter.<br><br>He just wanted it over.<br><br>The colonel&#x2019;s deep and sober voice resonated through Drew.<br><br>&#x201c;This flag is presented on behalf of a grateful nation and the United States Army as a token of appreciation for your father&#x2019;s honorable and faithful service.&#x201d;<br><br>As Drew reached for the flag, he looked into the man&#x2019;s eyes&#x2014;and saw there the same sorrow crushing his own heart. And though he knew the words had been spoken thousands and thousands of times, Drew believed the colonel meant them.<br><br>Tears brimmed his eyes as he took the flag. He pursed his lips to restrain his hurt, but it didn&#x2019;t help. He felt his mother&#x2019;s hand on his shoulder and knew that the pain they each bore was additive in a vicious cycle that provided no escape. He leaned in to her. He had heard that time was the salve for such a wound. If that were true, Drew wished a million years could pass in an instant to separate him and his mother from the pain of his father&#x2019;s death, but instead the seconds took an eternity to pass.<br><br>The day lasted forever. Drew didn&#x2019;t want to feel the pain, but he didn&#x2019;t want to forget his father either. <br><br>So he walked through it all, painfully aware that his life was forever, irrevocably changed. <br><br>And there was nothing he could do about it.<br><br>A few days later, Drew and his mother, Kathryn, received a visit from Jake Blanchard. He had attended the funeral but was silent through its entirety.<br><br>Kathryn invited him in and offered an iced tea. The raw emotions of the week were still evident as the odd trio sat in the living room in silence. Jake held his glass with both hands, either to keep it from falling or to give his hands something to do while he worked up the courage to speak.<br><br>How ironic that a Special Forces soldier of Jake&#x2019;s caliber, with years of combat training and experience, could be reduced to a hesitant, irresolute man struggling to say a few meaningful words.<br><br>Drew had seen his mother have this effect on other men, for she was a beautiful woman, the kind of pretty that could not be diminished with dirt, sweat, or sorrow. In fact, the worse the condition, the more resolute her beauty shone in defiance. Her dark-brown hair usually fell loose across the right side of her olive-toned face. Deep-blue eyes framed by high brows and accentuated cheekbones captured the gaze of both men and women. Drew remembered how he&#x2019;d blush when his dad talked about how beautiful she was, but he was right.<br><br>As Drew looked across the room at Jake, he realized that his mother&#x2019;s beauty was not what was causing the man&#x2019;s unsettled beginning. Jake finally set the sweating glass of tea on the coffee table before him.<br><br>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, I&#x2019;m not very good with words, but I do have a few I need to speak.&#x201d; Jake dropped his gaze to the untouched tea and the ice still circling to find a resting place. His left hand massaged his right as he continued. He glanced at Drew and then back at Kathryn.<br><br>&#x201c;Ryan and I were on a lot of missions together. We became good friends. In fact, he was the best friend I&#x2019;ve ever had.&#x201d; He stopped and swallowed hard.<br><br>Kathryn teared up. &#x201c;He wrote of you, Jake.&#x201d; She spoke with a sweet compassion. &#x201c;I know Ryan considered you the same.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What I&#x2019;m sure he didn&#x2019;t tell you was that he saved my life in Iraq. I owe<br>him everything.&#x201d;<br><br>Kathryn dabbed her eyes with a Kleenex. Jake reached into his shirt pocket and removed a folded piece of paper.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he would have wanted you to have this. It was a letter he was writing as we got called on our last duty together. He gave it to me just before&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Drew&#x2019;s mother gasped, and tears streamed down her face. Jake leaned across to her, and she took the letter as though it were as precious as gold. She looked at Jake and mouthed the words <i>thank you.<br><br></i>Jake turned to Drew. &#x201c;And this is for you.&#x201d; He held out his father&#x2019;s Army Special Forces pin and green beret. &#x201c;I know he would have wanted you to have these. He was very proud of you.&#x201d;<br><br>Drew held the pin in one hand and the beret in the other. Despite all the pain that came flooding back, these things helped. They were one more connection to his dad.<br><br>Drew sniffed. &#x201c;Thank you, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Jake smiled through wet eyes and nodded. He took a deep breath, as if to prep for a mission. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean to make this difficult, ma&#x2019;am, but I need you to know one more thing before I leave. I was with Ryan at the end, and he asked me to make sure that you and Drew were taken care of.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve done that for us today. We will be all right.&#x201d;<br><br>Jake shook his head. &#x201c;I promised him, ma&#x2019;am, and I intend on keeping that promise.&#x201d; He leaned forward and handed Kathryn another paper. &#x201c;This is my address and phone number. I will be stationed here in Fort Bragg for the next six months. No matter where you are, if you need anything, call me and I<br>will be there for you and your son.&#x201d;<br><br>Kathryn took the paper. &#x201c;Thank you. That means a lot, Jake.&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded, then stood up. Drew walked with his mother to the door to see Jake out.<br><br>On the porch, Jake turned. &#x201c;It was an honor to serve with your husband, ma&#x2019;am. He was one of those rare men of true honor and integrity.&#x201d; Jake put a hand on Drew&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;You can be very proud of your father.&#x201d; <br><br>He looked as if he wanted to say something else, but instead turned and left.<br><br>When the door closed, Drew and his mother retreated to their rooms to spend time with their new treasures. Later, Drew&#x2019;s mother read the letter to him. One part stated that Drew&#x2019;s dad had some exciting news to share but that it was too important to share in a letter. He wanted to tell them in person. Whatever it was, it was news that was lost forever. Worse than that was how the<br>letter ended...<br><br>&#x201c;Please tell Drew that I miss him and that...&#x201d;<br><br>That was it.<br><br>News untold and a message undelivered. The letter hurt more than it helped, but it was worth it because it was a final memory of his dad.

But when an open-minded professor--the one adult who still believes in the Whangdoodle--joins forces with three children with active imaginations, they become an unstoppable team on a fantastic and sometimes terrifying journey to Whangdoodleland. <p> Readers who have explored Narnia, Oz, or Willy Wonka's chocolate factory will be thrilled at this new destination--a marvelous land that will inspire and stimulate creative and scientific minds. And who better to expose young readers to new ways of seeing, smelling, and hearing than Julie (Andrews) Edwards of <i>Mary Poppins</i> and <i>The Sound of Music</i> fame? Her lively and clever style pulls readers along effortlessly; she, like the professor, is one grownup who can teach children never to close their minds to possibility. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i></p><p>The Whangdoodle was once the wisest, the kindest, and the most extraordinary creature in the world. Then he disappeared and created a wonderful land for himself and all the other remarkable animals -- the ten-legged Sidewinders, the little furry Flukes, the friendly Whiffle Bird, and the treacherous, "oily" Prock. It was an almost perfect place where the last of the really great Whangdoodles could rule his kingdom with "peace, love and a sense of fun"-- apart from and forgotten by people. </p><p>But not completely forgotten. Professor Savant believed in the Whangdoodle. And when he told the three Potter children of his search for the spectacular creature, Lindy, Tom, and Ben were eager to reach Whangdoodleland. </p><p>With the Professor's help, they discovered the secret way. But waiting for them was the scheming Prock, who would use almost any means to keep them away from his beloved king. Only by skill and determination were the four travelers able to discover the last of the really great Whangdoodles and grant him his heart's desire. </p><p>Julie Andrews Edwards, star of stage and screen, has written a unique and beloved story that has become a modern classic. <em>The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles</em> is sure to continue to delight readers everywhere.

He was educated as a scholar of classical languages at Eton College and Cambridge University in England and later at Hebrew University, Israel. As a student, he was a philosopher and self-proclaimed agnostic. While in the British Medical Corps during World War II, Prince began to study the Bible as a philosophical work. Converted through a powerful encounter with Jesus Christ, he was baptized in the Holy Spirit a few days later. This life-changing experience altered the whole course of his life, which he thereafter devoted to studying and teaching the Bible as the Word of God.<br> Internationally recognized as a Bible scholar and spiritual patriarch, Derek Prince taught and ministered on six continents for more than sixty years. Until a few years before his death at the age of 88, he traveled the world, imparting God&#x2019;s revealed truth, praying for the sick and afflicted, and sharing his prophetic insights into world events in the light of Scripture. He is the author of over eighty books, six hundred audio teachings, and one hundred video teachings, many of which have been translated and published in more than one hundred languages. He pioneered teaching on such groundbreaking themes as generational curses, the biblical significance of Israel, and demonology.<br> Derek Prince Ministries, with its international headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, continues to distribute his teachings and to train missionaries, church leaders, and congregations through its worldwide national offices. It is estimated that Derek Prince&#x2019;s messages have reached more than half the globe through his books, CDs, and daily radio program, which is now known as <i>Derek Prince Legacy Radio</i>. In 2002 he said, &#x201c;It is my desire&#x2014;and I believe the Lord&#x2019;s desire&#x2014;that this ministry continue the work, which God began through me over sixty years ago, until Jesus returns.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Eleanor of Aquitaine: A Life (Ballantine Reader&#39;s Circle)</h2><p>Renowned in her time for being the most beautiful woman in Europe, the wife of two kings and mother of three, Eleanor of Aquitaine was one of the great heroines of the Middle Ages. At a time when women were regarded as little more than chattel, Eleanor managed to defy convention as she exercised power in the political sphere and crucial influence over her husbands and sons. In this beautifully written biography, Alison Weir paints a vibrant portrait of this truly exceptional woman, and provides new insights into her intimate world. Eleanor of Aquitaine lived a long life of many contrasts, of splendor and desolation, power and peril, and in this stunning narrative, Weir captures the woman&#x2014; and the queen&#x2014;in all her glory. With astonishing historic detail, mesmerizing pageantry, and irresistible accounts of royal scandal and intrigue, she recreates not only a remarkable personality but a magnificent past era.</p><p>Combining the pace and descriptive quality of a novel with the authority of a textbook, Alison Weir's study of the revered and reviled Eleanor of Aquitaine should be valuable to anyone with an interest in medieval European history. Wife of Louis VII of France and subsequently of Henry II of England, and mother of Richard "the Lion-Hearted," Eleanor played a prominent part in the politics of the 12th century. The author of a number of other books on the medieval period (<i>Life of Elizabeth I</i>, <i>The Children of Henry VIII</i>), Weir brings all the color and ever-present dangers of Eleanor's world to life, filling the text with absorbing background detail and revelatory contemporary anecdotes. She is concerned throughout to make critical analysis of the primary sources, the later myths about Eleanor, and other modern biographies. This results in a fresh and thoughtful perspective on the energetic life of a determined and ambitious woman living with the sexism, excesses, and violence of a society in which the word of a single man could condemn thousands to death. <i>Eleanor of Aquitaine</i> is a vivacious but scholarly book with extensive notes and references, giving an objective and rich account of the staunch Eleanor, her feuding family and her complex and unstable world. <i>--Karen Tiley, Amazon.co.uk</i><p>"Her biography reads like a medieval romance, a marvellous intermingling of fact with legend--fascinating-- splendid." - Literary Review</p> <br> <p>"Triumphantly done." - Sunday Times</p></p><h2>Incognegro: A Graphic Mystery (New Edition)</h2><p><b>This tenth anniversary edition of the acclaimed and fearless graphic novel features enhanced toned art, an afterword by Mat Johnson, character sketches, and other additional material.<br><br>In the early 20th Century, when lynchings were commonplace throughout the American South, a few courageous reporters from the North risked their lives to expose these atrocities. They were African-American men who, due to their light skin color, could "pass" among the white folks. They called this dangerous assignment going "incognegro."</b><br><br>Zane Pinchback, a reporter for the New York-based New Holland Herald, is sent to investigate the arrest of his own brother, charged with the brutal murder of a white woman in Mississippi. With a lynch mob already swarming, Zane must stay "incognegro" long enough to uncover the truth behind the murder in order to save his brother -- and himself. Suspenseful, unsettling and relevant, <i>Incognegro</i> is a tense graphic novel of shifting identities, forbidden passions, and secrets that run far deeper than skin color.</p><p>Mat Johnson is the author of the novels <i>Loving Day</i>, <i>Pym,</i> <i>Drop,</i> and <i>Hunting in Harlem</i>, the nonfiction novella T<i>he Great Negro Plot</i>, and the graphic novels, <i>Incognegro</i> and <i>Dark Rain</i>. He is a recipient of the United States Artist James Baldwin Fellowship, The Hurston/Wright Legacy Award, a Barnes &amp; Noble Discover Great New Writers selection, the John Dos Passos Prize for Literature, and is a Regular Contributor on NPR's <i>Fresh Air</i>. Mat Johnson is a Professor at the University of Houston Creative Writing Program.<br><br>Warren Pleece is a comic book artist mostly known for his work on DC Comics Vertigo imprint for titles such as <i>Deadenders</i>, <i>Hellblazer</i> and <i>Incognegro.</i> As well as having worked for the magazine <i>2000AD</i>, Titan comics <i>Doctor Who</i> series and for numerous publishers including Jonathan Cape, Macmillan and Simon and Shuster, he is also co-creator of comic magazine, <i>Velocity</i>, the graphic novels <i>The Great Unwashed</i>, <i>Montague Terrace</i> and the web series, <i>Alby Figgs</i>.The brows are furrowed and teeth mightily clenched in Pleece's noirish artwork for Johnson's pulpy tale of a black journalist who goes undercover in the 1930s South to investigate a possible trumped-up murder charge against his brother&#x2014;a charge that could lead to a lynching. Zane Pinchback, who is so light-skinned he can pass for white with a little cosmetic help, writes the Incognegro column for a Harlem newspaper, and his beat (like that of many a brave black journalist at the time) is the bloody circus of lynchings still claiming lives in horrendous numbers. Johnson's tale is a smart and fast-paced one, particularly when dealing with Pinchback's reluctance to return to Mississippi (wisely preferring his comparatively sheltered Harlem life). Once he's back down South, the twists and turns of the story come fast and thick, goosed by the not particularly trustworthy explanations being given by Zane's moonshine-distilling brother, and the attention-drawing antics of Zane's playboy friend Carl, who invited himself along on a lark. Johnson and Pleece have done a mostly commendable job, though the plot gets too knotted for its own good long before the conclusion, but they give a cracking Chester Himes kick to what could have been a sub&#x2013;Walter Mosley imitation.<i> (Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Hundreds of charts and illustrations simplify preserving chores and choices for everyone interested in stocking up on wholesome, natural foods.</p><p><b>Choosing Vegetable and Fruit Varieties</b><br><br>As you page through any seed catalog, you'll discover that each vegetable and fruit is usually available in a number of varieties. Some may be particularly good for freezing; others maintain their quality best when canned. Certain varieties dry better than others, and some hold their flavor and texture well in underground storage. If you're planning to preserve a good part of your harvest, you'd do well to decide how you will be storing your garden surplus before you order your seeds, and then choose those fruit and vegetable varieties accordingly.<br><br>We've made that process a little easier for you here, by listing in the charts that follow those vegetables and fruits that are generally recognized as being best for freezing; canning; drying; pickling; juicing; turning into a sauce; making jam, jelly, and preserves; and keeping in some kind of cold storage, be it in a root cellar, basement, or outdoor storage area (noted here as "good keeper").<br><br>After each variety you'll find the name of seed companies that sell that variety. If your favorite seed company is not listed, forgive us. It does not necessarily mean that the company doesn't carry the variety in question; it merely means that we have only noted the larger and more popular seed companies that we are most familiar with. We know that some small companies sell some of the same varieties, and we also know that they may offer other varieties just as good for particular storage methods.<br><br>This is the third edition of <i>Stocking Up,</i> and the third time that we have extensively revised these charts. Each time we went back to the seed catalogs we were amazed at how much had changed since the last time, which only goes to show that the seed business is far from a static one. New varieties and hybrids are being developed all the time, so keep a lookout for varieties too new to make this present chart.<br><br>Copyright � 1986 by Rodale Press, Inc.</p><h2>Blood Vow: Black Dagger Legacy</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER � J.

Whether they were literal and hid your face, or figurative to protect your soul, he was supremely comfortable with camouflage. Knowledge, after all, was power only if it gave you insight into your enemy. If insight was applied to you?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He&#x2019;d rather have a knife to his throat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And everyone was his enemy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Standing in a crowd of over a hundred sexually aroused humans, he was ready to feed his dark side&#x2014;-you know, toss some fresh meat over the chain--link fence of his sex drive and stand back as the meal was consumed, the gnawing hunger briefly satisfied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It never lasted. But that was why he&#x2019;d joined this club.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Keys was a private, members--only gig, and there were only two rules. No minors. Always with consent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After those conditions were satisfied? You could scratch the itch of whatever sin you wanted: glory holes, gang bangs, girls on girls on guys. There were rooms for fetishes, and pits for fucking, and every tie--up, chain--down, in--the--air you could ask&nbsp;for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Especially here in the Cathedral.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of all the spaces in the sprawling, multi--block compound, this was largest and the loftiest. Filled with swirls of white smoke, pierced by purple and blue lasers, empty of furniture and fixtures except for the altar, only the hardest of the hardcore were allowed in here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And masks were always worn, even on nights when the rest of the club didn&#x2019;t require it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Through the eye holes of his fitted skull plate, Axe looked up, way up, to the altar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was like a scene out of <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>, a human body suspended high above the floor, arms outstretched, head tilting to the side, swaths of fabric fanning out like wings all around the torso.

And for a split second, Axe considered materializing up there just to freak them all out, just because he could, just because he liked creating chaos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, he scaled the front of the metal framework with the ease of a spider over its web.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When he was up at the woman&#x2019;s level, her body responded in a starving arch, her head falling back, her mouth opening, her eyes begging him. She wasn&#x2019;t drugged. She was achingly aware, the scent of her sex flaring, her flesh calling out for release.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She&#x2019;d wanted him. Out of the many below, she&#x2019;d wanted him specifically.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Take me,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Take&#x2014;-&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He reached out his gloved hand and closed her mouth with his fingertips. Bending over her, he bared his canines and went for her throat. But he didn&#x2019;t bite her. He ran the tip of one fang up her jugular.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With a jerk against the chains she had volunteered for, she orgasmed for him right then and there, the alchemy of the public display, the danger he represented, the kind of sex she needed, coalescing into a release that flushed her face and made her moan as she thrashed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Down below, the pleasure she felt rippled through the teeming bodies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And he was aroused, yes. But not like they were. Not like she was.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Never as any of them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, the screaming voice in his head that told him he was a piece of shit was dimmed down by the sex. The fire of his rage against himself was doused by the distraction. The packed house of recriminations under his real skull were, momentarily, displaced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So yes, this worked for everyone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reaching up to his own throat, he released the cord of his cloak and dropped the heavy weight from his shoulders.

Although the submissions for Psych 342 had been filed electronically, Troy believed in printing them out for grading purposes&#x2014;-and after having been through midterms with the man, Elise had to agree. There was something different about holding the work in your hands and being able to write your thoughts down. It had to do with the lack of speed, she&#x2019;d decided.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Too easy to scan if you were doing things electronically, and she was such a quick typist; having to handwrite things gave her time to really think things through.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Troy sat back and stretched. &#x201c;Well, considering it&#x2019;s ten o&#x2019;clock at night only days before Christmas, I&#x2019;d say it&#x2019;s yeoman&#x2019;s duty.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As he smiled at her, she measured him. He was tall for a human, and he had bright blue eyes and the sort of face that was so open and friendly, it could make you forget that you were a stranger posing in a strange land, a foreigner who had come to visit and stayed because they were captivated by the freedom that was enjoyed by the natives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So that was my last one.&#x201d; She put the printout on her stack of graded papers on the left and twisted in the chair to crack her spine, a little sunburst of relief easing at her waist. &#x201c;You know, this was a good group of students. They really got it&#x2014;-&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he interjected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Elise frowned. &#x201c;Why? I&#x2019;m your teaching assistant. This is my job. Besides, I&#x2019;m learning even more now. . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She let her voice trail off because she was pretty sure Troy wasn&#x2019;t hearing a thing she was saying. He was looking around at the stacks that bracketed them in their alcove, his eyes not really focused.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a vampire among humans, Elise was always a little twitchy, and she hopped on the scan train, glancing about in case Troy had sensed something she had not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Foster Newmann library was a place where students went to study even though print was dead and notes were now taken on laptops and chalk no longer existed in classrooms. Four stories high, and marked by stretches of shelving that were broken up by sitting areas, the facility was a place where she always felt safe, with nothing but her studies and her ambitions before her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was when she was at home, in her father&#x2019;s mansion, that she was hunted.

Threatened.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although that was just allegorically speaking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Noticing nothing, she rubbed her eyes, the reality that she was going to have to return to that big old house making her head pound.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Seven years into her studies and she was starting to get close to her goal. Thanks to an undergrad major in psych, she had been allowed into the Psy.D. in Clinical Psychology program without a master&#x2019;s. Her goal was to go into a private counseling practice for the race when she was finally finished, specializing in PTSD.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After the raids of two years before, there were a lot of vampires suffering from traumatic loss, and so few avenues for anyone to seek social workers and counseling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, the raids had also slowed her down, too, her father insisting that she cease her studies and decamp with her aunt, uncle, and first cousin out to a safe house far from Caldwell. As soon as they had come back, however, she had gotten on track again&#x2014;-although tragedy had struck once more, making it all so much harder for her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She hated lying to her sire every night. Hated the subterfuge about where she was going and who she was with. But what other choice did she have? The small window of freedom she&#x2019;d been granted had been slammed shut.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Especially after her first cousin had been beaten to death four weeks ago.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Elise still couldn&#x2019;t believe Al-li-shon was gone, and her father, uncle, and aunt were likewise in a state of renewed shock&#x2014;-or at least, she assumed they were. No one was talking about the loss, the sadness, the anger. But they were reacting to it, for sure: Elise&#x2019;s father was so tense and grim, it was as if he were going to snap at any moment. Her aunt had been locked up in her bedroom for a month. And her uncle was a ghost who wandered around, throwing no shadows, casting no footfalls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Elise was sneaking out of the mansion to go to school. But come on. She had worked for years and years to get this far, and if anything, the way her family was handling Al-li-shon&#x2019;s loss was exactly why the race needed good, well--trained psychologists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stuffing things under the proverbial rug was a recipe for interpersonal disaster.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just tired,&#x201d; Troy said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yanking herself out of introspection, she looked at the man. Her first thought was that he was hiding something. Her second was that she had to know what it was.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Is there anything I can help with?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He shook his head. &#x201c;No, the problem&#x2019;s on my side.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As he tried to smile, she caught the scent of something in the air. Something&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I think you better go.&#x201d; He leaned down for the duffel bag he&#x2019;d brought the exams in and started shuffling stacks of papers into it. &#x201c;The roads will be getting bad because of the snow.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Troy. Can you please talk to me?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He got up, tucking his loose shirt into his khaki slacks. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all good. And I guess I won&#x2019;t see you until after New Year&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Elise frowned. &#x201c;I thought you wanted me to do the syllabus planning with you for Psych four--oh--one, two twenty--eight, and the seminar on Bipolar Two? I have tomorrow night free&#x2014;-&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s a good idea, Elise.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What the heck was that scent&#x2014;-</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh. Wow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With a flush, she realized what it was. Especially as his eyes shifted away from her: He was aroused. Because of her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was seriously, sexually aroused. And he was not happy about it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Troy.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her professor put his hand up. &#x201c;Look, it&#x2019;s nothing you&#x2019;ve done. It&#x2019;s not you, honest.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As he didn&#x2019;t go any further than that, she found herself wishing he would just come out with it all. Not because she was necessarily attracted to him, but she hated anything that was hidden. She had had more than enough of that from her family&#x2019;s perennial stiff--upper--lip way of handling life&#x2019;s inevitable unpleasantnesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Besides, it wasn&#x2019;t as if she wasn&#x2019;t attracted to him. He was appealing in an unthreatening kind of way. Smart, funny, and a heartthrob to his female students for sure. God knew she&#x2019;d seen plenty of the humans he taught stare at him like he was a god.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And maybe she had thought about what it would be like with him. The touching. The kissing. The&nbsp;. . . other things.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She had no male prospects currently and that was not going to change anytime soon. Especially given the fact that she was fouled in the eyes of the <i>glymera.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not that anyone knew that, as the male she had lain with that one time had been killed in raids.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I am of age,&#x201d; she heard herself say.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His eyes flipped to hers. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I am not young. Too young, I mean. For what&#x2019;s on your mind.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Troy&#x2019;s gaze flared as if that was the last thing he&#x2019;d expected her to say. And then he looked at her lips.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, she thought. He was safe, this human. He would never hurt her or pressure her, as that kind of aggression was not in his nature&#x2014;-and even if it was, she could easily overpower him. Besides, she was never going to be mated, would never have a life wholly outside of her father&#x2019;s control, never experience anything more than the distilled life stories in her course books.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Elise.&#x201d; He scrubbed his palm down over his face. &#x201c;Oh, God&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What? And no, I&#x2019;m not going to pretend I don&#x2019;t know what we&#x2019;re talking about here.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;There are rules. Between professors and students.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not teaching any classes of mine.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re my T.A.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I make my own decisions, no one else does.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At least that was true here, in the slice of life she had in the human world. And she would be damned if some rule in a society that was not her own was going to keep her from doing what she wanted. She got way too much of that in her species.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Troy laughed in a harsh rush. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe we&#x2019;re having this conversation. I mean, I&#x2019;ve had it in my head with you a thousand times.

Morrison has also expanded the borders of the DC Universe in the award-winning pages of SEVEN SOLDIERS, ALL-STAR SUPERMAN, FINAL CRISIS and BATMAN, INC., and he is currently reinventing the Man of Steel in the all-new ACTION COMICS.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his secret identity, Morrison is a &#x201c;counterculture&#x201d; spokesperson, a musician, an award-winning playwright and a chaos magician.

He lives in Glasgow with his wife and three children. He used to design his own hats and clothing. Currently his favorite hobby is cooking.Following Bruce Wayne's reported demise, this Grand Guignol miniseries shows the competition to fill his role. Dick Grayson, the original Robin, has established a separate crime-fighting identity as Nightwing, but now has donned the iconic cape and mask of Batman. Partnered with bratty, impatient 10-year-old Damian (son of the original Wayne), he wants to modernize Batman's equipment but maintain his high principles. Dick's successor as Robin, Jason Todd, now calls himself the Red Hood and believes that the way to reduce crime is to kill criminals as dramatically as possible. Unfortunately, the Red Hood's violent tactics bring reprisals in the form of the Flamingo, an incredibly vicious South American assassin who enjoys skinning and eating the faces of beautiful young women. Morrison's scripts use this dark material effectively, and the art&#x2014;first by Quitely, then by a team of three&#x2014;is dazzling. In this largely self-contained episode, Morrison expertly retools DC's old superhero machinery. When combined with Quitely, it nearly reaches the heights of the duo's previous <i>All-Star Superman</i>. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Occasionally he gets his hands dirty, but more often it's his sheets. <i>L.A. Dead</i> finds him in Venice, where he's about to marry the beautiful (but seriously crazy) daughter of a high-ranking Mafioso, whose other daughter happens to be married to Stone's best friend--an NYPD cop, naturally. The civil ceremony's over, but the church wedding is only hours away when Stone is called to L.A., where his former lover has just discovered her husband's dead body. The lover is Arrington (an oddity, given Stone's surname; did Woods just run out of imagination here?), the dead husband is a famous movie star, and everyone believes she killed him. Everyone except Stone, who's still in love with Arrington. He has a helluva time interviewing (and bedding) all the women in her circle, including the dead husband's private secretary, Arrington's best friend, her lawyer's mistress, and a number of Hollywood wives. Jackie Collins does the ladies better, but Stone manages to save the damsel in distress, get rid of his nutty near-wife without offending her father, and wrap up all the details except the most important one. No doubt he's saving that for the next book. In the meantime, Woods's many fans will snap this up and spend the interim wondering: if Stone marries the woman of his dreams, will that make her Arrington Barrington? <i>--Jane Adams</i>Cop-turned-lawyer-and-investigator Stone Barrington ventures out to the West Coast -- and out on a limb -- in this scintillating tale of romance and murder from the bestselling author of The Run and Worst Fears Realized.<p>No Stone Unturned...</p><p>Trouble finds Stone smack in the middle of a romantic Mediterranean holiday.

Realizing that Calculus&#39; life is in danger, Tintin and the Captain rush to warn him before it&#39;s too late.</p><p>Of Herge's many Tintin adventures, <i>The Calculus Affair</i> is generally considered the crown jewel. The intricate plot concerns Professor Calculus, who has stumbled upon an invention of devastating possibilities. Naturally the Bordurians will stop at nothing to shift the balance of power, so they kidnap the professor, sending Tintin and Captain Haddock on a dizzying chase. Also includes an extended set-piece involving a piece of sticky tape, and the first appearance by the insurance agent from hell, Jolyon Wagg. <i>--David Horiuchi</i>Herg�, one of the most famous Belgians in the world, was a comics writer and artist.

Then he met mysterious newcomer Lena Duchannes, who revealed a secret world that had been hidden in plain sight all along. A Gatlin that harbored ancient secrets beneath its moss-covered oaks and cracked sidewalks. A Gatlin where a curse has marked Lena's family of powerful Supernaturals for generations. A Gatlin where impossible, magical, life-altering events happen.<br><br>Sometimes life-ending.<br><br>Together they can face anything Gatlin throws at them, but after suffering a tragic loss, Lena starts to pull away, keeping secrets that test their relationship. And now that Ethan's eyes have been opened to the darker side of Gatlin, there's no going back. Haunted by strange visions only he can see, Ethan is pulled deeper into his town's tangled history and finds himself caught up in the dangerous network of underground passageways endlessly crisscrossing the South, where nothing is as it seems.</p><p>Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl live in Los Angeles, California, with their families. <em>Beautiful Darkness </em>is the sequel to their debut novel, <em>Beautiful Creatures</em>.Grade 7 Up&#x2014;This engrossing must-have sequel to <i>Beautiful Creatures</i> (Little, Brown, 2009) immediately returns to Gatlin, SC, and the seemingly impossible relationship between Caster girl Lena Duchannes, as yet un-Claimed for Light or Dark, and Ethan Wate, her beloved Mortal. Grieving the recent loss of Uncle Macon and worried that her 17th Moon and family curse will destroy everyone else she loves, Lena pulls away from Ethan and runs off to the Great Barrier with Siren cousin Ridley and mysterious John Breed. But is she headed for nirvana or danger? Plagued by strange visions and accompanied by his loyal friend Link and Keeper-in-Training Liv, Ethan travels the Caster Tunnels running beneath the world determined to save Lena. Along the way he faces shocking revelations about his family and gets help from several unexpected sources&#x2014;developments that will further enamor readers. Familiar and favorite characters behave just as remembered, and sometimes even better. New additions, especially clever Liv, enhance the series and its plot, which is a cycle of hope, despair, and possibility. Like her <i>Book of Moons</i>, it gives and takes with equal measure in a great storytelling balance. Mortal and Castor settings aboveground and below reinforce the novel's Southern and gothic tone. Past and present are navigated successfully, offering new information while creating more questions. With allusions to a bigger game afoot and a classic good vs. evil climax that leaves several loose ends (unique, dangerous, and entertaining), this volume will leave readers clamoring for the next installment.&#x2014;<i>Danielle Serra, Cliffside Park Public Library, NJ</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2011. &nbsp;Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.

And in the reading it lives up to every promise. It's crowded with the desperate people, always short of salvation, who are Johnson's specialty, but despite every temptation of the Vietnam dreamscape it is relentlessly sober in its attention to on-the-ground details and the gradations of psychology.

A Jedi&#x2019;s strength was fed by serenity. By distance. By loving impersonally.<br> &nbsp;<br> At least, that was the ideal&nbsp;...<br> &nbsp;<br> Weary and heart-sore, Yoda stood in silence with his fellow Master and friend Mace Windu, watching as efficient clone troopers swiftly, methodically, and not unkindly loaded the last of the slain Jedi onto repulsorlift pallets, then pushed them one-handed out of Poggle the Lesser&#x2019;s brutal arena to the Republic transport ships waiting beyond its high walls. They were supervised by those few Jedi who had survived the slaughter and the military engagement that followed it&nbsp;...&nbsp;and who were not as serenely detached as Temple philosophy might dictate.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Battle of Geonosis was over, the Separatist droid army dealt a crushing setback. But its leader Count Dooku had fled, the traitor, and his underlings from the Trade Federation, the Techno Union, the Commerce Guild, the InterGalactic Banking Clan, the Hyper-Communications Cartel, and the Corporate Alliance had fled also, to safety. Fled so they might continue to plot the downfall of the galaxy&#x2019;s great achievement, its Republic.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I do not regret coming here,&#x201d; said Mace, his dark face darkened further by shadows. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve dealt a serious blow to our enemy, and in doing so we&#x2019;ve seen what this clone army is capable of. That&#x2019;s useful. But Yoda, we have paid a heavier price than I imagined, or foresaw.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Yoda nodded, his gnarled fingers tight about his ancient gimer stick. &#x201c;The truth you speak, Master Windu. Nothing gained, there is, without some loss also to balance the scales.&#x201d; He breathed out slowly, a long, heavy sigh. &#x201c;Foolish indeed would we be, to think we might escape such a confrontation unscathed. But this loss the Temple will find difficult to overcome. Into Jedi Knighthood too soon must we thrust our oldest Padawans, I fear.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Padawans like Anakin Skywalker, so bright, so reckless&nbsp;...&nbsp;and now so hurt. On his way back to Coruscant already, with Obi-Wan and the determined, brave, and equally reckless young Senator from Naboo.<br> &nbsp;<br> Trouble for him, and for her, I sense. If only clearly could I see. But a shroud the dark side is. In smothering folds it wraps us all.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d; said Mace, frowning. Sensing his disquiet, as he always did. &#x201c;Yoda, what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Talia Moonseeker, a young Argauun only four months into her Jedi Knighthood, was kneeling beside her fallen former Master, Va&#x2019;too, head bowed. With an effort Yoda pulled his gaze away from her grief, away from the monstrous arena, still searing in the daylight. A Geonosis day lasted so long. There were yet many hours before the sun would set on this stark vista.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Answer you plainly I cannot, Master Windu,&#x201d; he replied heavily. &#x201c;Time for meditation, I require.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then you should return to the Temple,&#x201d; said Mace. &#x201c;I can oversee the cleanup operation here. You are our only beacon in the darkness, Yoda. Without your wisdom and foresight, I doubt we can prevail.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He meant the words kindly, a declaration of confidence, but Yoda felt the weight of them settle into his bones with a cruel finality.<br> &nbsp;<br> Too old am I to be the last hope of the Jedi.<br> &nbsp;<br> He watched as Talia Moonseeker withdrew to a discreet distance, so the body of her slain former Master might be decently carried from the arena by the tireless clones who had fought this day, and died this day, so utterly single-minded and fearless that he thought of droids, not men&#x2014;droids of flesh and blood, bred and drilled to be perfectly disciplined, perfectly lethal. Bred to die so the people of the Republic might live. Commissioned under the most mysterious circumstances, the truth of which might never be unraveled.<br> &nbsp;<br> Remembering the Kaminoan cloning facility, its bright white sterility, its impersonal care for the creatures it created so efficiently, so remarkably, so wholly without compunction, he repressed a shudder.<br> &nbsp;<br> Deep questions of morality and ethics do these clones raise. But answers, are there? Know that I do not. Override ethics our desperate need for them might.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mace dropped to one knee. &#x201c;Is it Dooku, Yoda? Is he what&#x2019;s troubling you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bitter pain, pricking deeply. Dooku. Yoda thrust the name, the shock, aside. There would be time later to think of that fallen man. &#x201c;To the Temple I shall now return, Master Windu. Follow me as soon as you can. Important matters there are for the Council to discuss.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Accepting the gentle rebuff, Mace stood. &#x201c;Travel safely, Yoda. I&#x2019;ll see you on Coruscant once matters here are properly concluded.&#x201d; With an abrupt snap of his fingers he summoned a nearby clone trooper. &#x201c;Master Yoda is returning to Coruscant. He requires an escort to his ship.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The trooper nodded. &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Watching the lethal asteroid belt fall away behind them, watching cruel red Geonosis smear and streak as the ship&#x2019;s hyperdrive kicked in, Yoda released the lingering grief of the recent past in another long, slow sigh. Grief was but a signifier of attachment. It had no useful purpose to serve. If he was to serve the light, as was his purpose, then must he rediscover that perfectly poised place within himself, whereupon he could stand and know he stood upon firm ground.<br> &nbsp;<br> For once he reached Coruscant, the hard work of saving the Republic would truly begin.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Jedi Temple&#x2019;s Halls of Healing were beautiful. They had lofty ceilings and enormous windows that spilled golden light over the blue and green and rose-pink walls and floor. Imbued with the Force&#x2019;s most gentle aspects, with love and nurturing and peace, they were full of perfumed flowers and green growing things, with the music of running water and the vibrancy of life renewed. They were the perfect retreat for those who were broken in body and mind, a place where the ugliness of suffering was washed away.<br> &nbsp;<br> Oblivious to the serenity around her, Padm� glared at the elderly, elegant Twi&#x2019;lek Jedi healer standing in her way. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need long, Master Vokara Che. Just a few moments. But I really do need to see Anakin Skywalker.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Twin head-tails gently twitching, the Twi&#x2019;lek clasped her hands before her. &#x201c;I am sorry, Senator Amidala, but that&#x2019;s not possible.&#x201d; Her voice had that familiar Twi&#x2019;lek huskiness, but her Basic was flawless. &#x201c;Anakin is gravely injured. He has been placed in a deep healing trance and cannot be disturbed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, I know he&#x2019;s gravely injured. I just traveled back from Geonosis with him.&#x201d; Padm� gestured at her ruined white bodysuit, heedless of the hot pain any movement caused. &#x201c;See here, Madam Jedi? This is his blood. Trust me, I know exactly how badly he&#x2019;s been hurt!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> To underscore that claim she could show the Temple&#x2019;s senior healer her crushed and bone-bruised hand, the hand Anakin had clung to as the waves of agony from his monstrous wounding burned through him without cease or mercy.<br> &nbsp;<br> But I&#x2019;d better not. He isn&#x2019;t supposed to be holding anyone&#x2019;s hand&nbsp;...&nbsp;least of all mine. It&#x2019;s bad enough that Obi-Wan was a witness.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Jedi healer shook her head. &#x201c;Senator, you are injured yourself. Let us help you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about me,&#x201d; Padm� said, impatient. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m barely scratched, and anyway, I&#x2019;m not in pain.&#x201d;<br> Vokara Che gave her a reproving look. &#x201c;Senator, do not think you can hoodwink me. I&#x2019;m not even touching you and I can feel your discomfort.&#x201d; Her head fell back and her eyes drifted closed. &#x201c;Some kind of creature attacked you, yes? And you fell from a great height. There is head pain. Your ribs are bruised. So is your spine. It&#x2019;s a wonder no bones were broken.&#x201d; The Twi&#x2019;lek&#x2019;s eyes opened, her cool gaze uncompromising. &#x201c;Shall I continue?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Aching from head to toe, the nexu&#x2019;s claw marks across her back burning, her battered ribs throbbing with every breath, Padm� gritted her teeth. &#x201c;There is nothing wrong with me that five minutes with Anakin won&#x2019;t fix. Master Vokara Che, you don&#x2019;t understand. I really must see him. Anakin&#x2019;s my bodyguard. My responsibility.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And this is my fault. I bullied him into going to Geonosis and he nearly died, so if you think I&#x2019;m abandoning him now&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Anakin Skywalker is not your responsibility,&#x201d; the Jedi healer said sharply. &#x201c;He is a Jedi and he is safely home among his fellow Jedi, who know precisely what to do for him. Please, let us treat you so you might leave the Temple in good order.&#x201d; A faint hint of censure crept into the Twi&#x2019;lek&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;Indeed, I must point out that it&#x2019;s not entirely proper for you to be here, for you to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And where else should I be?&#x201d; Padm� demanded, not caring that her raised voice was attracting the attention of three apprentice healers scurrying about their mysterious Jedi business. Not caring that she was perilously close to making a scene, behaving in a manner unbecoming to a former Queen of Naboo, a member of the Galactic Senate, a politician with a very public face.<br> &nbsp;<br> I am not leaving this place before they let me see him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Vokara Che&#x2019;s expression hardened. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re not comfortable with receiving Jedi treatment, Senator, I can see you escorted to a medcenter or&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not escorting me anywhere! I want&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Padm�,&#x201d; said a quiet voice behind her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Master Vokara Che hurried forward. &#x201c;Master Kenobi! What are you doing?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Heart thudding, Padm� turned. Obi-Wan. Still in his slashed and burned Jedi tunic. Unhealed as yet. Standing with difficulty in the doorway of a small chamber, clinging to its framework so he didn&#x2019;t fall down. His face was pale; his eyes were darkened with fatigue and pain and something else.<br> &nbsp;<br> Despair? No. It can&#x2019;t be. Jedi don&#x2019;t feel things like that. At least&nbsp;...&nbsp;not this Jedi.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Vokara Che,&#x201d; he said quietly. &#x201c;But I need a moment alone with the Senator.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s wise,&#x201d; said the Jedi healer, one hand clasping his shoulder, unrepentantly aggravated. &#x201c;You are a whisper away from collapse, Obi-Wan. I don&#x2019;t understand it; you should have been healed by now. I expressly sent&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And I sent her away,&#x201d; said Obi-Wan, apologetic. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather not be sunk in a healing trance until I&#x2019;ve seen my Padawan.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re as bad as she is.&#x201d; Vokara Che clicked her tongue. &#x201c;Very well. You have a moment.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>&nbsp;</b></p><h2>Blueprint for Revolution: How to Use Rice Pudding, Lego Men, and Other Nonviolent Techniques to Galvanize Communities, Overthrow Dictators, or Simply Change the World</h2><p><b>An urgent and accessible handbook for peaceful protesters, activists, and community organizers&#x2014;anyone trying to defend their rights, hold their government accountable, or change the world</b><br><br> <i>Blueprint for Revolution</i> will teach you how to<br> � make oppression backfire by playing your opponents&#x2019; strongest card against them<br> � identify the &#x201c;almighty pillars of power&#x201d; in order to shift the balance of control<br> � dream big, but start small: learn how to pick battles you can win<br> � listen to what people actually care about in order to incorporate their needs into your revolutionary vision<br> � master the art of compromise to bring together even the most disparate groups<br> � recognize your allies and view your enemies as potential partners<br> � use humor to make yourself heard, defuse potentially violent situations, and &#x201c;laugh your way to victory&#x201d;<br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Blueprint for Revolution</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The title is no exaggeration.

He lives in Belgrade.Chapter I<br><br>It Can Never Happen Here<br><br>My beautiful city of Belgrade probably isn&#x2019;t on your list of the top ten places to visit before you die. Some neighborhoods can be rough, and we Serbs have a reputation for being troublemakers, which is why we named a major street after Gavrilo Princip, the man accused of setting World War I in motion, and another after his band of revolutionaries. And then there&#x2019;s the memory of our former dictator Slobodan Milose&#x2c7;vic�, the maniac who introduced &#x201c;ethnic cleansing&#x201d; to the world, started four disastrous wars with his neighbors in the 1990s, and brought on a slew of NATO bombings that ravaged the city. But none of that mattered to a group of fifteen Egyptians who visited Belgrade in June 2009. That&#x2019;s because they weren&#x2019;t looking for a relaxing summer getaway. They were coming to plan a revolution.<br><br>Given their particular agenda, the first place I wanted to show them is the last place I would have recommended to any other visitor: Republic Square. To get an idea of what this dirty and misshapen part of town looks like, imagine that someone took Times Square, made it much smaller, sucked out all the energy, removed the neon, and left only the traffic and the grime. The Egyptians, however, didn&#x2019;t mind it at all&#x2014;they were hoping to bring down their own dictator, Hosni Mubarak, and for them Republic Square wasn&#x2019;t just a tourist trap but ground zero for a nonviolent movement that was started by a bunch of ordinary youngsters and grew into a massive political force that did the unthinkable and toppled Milose&#x2c7;vic�. I was part of that movement&#x2019;s leadership, and my Egyptian friends came to visit hoping that there was something they could learn from us Serbs.<br><br>I led the group to a quiet corner, far away from the bustling caf�s with their overworked waiters, and began my short talk. Once upon a time, I told them, pointing at the clusters of luxury shops&#x2014;Armani, Burberry, Max Mara&#x2014;that dotted Republic Square, Serbia&#x2019;s inflation was so bad that the price for two pounds of potatoes skyrocketed from four thousand dinars to seventeen billion in just one year. If that wasn&#x2019;t enough, we were also at war with neighboring Croatia. And if you tried to speak out against the disastrous policies that led our economy to collapse and our security to wither away, you were arrested and beaten or worse. In 1992, I was a freshman biology student, and the future for us young Serbs looked very, very bleak.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; one of the Egyptians responded with a laugh, &#x201c;we know how that feels!&#x201d;<br><br>The Egyptians continued to nod in understanding as I went on with my story. Faced with Milose&#x2c7;vic�&#x2019;s terrors, I told them, the natural response, at least at first, was apathy. After all, my friends and I were not the type of people who could even imagine one day starting a movement. We weren&#x2019;t aspiring politicians. We were college kids, and we shared the same passions as college kids all over the world: staying up late, drinking a lot, and trying to get a date. If you&#x2019;d asked me back in those days what could get me out of the house and out to Republic Square, I wouldn&#x2019;t have said a protest&#x2014;I would have said a rock concert.<br><br>From my spot on the square&#x2019;s sidelines, I tried to explain to my Egyptian friends why I loved Rimtutituki, a band whose musical-sounding name, freely translated, means &#x201c;I put a dick in you,&#x201d; hoping that the three or four women in the group who were wearing the hijab, the traditional headdress of observant Muslim women, wouldn&#x2019;t be too mortified. In 1992, the band was the coolest thing in town, a bunch of rowdy guys who played fast guitars and were known for their rowdy lyrics. When they announced a rare free concert, my friends and I all promptly skipped class and filed into Republic Square to see our idols in action.<br><br>What happened next shocked us. Rather than give another of their fun-filled performances, the members of Rimtutituki rode into the square on the top of a flatbed truck, looking more like conquering generals than punk musicians. Then, with their truck driving around in circles, they sang a selection of their best-known songs, the words making such declarations as &#x201c;If I shoot, then I won&#x2019;t have time to fuck&#x201d; and &#x201c;There is no brain under the helmet.&#x201d; You didn&#x2019;t have to be a genius to understand what was going on: with the war still raging, Belgrade was filled with soldiers and tanks en route to the front, and here were the boys in the punk band mocking all this militarism, speaking out against the war, advocating a normal and happy life. And this in a dictatorship, where spitting out such slogans in public could get you in a lot of trouble.<br><br>As I ran after the truck, cheering on my favorite musicians, I had a series of epiphanies. I understood that activism didn&#x2019;t have to be boring; in fact, it was probably more effective in the form of a cool punk show than as a stodgy demonstration. I understood that it was possible, even under the most seemingly dire conditions, to get people to care. And I understood that when enough people cared, and enough of them got together to do something about it, change was imminent. Of course, I didn&#x2019;t really understand any of these things, at least not yet. It would take me years to think through the feelings I had that afternoon in Republic Square, to make sense of my insights and convert them to actions. But once I&#x2019;d witnessed the possibility of successful and attractive nonviolent action, it was impossible to go back to my previous state of apathy. My friends and I now felt we had to do something to bring down Milose&#x2c7;vic�.<br><br>And Milose&#x2c7;vic�, to his credit, worked very hard to give us plenty of reasons to be furious. In 1996, he refused to accept the results of the parliamentary elections that would have unseated many of his goons and replaced them with members of the opposition, and when activists took to the streets to demonstrate, they were crushed by Milose&#x2c7;vic�&#x2019;s police. In 1998, Milose&#x2c7;vic� moved closer to total dictatorship, announcing that his government would now have complete control over all the affairs, academic and administrative alike, of Serbia&#x2019;s six universities. It was more than my friends and I were willing to put up with. Getting together in our small, smoky Belgrade apartments, we decided to start a movement.<br><br>We called it OTPOR, which means &#x201c;resistance,&#x201d; and we gave it a logo, a cool-looking black fist that was a riff on a potent symbol of social change that has served everyone from the partisans who fought against the Nazis in occupied Yugoslavia during World War II to the Black Panthers in the 1960s. For OTPOR&#x2019;s fist, we used a design that my best friend, Duda Petrovic, had scribbled on a scrap of paper in the hopes of impressing one of the girls from the movement. It was edgy, and it was perfect.<br><br>All this talk of logos may sound shallow, I told my Egyptian friends, but branding was important to us. Just as people all over the world see the red-and-white swoosh and instantly recognize Coca-Cola, we wanted Serbs to have a visual image they could associate with our movement. Besides, at that time we realized only too well that even if we begged all of our friends and family members to come out and support our movement, we probably couldn&#x2019;t get more than thirty people to show up at a march. We could, however, spray-paint three hundred clenched fists in one evening, and one morning early in November the citizens of Belgrade woke up to discover that Republic Square had been covered by graffiti fists. At the time, when everyone was terrified of Milose&#x2c7;vic�, this gave people the sense that something large and well-organized was lurking just beneath the surface.<br><br>And, soon enough, it was.<br><br>Seeing the fist and the word &#x201c;resistance&#x201d; plastered everywhere, young people naturally wanted to know more about this new, hip thing. They wanted to join it. To weed out the poseurs, the flakes, and, worst of all, the potential police informants, we gave them a sort of test: to prove they were serious, they themselves had to go out and spray-paint the fist in selected locations. Before too long, we had not only covered the city with our symbol but also recruited a small group of committed people who were ready to believe regime change was possible.<br><br>Once we had recruited this core group, it was time to make some crucial decisions about what kind of a movement we wanted to be. The first thing that was obvious to us was that we were going to be a strictly nonviolent movement, not only because we believed&#x2014;strongly&#x2014;in peaceful resolutions, but because trying to use force against a guy who had tens of thousands of policemen, hundreds of thousands of soldiers, and God knows how many thugs at his disposal seemed to us like a very bad idea. We could never outpunch Milose&#x2c7;vic�; but we could try to build a movement so strong and so popular that he&#x2019;d have no choice but to succumb to it, accept an open and free election, and be promptly defeated.<br><br>The other crucial decision we made was that OTPOR wouldn&#x2019;t be a movement centered on charismatic leaders. This, in part, was a practical consideration: as soon as we got big, we realized, the police would tear into us with all their might, and a movement without easily identifiable people in charge would be harder for the authorities to take down in one swoop. Arrest any one of us, went the logic, and fifteen others would take his or her place. But in order to hide in plain sight, we had to be sneaky. We needed to spark a series of small and creative confrontations with the regime. We wanted to capture that Rimtutituki moment, that special and hopeful feeling that resistance was not futile and that victory was within reach.<br><br>Pointing across to the far corner of the plaza, I asked the Egyptians to look at the squat and deserted shopping complex from the 1980s just beyond the taxi stand that was completely sheathed in black glass. That spot was where Milose&#x2c7;vic�&#x2019;s security services had arrested me on December 15, 1998. It was a freezing cold morning. OTPOR had been in existence for three months, and we&#x2019;d gathered enough supporters and enough clout to stage a small protest down the road from Republic Square. I never got there. As I made my way to the meeting point, a few police officers jumped me and dragged me off to a piss-soaked jail cell just a few minutes&#x2019; walk away, where they had their fun beating me to a pulp for what seemed like an eternity. Luckily, the thick layers of sweaters I was wearing cushioned some of the blows from their heavy boots. Eventually, the police let me go, but only after one of the cops shoved his gun into my mouth and told me he wished we were in Iraq so that he could just kill me right there.<br><br>The Egyptians perked up. This talk of beatings and guns reminded them of home, of Mubarak&#x2019;s notoriously thuggish security forces. At least we Serbs had lived through similar stuff. One of the Egyptians was an intellectual, with a slim build and wire-framed glasses. Mubarak&#x2019;s secret police had a special animosity toward students, and you could tell by the man&#x2019;s response that he must have had similar interactions with the cops. Looking directly at him, then, I continued telling the story of OTPOR&#x2019;s rise, and of how something unexpected started happening the more popular we became: the harder the police tried to scare us away from Republic Square, the more we kept coming back.<br><br>With OTPOR&#x2019;s brand stronger than ever, our little demonstrations became the hottest parties in town; if you weren&#x2019;t there, you might as well have kissed your social life goodbye. And none were cooler, naturally, than those who managed to get themselves arrested&#x2014;being hauled off to jail meant you were daring and fearless, which, of course, meant you were sexy. Within weeks, even the nerdiest kids in town, the sort who wore pocket protectors and prided themselves on bringing their own graphing calculators to school, were being shoved into police cars one evening and scoring dates with the most attractive women in their class the next.<br><br>At this point in the story, I could sense my Egyptian friends&#x2019; silent skepticism, and so I stopped and asked the bespectacled intellectual if the same dynamic was true back home. Without hesitating, he said it wasn&#x2019;t. In Cairo, he told me, speaking with authority, nobody would ever want to be on the wrong side of Mubarak&#x2019;s secret police. He had a point: even Milose&#x2c7;vic�&#x2019;s most brutal enforcer behaved like the tooth fairy compared to the guards in Mubarak&#x2019;s jails. But there was a universal principle at work in Republic Square that I wanted to share, and it really didn&#x2019;t have too much to do with whose secret police were nastier. What I wanted my Egyptian friends to understand was far more simple, and much more radical: I wanted them to understand comedy.<br><br>It&#x2019;s common for people launching nonviolent movements to cite Gandhi, say, or Martin Luther King, Jr., as their inspiration, but those guys, for all their many, many virtues, simply weren&#x2019;t that hilarious. If you&#x2019;re hoping to get a mass movement going within a very short span of time in the age of the Internet and other distractions, humor is a key strategy. And so, walking slowly through Republic Square, I told the Egyptians about how OTPOR used a lot of street theater. We didn&#x2019;t do anything too political, because politics is boring, and we wanted everything to be fun and, more important, funny. In the early days of OTPOR, I said, laughter was our greatest weapon against the regime. Milose&#x2c7;vic�&#x2019;s dictatorship, after all, was fueled by fear: fear of our neighbors, fear of surveillance, fear of the police, fear of everything. But during our time of fear, we Serbs learned that fear is best fought with laughter, and if you don&#x2019;t believe me, then try to think of the best way to reassure a friend who is about to be wheeled into an operating room for major surgery. If you act serious and concerned, his anxiety will spike. But if you crack a joke, suddenly he will relax, and maybe even smile. The same principle is true when it comes to movements.<br><br>How, then, to make something as harrowing as life under a despot funny? That&#x2019;s the best part of starting a movement. Like our heroes, Monty Python, my friends and I put our heads together and struggled to come up with good, catchy bits of activism that would have the desired effect.</p><h2>Rick Bayless Mexico One Plate At A Time</h2><p>Rick Bayless has been acclaimed widely as America's foremost proponent of Mexico's thrillingly diverse cuisine. In this companion book to his 26-part Public Television series, he takes us, with boyish enthusiasm, through Mexican markets, street stalls and home kitchens to bring us the great dishes of Mexico, one &#x201c;plate&#x201d; at a time.<br><br>Rick Bayless has been acclaimed widely as America's foremost proponent of Mexico's thrillingly diverse cuisine. In this companion book to his 26-part Public Television series, he takes us, with boyish enthusiasm, through Mexican markets, street stalls and home kitchens to bring us the great dishes of Mexico, one &#x201c;plate&#x201d; at a time. And each &#x201c;plate&#x201d; Rick presents here is a Mexican classic. Take guacamole, for instance. After teaching us the essentials for a perfect, classic guacamole, Rick shows how to spin contemporary interpretations, like his Roasted Poblano Guacamole with garlic and parsley. Rick's cuisine is always lively, but rooted in strong traditions.<br> <br>Always the teacher, Rick begins each &#x201c;plate&#x201d; with some never-before-found features: traditional benchmarks (Rick's idea of the best guacamole), when to think of the recipes (weeknight dinners or casual party food), and advice for American cooks (Rick's insight into the ingredients that make the dish). He rounds out each &#x201c;plate&#x201d; with suggestions for working ahead.<br> <br>To complete the journey into the Mexican mindset, Rick, with help from his testers, ends each &#x201c;plate&#x201d; with a question-and-answer section detailing just about everything a home cook might want to know: What are the best cuts of beef for grilled tacos? The best cheeses for quesadillas? Is one grill better than another? Rick draws from his years of living in Mexico, pulling us into the Mexican kitchen, to teach us how to create authentic Mexican dishes in our American kitchens.<br> <br>Rick is an Indiana Jones of the stove, a Julia Child of Mexican cuisine in black jeans and a T-shirt. Rick's goal: to enable folks all across the United States to create dishes that weave in the rich tapestry of Mexican flavor with ingredients that are widely available. He always provides ingredients that make the dish authentic, but he also delivers with the right substitute if an ingredient is hard to find.<br> <br>Experience food you can't wait to make in a new and user-friendly cookbook that contains the full range of dishes&#x2014;Starters, Snacks and Light Meals; Soups, Stews and Sides; Entr�es; Desserts and Drinks. Rick serves up such classic Mexican plates as Tomatillo-Braised Pork Loin, Quick-Fried Shrimp with Sweet Toasty Garlic, <i>Chiles Rellenos,</i> Cheesy <i>Enchiladas Suizas,</i> and Mexican Vanilla-Scented Flan.<br> <br>And for an exciting taste of the unexpected, try Rick's contemporary interpretations of the classics&#x2014;Crispy Potato <i>Sopes</i> with Goat Cheese and Fresh Herbs, Grilled Salmon with Lemon-and-Thyme-Scented Salsa <i>Veracruzana,</i> Broiled Flank Steak with Tomato-Poblano Salsa and Rustic <i>Cajeta</i> Apple Tarts with Berry &#x201c;Salsa.&#x201d; Food and friends, food and family. Good cooking, for Rick, is the unspoken animator of friends and family as they gather to share a meal. Rick's recipes lend themselves to weeknight family meals or celebrations. Take part in a <i>tamalada,</i> the <i>tamal</i>-making party before the party, or the ritual of a <i>barbacoa,</i> an earthy experience that Rick has made possible with a kettle grill in the backyard.<br> <br><i>24 color photographs of finished dishes Photographs of Mexican location shots throughout</i></p><p>Rick Bayless is Mexican cooking's great American voice. An award-winning chef and author of bestselling Mexican cookbooks like <i>Authentic Mexican</i>, he's found a way to present honest recipes in a friendly, relaxed fashion that nonetheless touches every technical base. <i>One Plate at a Time</i> takes his approach a step further. Bayless offers more than 120 recipes, providing traditional versions of much-loved classics like Green Chile Chicken Tamales, modern renditions of the basic repertoire, and dish "anatomies." These detail what a given dish should taste and look like, when it's best served, and how American cooks should approach its preparation. This goofproof strategy will appeal to old cooking hands and culinary gringos alike.<p> Ranging from soups and starters to entrees, light meals, desserts, and drinks, the chapters present a wide range of dishes, from the simple (such as guacamole, updated with roasted poblanos, garlic, and tomatoes) to the more complex (a classic red mole with turkey, for one, followed by Roasted Cornish Game Hens with Apricot-Pine Nut Mole). Other winning recipes include Seafood in Mojo de Ajo (with toasted, slow-cooked garlic), Smoky Chipotle Beans with Wilted Spinach and Masa "Gnocchi," and, for dessert, a definitive vanilla flan with instructions for preparing it in three versions: light, creamy, and rich. Throughout, recipes are followed by paragraph-long "postmortems" (is Mexican vanilla worth searching out, for instance) that further extend reader understanding. With 32 pages of color photos and an extensive glossary, the book is an inspired place to start or continue a Mexican cooking journey. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p><b>Rick Bayless</b> has won our country's highest chef honors (James Beard Foundation's National Chef of the Year).

The agency was so secret that it had no paper trail, and hence no written secrecy agreements. Only the verbal ones, which in Ingo's case expired several years ago. Now, in this era of burgeoning UFO "glasnost," he tells a story of meetings held in a secret underground facility not far from Washington DC, and of being taken to a remote location near the Arctic Circle to witness the expected arrival of a huge UFO over the surface of an Alaskan lake. This book discusses undeveloped human telepathy and contrasts it with the probable existence of fully developed alien telepathy, which may have many different forms. Ingo also explores the fact that we officially know far more than we're admitting about the Moon -- its origins, its atmosphere, its occupants and many other unusual features. Penetration is about one of the means by which we can learn more about those not of this earth (and vice-versa) -- telepathy. Do we have the means to answer some very important questions that many have been asking for quite a long time? Inside this book are the answers to some.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Haunting of Tram Car 015 (Dead Djinn Universe)</h2><p><p><b>P.

Scarred and hard-hearted, Dorian is one of Victorian London's wealthiest, most influential men who will stop at nothing to wreak vengeance on those who've wronged him...and will fight to the death to seize what he wants. The lovely, still innocent widow Farah Leigh Mackenzie is no exception-and soon Dorian whisks the beautiful lass away to his sanctuary in the wild Highlands...<br><b>COURTING DESIRE</b><br>But Farah is no one's puppet. She possesses a powerful secret-one that threatens her very life. When being held captive by Dorian proves to be the only way to keep Farah safe from those who would see her dead, Dorian makes Farah a scandalous proposition: marry him for protection in exchange for using her secret to help him exact revenge on his enemies. But what the Blackheart of Ben More never could have imagined is that Farah has terms of her own, igniting a tempestuous desire that consumes them both.

They have written their names inside each front cover and pored over the colorful pictures. Parents have shared Golden Moments with their children, reading such classics as The Poky Little Puppy. Thanks to the happy hours spent with the books, many children have developed a lifelong love of reading.<b>Richard Scarry</b> is one of the world's best-loved children's authors EVER! Generations of children all over the world have grown up spending hours poring over his books filled with all the colorful details of their daily lives. No other illustrator has shown such a lively interest in the words and concepts of early childhood. For himself, whenever he was asked how old he was, Scarry would always put up one hand and laugh, saying, "five!" &nbsp; Born in 1919, Richard Scarry was raised and educated in Boston, Massachusetts. After five years of drawing maps and designing graphics for the US Army, he moved to New York to pursue a career in commercial art. But after showing his portfolio to one of the original editors at Golden Books, he found the perfect home for his children's books. &nbsp; The assignments first given to Scarry tended to be Little Golden Books that featured popular characters of the day, such as Winky Dink, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and Smokey the Bear. Eventually Scarry created many original characters, such as Lowly Worm and Huckle Cat. But first came Nicholas, a young rabbit clad in red overalls, for the now-iconic board book&nbsp;<i>I Am a Bunny</i>. After Scarry married children's textbook writer Patricia Murphy, she wrote many stories for him as Patsy Scarry, including the bestselling Little Golden Books&nbsp;<i>Good Night, Little Bear</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Bunny Book</i>. In his extraordinary career, Richard Scarry illustrated more than 150 books, many of which have never been out of print. His books have sold over 100 million copies around the world and are currently published in more than 20 languages. Richard Scarry Jr., also an illustrator, carries on his father's work today under the name of Huck Scarry. Richard Scarry passed away at his home in Gstaad, Switzerland, in 1994. He was posthumously awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society of Illustrators in 2012.</p><h2>Church Discipline: How the Church Protects the Name of Jesus (9Marks: Building Healthy Churches)</h2><p><p><strong>Church discipline is essential to building a healthy church.</strong>&nbsp;So how exactly do we practice church discipline?</p><p>Jonathan Leeman helps us face the endless variety of circumstances and sins for which no scriptural case study exists, sins that don&#x2019;t show up on any list and need a biblical framework to be corrected appropriately in love.</p><p>Here is a contemporary and concise how-to guide that provides a theological framework for understanding and implementing disciplinary measures in the local church, along with several examples of real-life situations and the corresponding responses.</p></p><p><p><strong>Jonathan Leeman</strong> (PhD, University of Wales) is the editorial director for 9Marks.

He ventures into the tough area of pastoral application, which is sure to rouse good discussions, but again and again I found myself convinced. You will not fail to be helped by this book. Brief and biblical, wise and practical&#x2015;this is the book on church discipline we&#x2019;ve been looking for.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Mark Dever,</strong>&nbsp;Senior Pastor, Capitol Hill Baptist Church, Washington, DC; President, 9Marks</p><p>&#x201c;Far too few biblically grounded, pastorally sensitive books on church discipline remain in print today. I know of none that is as exegetically accurate, practically relevant, and filled with real-life case studies of how churches should deal with a wide variety of common situations. On top of all this, Leeman is helpfully succinct and remarkably clear. Highly recommended!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Craig L. Blomberg,</strong> Distinguished Professor of New Testament, Denver Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;This book is an outstanding, one-of-a-kind theological work. Leeman has shown that church discipline is an essential dimension of the disciple-making process, and thus an extension of the preaching of the gospel itself. He shows that our overly-narrow focus on the &#x2018;number of decisions&#x2019; might actually be hindering us from guiding people in the repentance that leads to life. I believe this will be the definitive work on church discipline, and our elders plan to use this work as our guide.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>J. D. Greear,</strong> President, Southern Baptist Convention; author, <em>Not God Enough</em>; Pastor, The Summit Church, Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina</p><p>&#x201c;One of the most neglected activities in the church today is the ministry of loving, courageous, and redemptive church discipline. This book provides a clear vision and practical guidelines for this vital aspect of life together in the body of Christ. I have seen many people freed from entangling sin by churches that lived out these principles, and I pray that more and more churches will recommit themselves to this restorative ministry.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Ken Sande,</strong>&nbsp;President, Relational Wisdom 360; author,&nbsp;<em>The Peacemaker</em></p><p>&#x201c;Jonathan Leeman has become a discerning reader of the contemporary church. He combines biblical truth with sage counsel in this much-needed book on church discipline. If you&#x2019;ve been afraid of that subject in your church, or unsure of how to lovingly correct sinning saints, this book provides the biblical argument and practical advice you need to get started well. This book will fire your imagination, stir your soul, and light your path.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Thabiti Anyabwile,</strong> Pastor, Anacostia River Church, Washington, DC; author, <em>What Is a Healthy Church Member?</em></p><p>&#x201c;Many different ideas enter the minds of Christians when they hear the words &#x2018;church discipline&#x2019;&#x2015;punishment, judgment, critical, unloving, excommunication. Jonathan Leeman sets the record straight by explaining what Jesus meant when he first introduced this concept of spiritual accountability. Leeman explains the purpose of church discipline and why it is necessary. The case studies illustrating situations requiring church discipline are worth the price of the book!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>J.

Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, O.P., gives us a blueprint for progress in the spiritual life. He particularly focuses on: The goal of life as supernatural life and love; The obstacles in life brought about by evil and sin; The Lords redemptive work as the source of the spiritual life; The power of mortification and acceptance of our crosses; Conformity to Christ by prayer and devotion to Mary. Permeated with rich doctrine and ideal for devotional use, this book will help those known and loved by God to know and love the same God more than ever.</p><p>Fr. Garrigou-Lagrange was a brilliant scholar who wrote over 50 books and 300 articles. He served as theological advisor to four popes, including Saint John XXIII, and also oversaw the doctoral work on Karol Wojtyla, the future Saint John Paul II. With heart and mind devoted to God, this Dominican is known for both his charity and his mastery of the theology of St. Thomas Aquinas. As one of the greatest spiritual writers of the 20th century, Fr. Garrigou-Lagrange&#39;s works continue to inspire greater knowledge and love of God.</p><h2>The Mathematical Theory of Communication</h2><p>Scientific knowledge grows at a phenomenal pace--but few books have had as lasting an impact or played as important a role in our modern world as <i>The Mathematical Theory of Communication</i>, published originally as a paper on communication theory in the <i>Bell System Technical Journal</i> more than fifty years ago. Republished in book form shortly thereafter, it has since gone through four hardcover and sixteen paperback printings. It is a revolutionary work, astounding in its foresight and contemporaneity. The University of Illinois Press is pleased and honored to issue this commemorative reprinting of a classic.</p><p><b>Claude E.

Entries include very brief descriptions of the artists and a list of their recordings, with reviews and ratings by the authors. The lengths of the CD entries vary from very short (label, catalog number, issue date, and performers) to extensive, multiparagraph descriptions of the album's history, reception, and individual songs. The authors are clearly devout jazz historians, and the character of the entries is as much admiring as it is strictly factual. Their detailed descriptions of albums, songs, and even artists' tone colors and interpretations within specific songs are testament to their expertise. They also lament the loss of jazz divisions at many major record companies, leaving independent labels to carry the lion's share of the responsibility for documenting this art form. <p>Changes from the previous edition are worth mentioning. The artist index, missing from the seventh edition, has returned in response to reader demand, but to maintain what the authors consider a reasonable physical size for the volume, they have eliminated entries "which have seemed to stand still in recent years through the lack of any new releases by the artist in question." In some particularly long entries containing extensive lists of albums, they offer an "in brief" section, which allows for the inclusion of less-important yet still worthwhile recordings by presenting shorter descriptions. </p><p>Another important feature is the "Core Collection" selections. Within the listings for some artists, recordings considered essential for a basic jazz library are printed in bold type and described in greater detail. A separate list of these 200 titles would have been useful for those who are looking to build their own collections without having to wade through the entire book to find these seminal works. </p><p>Libraries holding the seventh edition, without the author index, will probably want this one. Anything older will certainly need to be updated. <i>Steven York</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Whether we are trying to run a business, practice a vocation, raise our families, cooperate with our neighbors, or follow our religious beliefs, we run afoul of the government&#x2014;not because we are doing anything wrong but because the government has decided it knows better. When we object, that government can and does tell us, &#x201c;Try to fight this, and we&#x2019;ll ruin you.&#x201d;</p><p>In this provocative book, acclaimed social scientist and bestselling author Charles Murray shows us why we can no longer hope to roll back the power of the federal government through the normal political process. The Constitution is broken in ways that cannot be fixed even by a sympathetic Supreme Court. Our legal system is increasingly lawless, unmoored from traditional ideas of &#x201c;the rule of law.&#x201d;&nbsp;The legislative process has become systemically corrupt no matter which party is in control.</p><p>But there&#x2019;s good news beyond the Beltway. Technology is siphoning power from sclerotic government agencies and putting it in the hands of individuals and communities. The rediversification of American culture is making local freedom attractive to liberals as well as conservatives. People across the political spectrum are increasingly alienated from a regulatory state that nakedly serves its own interests rather than those of ordinary Americans.</p><p>The even better news is that federal government has a fatal weakness: It can get away with its thousands of laws and regulations only if the overwhelming majority of Americans voluntarily comply with them. Murray describes how civil disobedience backstopped by legal defense funds can make large&nbsp;portions of the 180,000-page Federal Code of Regulations unenforceable, through a targeted program that identifies regulations that arbitrarily and capriciously tell us what to do. Americans have it within their power to make the federal government an insurable hazard like hurricanes and floods, leaving us once again free to live our lives as we see fit.<br><br>By the People&#x2019;s hopeful message is that rebuilding our traditional freedoms does not require electing a right-thinking Congress or president, nor does it require five right-thinking justices on the Supreme Court. It can be done by we the people, using America&#x2019;s unique civil society to put government back in its proper box.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Charles Murray</b> is the W. H.

It is simultaneously depressing and inspiring, technical and profound, infuriating and charming, but always compelling. Charles Murray plays the role of a liberty-loving Lenin asking the question, 'What is to be done?' To this end, he offers a practical guide to repairing our broken constitutional order. It is that rarest of books: a populist manifesto grounded in fact and logic." --Jonah Goldberg<br><br>"A road map to recapture true American exceptionalism. With passion, brilliance, and a keen sense of the radical essence of what America means, Murray dismisses what passes for political debate today and offers an audacious plan to restore the liberty our founders bequeathed to us." -- Edward Crane, president emeritus, Cato Institute<br><br>"Liberty without permission? Selective civil disobedience? I'm in! At first I balked, but Murray makes a convincing case that a Madison Fund might scrape away the sclerosis of the suffocating state. As usual, his original arguments expand the way I think. When law is so complex that it's indistinguishable from lawlessness, when the tax code is 4 million words long, something like systematic disobedience is badly needed." --John Stossel</p><h2>The Great Bridge : The Epic Story of the Building of the Brooklyn Bridge</h2><p>Pages are clean.

His reign was one of the most dramatic and important of the entire Middle Ages, leading to war and conquest on an unprecedented scale, and leaving a legacy of division between the peoples of Britain that has lasted from his day to our own.<br><br>Edward I is familiar to millions as &#x2018;Longshanks&#x2019;, conqueror of Scotland and nemesis of Sir William Wallace (&#x2018;Braveheart&#x2019;). Yet this story forms only the final chapter of the king&#x2019;s astonishingly action-packed life. Earlier Edward had defeated and killed the famous Simon de Montfort in battle; travelled across Europe to the Holy Land on crusade; conquered Wales, extinguishing forever its native rulers, and constructing &#x2013; at Conwy, Harlech, Beaumaris and Caernarfon &#x2013; the most magnificent chain of castles ever created. He raised the greatest armies of the English Middle Ages, and summoned the largest parliaments; notoriously, he expelled all the Jews from his kingdom. The longest-lived of all England&#x2019;s medieval kings, he fathered no fewer than fifteen children with his first wife, Eleanor of Castile, and after her death he erected the Eleanor Crosses &#x2013; the grandest funeral monuments ever fashioned for an English monarch.<br><br>In this book, Marc Morris examines afresh the forces that drove Edward throughout his relentless career: his character, his Christian faith, and his sense of England&#x2019;s destiny &#x2013; a sense shaped in particular by the tales of the legendary King Arthur. He also explores the competing reasons that led Edward&#x2019;s opponents (including Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and Robert Bruce) to resist him, and the very different societies that then existed in Scotland, Wales and Ireland. The result is a sweeping story, immaculately researched yet compellingly told, and a vivid picture of medieval Britain at the moment when its future was decided.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>The first popular biography of Edward I in a generation by a major new historian.Marc Morris is an historian and broadcaster.

If Elmore Leonard hadn't already used it for the sequel to <i>Get Shorty</i>, it would have been a natural title for this deliciously breezy follow-up to another Leonard-to-Hollywood hit, <i>Out of Sight</i>. You may best recall Jack Foley, as played by George Clooney, bantering with Jennifer Lopez in the trunk of a jailbreak getaway car, but when <i>Out of Sight</i> ended, Foley was headed back to the clink to finish a 30-year bid. <i>Road Dogs</i> opens with Foley on the van to prison with Cundo Rey, a pint-size Cuban who soon engineers their early release--legally, this time. Jack's happy to be out and enjoying the California hospitality of Cundo and his wife Dawn (both Leonard veterans too, from <i>LaBrava</i> and <i>Riding the Rap</i>). But Dawn is lovely and wily (and maybe a psychic), Cundo is a murderously jealous husband who may well think Jack owes him big-time, and Jack? Well, when you've robbed a hundred-twenty or so banks, is it that easy to go straight? As so often with Leonard, the real fun is less in the action than the talk, especially from Foley, the pleasure-minded, level-headed hood: an ex-con whose biggest con may be that he is exactly who he says he is. <i>--Tom Nissley</i> <p> <strong>Questions for Elmore Leonard</strong> </p><p> </p><p><b>Q:Where did the inspiration for the title <i>Road Dogs</i> come from?</b> </p><p><b>A:</b> <i>Road Dogs</i> was on a list of prison expressions my researcher Gregg Sutter got for me: inmates who watch each other&#x2019;s back. I liked the sound of the words together. </p><p><b>Q: What made you decide to bring back Jack Foley, Cundo Rey, and Dawn Navarro now? What is it about these three characters that stuck with you through the years?</b> </p><p><b>A:</b> Foley was played by George Clooney in <i>Out of Sight</i>. I imagined George in the scenes I wrote and it worked. Dawn Navarro was the psychic in <i>Riding the Rap</i>, a supporting character ready for a leading role. Cundo Rey from <i>LaBrava</i>, another favorite of mine, also deserved a bigger role, so I brought him back.. </p><p><b>Q: Any chance Foley and the woman he loves, Federal Marshal Karen Sisco, will be back in the near future?</b> </p><p><b>A:</b> I&#x2019;m not sure Foley is up to robbing another bank. But Karen Sisco, the federal marshal in <i>Out of Sight</i>, could show up again; maybe working for her dad, a private investigator. </p><p><b>Q: One of the hallmarks of your writing is your gift for the telling detail. When Foley is offering Cundo Rey&#x2019;s money man, Jimmy, some advice about his skimming, he tells him that Cundo won&#x2019;t kill him, but he might &#x201c;break your legs with a Jos� Canseco bat.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s one of those small yet wonderfully deft touches that adds color without slowing the pace.

It is bent on revenge for a crime committed against the devotees of an ancient religion. At large in London, it pursues its victims without mercy and no one, it seems, is safe from its gruesome clutches. Richard Marsh's weird, compelling and highly original novel, which once outsold Dracula, is both a horror masterpiece and a fin de siecle melodrama embracing the fears and concerns of late Victorian society.

She is a featured artist in Lark Books' Masters: Beadweaving 9781600590399, has authored ten books and written numerous magazine articles. Diane is the 2008 recipient of the Bead &amp; Button Show Excellence in Bead Artistry Award and was voted one of the top five beading teachers by readers of Beadwork magazine.This master jeweler and multibook author spent much time&nbsp;and care figuring out the construction of shaped beads&#x2014;the two- and the three-dimensional kinds. That means that, thanks to her patience and creativity, handmade beads now can resemble high-end dimensional necklaces and bracelets from designer brands. More intricate than the traditional craft, shaped beadwork begins with a mastery of the peyote stitch, a technique that weaves the thread into a bead twice to create an unbroken surface, then proceeds to making&nbsp;flat geometric shapes (triangle, square, and oval, for instance); open shapes (that is,&nbsp;with &#x201c;holes&#x201d; inside); and finally to cubes, tetras, and dodecas (12 pentagons). Although the majority of the book is devoted to the actual fashioning of these bead shapes, Fitzgerald adds her personal inspiration by way of a dozen-plus items to make, including a Celtic trefoil, Berber earrings, and a&nbsp;trillium necklace. A true breakthrough in the art of beadwork. --Barbara Jacobs</p><h2>Obedience to Authority (Perennial Classics)</h2><p><p>In the 1960s Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram famously carried out a series of experiments that forever changed our perceptions of morality and free will.

Yet he was a haunted man, and much of his brief<br>time with the band, before his death in 1969 at the infamous age of twenty-seven, was volatile and tragic. Some of the details of how Jones was dethroned are well<br>known, but the full story of his downfall is still largely untold.<br><br><i>Brian Jones</i> is a forensic, thrilling account of Jones&#x2019;s life, which for the first time details his pioneering achievements and messy unraveling. With more than 120 new interviews, Trynka offers countless new revelations and sets straight the tall tales that have long marred Jones&#x2019;s legacy. His story is a gripping battle between<br>creativity and ambition, between self-sabotage and betrayal. It&#x2019;s all here: the girlfriends, the drugs, and some of the greatest music of all time.<br><br>Victors get to write history&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s rarely fully true. The complete, magnificent story of the Rolling Stones can never be told until we disentangle all the threads and put Brian Jones back in the foreground.</p><p><b>Paul Trynka</b> is a respected music writer known both for his groundbreaking role as editor of <i>MOJO</i> magazine and as author of <i>Starman</i> and <i>Open Up and Bleed, </i>biographies of David Bowie and Iggy Pop, respectively, which attracted laudatory reviews worldwide. <i>Portrait of the Blues</i>, his collection of oral histories with more than sixty blues musicians (in collaboration with photographer Val Wilmer), is regarded as a landmark work. Paul was also editor of the widely respected <i>International Musician</i> magazine and founding editor of the<i> Guitar Magazine</i>, for which he first interviewed Keith Richards more than twenty years ago. Paul lives with his wife, Lucy, and son, Curtis, in Greenwich, London, just down the road from Mick and Keith&#x2019;s old stomping ground of Dartford.<p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>IT WAS ONLY a raggle-taggle bunch of musicians, kids really, and the way history normally unfolds, there should have been no way any witnesses would have spotted that something world-changing was happening. Yet, the leader of the band did have something special about him &#x2013; the way he sneered at the audience, getting in their faces, coaxing out shimmering glissandos from his guitar in a style no one had ever seen before, or switching over to an amplified blues harp, still a radically new instrument for most of the teenagers who watched him and his companions intently. Elmo Lewis, as he called himself, introduced several of the numbers and ministered to the rest of his band lovingly, like a mother hen, checking that the singer Mick had got the beat, and keeping a close eye on his fellow guitarist&#x2019;s fretboard. Occasionally, when the riffs cohered into something stirring and electrifying, he and the piano player &#x2013; the other more obviously experienced musician &#x2013; would look at each other and smile in satisfaction.</p><p>Truth is, though, that some people in that decent-sized crowd watching the Rolling Stones, crammed on to the Marquee stage, in July 1962 &#x2013; and some among those at other little clubs around London over the next few weeks &#x2013; did spot that something unique was happening. One girl felt the ground beneath her shifting as the band ripped through twenty songs, picked out and overseen by the blond guitarist. At her London grammar school, Cleo Sylvestre had been taught that the role of black people in culture was as &#x2018;heathens and savages&#x2019;. Now, as the band hot-wired this obscure music from deep within the black ghettos of the Chicago Southside and the Mississippi Delta, a new world opened up &#x2013; a world in which black people like her would have a voice, a role.</p><p>Some musicians spotted it, too. Ginger Baker, an aggressive young drummer who had cut his teeth in the trad jazz clubs and was being persuaded into the blues scene by the silver-tongued club owner Alexis Korner, was dismissive of the Stones&#x2019; upstart singer. Yet still he reckoned that the band&#x2019;s exuberant, snotty, teenage take on this deep, resonant music was something radical and new.</p><p>Businessmen got it. Harold Pendleton, manager of the Marquee and a mainstay of the jazz scene, was likewise unimpressed by the band&#x2019;s music yet still noted something powerful about their attitude &#x2013; a challenging of authority, a disregard for convention that emanated principally from Brian Jones, the twenty-one-year-old who styled himself Elmo Lewis. Jones was a visionary, Pendleton reckoned, although there was something he didn&#x2019;t like about him. He used the term &#x2018;evil genius&#x2019;.</p><p>As for Brian himself, the momentary satisfaction he felt as the band he&#x2019;d masterminded took to the stage was itself world-changing. The music was the one thing that gave meaning to a life that was fractured, restless and unhappy. Now, over fifty years on, that situation endures. Brian Jones got many things wrong in his life, but the most important thing he got right, for his music was world-changing.</p><p>History is written by the victors, and in recent years we&#x2019;ve seen the proprietors of the modern Rolling Stones describe their genesis, their discovery of the blues, without even mentioning their founder. We&#x2019;ve seen Brian Jones described as a &#x2018;kind of rotting attachment&#x2019;. This phrase in itself gives an idea of the magnitude of this story. The dark power of the Stones&#x2019; music derives from their internal battles, a sequence of betrayals, back-biting, sexual oneupmanship, violence, madness and mania.</p><p>The aim of this book is not to gloss over the many flaws of Brian Jones, for if ever a man was driven by his flaws, it was he. His contrariness, his vulnerability and his unhappiness prompted his estrangement from the establishment, and ultimately would underpin the values of the band, which challenged that establishment so provocatively. There was a darkness in his heart that inspired his exploration of the Devil&#x2019;s music, of the story of Robert Johnson, the man who traded the secrets of guitar playing for his immortal soul. Brian sought out those secrets, and was the first man to communicate them to a new generation. It was he who opened the doors to that new world, unlocking its secrets both for his bandmates and for us.</p><p>In the course of writing this book I&#x2019;ve travelled far, and plumbed deep. It&#x2019;s a sad story &#x2013; of messy lives, unwanted children, ruthlessness and misogyny, of feuds both petty and profound. But great art can come from messy situations. As we shall see, right from the start there was something of the Devil in Brian Jones. And as we know, the Devil has the best tunes.</p><p></p><p></p><p>NEW WORLDS ARE often dreamed up in the most mundane locations. Few people would have imagined the genteel, manicured spa town of Cheltenham as a cradle for a radical new musical manifesto. But the place turns out to be funny that way, countless secrets having been harboured behind those deceptively staid facades. Brian Jones was in fact a typical Cheltonian. By the time he left the place he&#x2019;d discovered more musical secrets than were ever supposed to exist, as well as amassing more secret children, and heartbreak, than can ever have been imagined.</p><p>The word &#x2018;genteel&#x2019; seems to get applied to Cheltenham with monotonous regularity. And yes, perhaps it is an appropriate adjective, as long as you bundle in alongside it the following words: secretive, exotic, futuristic, sordid, elegant, decadent and artistic. Nearly all of those terms capture the early life of Lewis Brian Hopkins Jones, a boy whose destiny seemed more than any other dictated by his surroundings and upbringing. He was the son of an ambitious man who worked at the cutting edge of a world-changing technology. Lewis Blount Jones was, like the son who carried his name, a genius; yet his life was defined by secrets, repression and the traditional British stiff upper lip. This legacy would also define the life of Lewis Jones Jr, for better and for worse.</p><p>Any visitor who&#x2019;s new to the town would be instantly struck by the serene beauty of its gleaming white Regency buildings. A long, wide promenade runs south from the high street (location of Brian&#x2019;s grammar school) down to a group of buildings around Lansdown Crescent and Montpellier Walk, all airy shops and coffee bars, framed by caryatids &#x2013; pillars in the shape of serene women, like those of the Acropolis. Over the road lie the fine green lawns of Imperial Gardens, with the Queens Hotel just in front; a little further down is the Pump Room, another jewel of Georgian architecture, based on the Pantheon; Regency terraces stretch in every direction, the very model of taste and discretion. But as Barry Miles, founder of counter-culture journal <i>International Times</i> and the Indica Gallery, who fled Cheltenham in 1962, points out, &#x2018;it&#x2019;s all a facade&#x2019;. The elegant stone frontages of many buildings are in fact cheap painted stucco; the interiors are rickety and damp, thrown up quickly by speculative builders. With its exclusive Ladies&#x2019; College, arts and music festivals, and well-heeled populace, many of them ex-colonials, post-war Cheltenham was indeed a centre of decorum and conservatism. But behind that lay a hotbed of intrigue and vice.</p><p>This secretive character became more formal, more acknowledged, from the early fifties, when Cheltenham became the capital for the nation&#x2019;s spooks after GCHQ, the centre of the British eavesdropping and intelligence community, moved from Bletchley to two government-owned sites in the town. Modern apartment buildings started to spring up and then to fill with mysterious people, many of them European and multilingual; sometimes, if you spotted them drinking at the town&#x2019;s exclusive wine bars, you&#x2019;d glimpse a security pass.</p><p>The James Bond vibe was intensified by the Gloster Aircraft Company, builders of Britain&#x2019;s first operational jet fighter, the Meteor: its top-secret prototypes were assembled at a building on Cheltenham High Street. By the mid fifties Gloster were producing the Javelin, a glossily futuristic delta-wing interceptor. Gloster and Rotol, a part-owned subsidiary of Rolls-Royce launched as a joint venture with the Bristol Aeroplane Company, were the town&#x2019;s leading employers, drawing scientists and engineers like Brian Jones&#x2019;s father from around the country.</p><p>Alongside the world&#x2019;s modern secretive industries, Cheltenham was a centre of the world&#x2019;s oldest secretive industry. The town hosted several US Air Force bases, and the presence of US and British military personnel encouraged a bounteous supply of prostitutes: according to one count, those elegant Regency facades hid a total of forty-seven brothels. Right up to the 1960s, Bayshill Road, two blocks down from the Promenade, was a haunt for streetwalkers, who&#x2019;d cheekily ask any passing men if they were &#x2018;looking for business&#x2019;. The Queens Hotel dominated the town&#x2019;s main drag and became a regular haunt for the teenage Brian Jones, all shirt and tie, formal and correct. Yet during the Cheltenham Festival horse-racing week the old colonial types were cleared out to make way for hard-core gamblers and intimidating Irish gangster types who&#x2019;d play cards until dawn surrounded by high-class call girls who regarded the festival as a cornerstone of the year&#x2019;s working calendar. Even the political establishment had its louche side: the town&#x2019;s most popular mayor, Charles Irving, who became a favourite of Tory icon Margaret Thatcher, drove around town in a white Ford Thunderbird alongside a chauffeur who was dressed in mauve &#x2013; a spectacle &#x2018;so gay it was unbelievable&#x2019;, say witnesses.</p><p>Perhaps the best evidence of Cheltenham&#x2019;s Jekyll and Hyde character can be found in the pages of the refined, stately daily newspaper the <i>Gloucestershire Echo</i>. The <i>Echo</i> majored on issues military and religious, its attitude proudly High Church of England. Its readers were often subject to shocked homilies berating the town&#x2019;s lax morality. In 1956, the Reverend Ward bemoaned &#x2018;some innate tendency, a particular evil, that is more marked in Cheltenham than in most places in this country&#x2019;, namely the town&#x2019;s rate of illegitimate births &#x2013; the highest in the country outside London&#x2019;s inner city. Concerned burghers commissioned further research to establish whether Americans or Irish were responsible for this appalling statistic; the figures revealed it was the English. In later years, Brian&#x2019;s fellow Stones wondered how someone so sexually voracious could have come from a town like Cheltenham. Little did they realize that he was Cheltonian through and through.</p><p>Lewis Blount Jones, a talented graduate in engineering from Leeds University, scored a prestigious job at Rotol in 1939, and soon after that married Louisa Simmonds. The couple set up home on Eldorado Road, in a somewhat gloomy red-brick house near the town centre. This was where the young Lewis Brian Hopkins Jones, born in Cheltenham&#x2019;s Park Nursing Home on 28 February 1942, grew up. Brian was soon joined by a sister, Pamela, who was born on 3 October 1943. Just over two years later, on 14 October 1945, the family was touched by tragedy when Pamela died of leukaemia. Lewis and Louisa never spoke about their child&#x2019;s death &#x2013; it became another of Cheltenham&#x2019;s secrets. The following summer, on 22 August, another sister for Brian was born &#x2013; Barbara, who would always resemble him.</p><p>Around 1950, the family moved to Hatherley Road, in what we&#x2019;d describe today as quintessential suburbia. In the austerity of the immediate post-war years a new home in a leafy location, complete with garage and modern kitchen, was a badge of high status. &#x2018;It was a prestigious place,&#x2019; remembers next-door neighbour Roger Jessop. &#x2018;Those houses were built as special one-offs, much sought after, and the people in our area were eminently middle class. And of all of them, Lewis Jones was about as middle class as you could get.&#x2019;</p><p>Lewis Jones would become a symbol of the Generation Gap &#x2013; the fault line that opened up when boys like Brian Jones reached adolescence. Brian&#x2019;s life was lived in flagrant opposition to the values of his father, who was repressed and domineering, and who never, ever used the word &#x2018;love&#x2019;. Yet Lewis was anything but an old fogey. Just as Brian became the embodiment of a cultural revolution, Lewis was the embodiment of a technological revolution: his duties at Rotol included work on the most advanced propellors and turbines of the day. Not only did he own a desirable suburban residence, Lewis also owned a car and a phone, both of them rare possessions in the early fifties, and was typical of the new wave of modern British engineers who&#x2019;d led the world in the development of radar, the jet engine and military electronics. &#x2018;He was far-sighted, concerned about the future of British engineering, and would write well-argued letters to the newspapers suggesting it should be given higher priority,&#x2019; says Roger Jessop.</p><p>The young Keith Richards witnessed Hurricanes and Spitfires chasing lone Dorniers out of Kent &#x2013; there&#x2019;s a good chance their propellors were made by Rotol, as were vital engine parts for Britain&#x2019;s pioneering jets. Like GCHQ and the Dowty company (with which Rotol later merged), Rotol was a prestigious Cheltonian workplace. Lewis commanded huge respect and eventually became head of the crucial airworthiness department. &#x2018;He was a learned gentleman,&#x2019; says colleague Robert Almond, &#x2018;formal, as people were in those days.&#x2019; Linda Partridge, another Dowty Rotol worker, calls him &#x2018;delightful; a very nice, gentle sort of man&#x2019;. Linda&#x2019;s brothers knew Brian well, and thought Lewis and his son were pretty similar, in looks and size &#x2013; small feet, delicate musician&#x2019;s hands, modest height &#x2013; and a certain shyness.</p><p>Louisa Simmonds had met Lewis in South Wales and shared with her husband a Welsh &#x2018;chapel&#x2019; background: both were brought up in the traditions of the Welsh Methodist Church. Most surviving accounts of her come from Brian&#x2019;s teenage girlfriends, like Pat Andrews, who remember Louisa&#x2019;s household as &#x2018;a morgue&#x2019;, gloomy and oppressive &#x2013; but by this time, of course, Brian&#x2019;s wilful behaviour was already causing crippling tension in the Jones family.</p><p>Back in the 1950s, though, Louisa &#x2013; a slim, neatly dressed woman with practical mid-length hair &#x2013; was well known in Cheltenham middle-class circles. She and her husband were social in that earnest, self-improving, almost Victorian way. The couple were proud of their Welsh roots and were key members of the local Cymmrodorion group, which organized talks on Welsh literature and history. The Welsh Church, says family friend Graham Keen, had a strong presence in Cheltenham: &#x2018;there was a lot of Welsh economic migration from 1917, after the coal bust&#x2019;. Graham&#x2019;s parents, Marian and Arthur, knew the Joneses well from Welsh and musical circles, and shared the same ethos of self-improvement, with one crucial difference. &#x2018;The chapel beliefs were that you didn&#x2019;t drink, you didn&#x2019;t smoke,&#x2019; Graham explains. &#x2018;But there was a certain flexibility &#x2013; it was mixed with common sense.&#x2019; Graham&#x2019;s dad Arthur enjoyed a drink without believing it would condemn him to Hell, but the Keens reckoned the Joneses&#x2019; attitude was &#x2018;fairly fundamental&#x2019;.</p><p>Louisa boasted one undeniably positive character trait: her enthusiasm for music.

Was he the same one who&#x2019;d been glancing at you on the subway?<br> <br>Or a dark dot moving toward your bed but now vanished. A black widow spider?<br> <br>But then her visitor, sitting on her living room couch, glanced at her and smiled and Alice Sanderson forgot the concern&#x2014;if concern it was. Arthur had a good mind and a solid body, sure. But he had a great smile, which counted for a lot more.<br> <br>&#x201c;How &#x2019;bout some wine?&#x201d; she asked, walking into her small kitchen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure. Whatever you&#x2019;ve got.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So, this&#x2019;s pretty fun&#x2014;playing hooky on a weekday. Two grown adults. I like it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Born to be wild,&#x201d; he joked.<br> <br>Outside the window, across the street, were rows of painted and natural brownstones. They could also see part of the Manhattan skyline, hazy on this pleasant spring weekday. Air&#x2014;fresh enough for the city&#x2014;wafted in, carrying the scents of garlic and oregano from an Italian restaurant up the street. It was their favorite type of cuisine&#x2014;one of the many common interests they&#x2019;d discovered since they&#x2019;d met several weeks ago at a wine tasting in SoHo. In late April, Alice had found herself in the crowd of about forty, listening to a sommelier lecture about the wines of Europe, when she&#x2019;d heard a man&#x2019;s voice ask about a particular type of Spanish red wine.<br> <br>She had barked a quiet laugh. She happened to own a case of that very wine (well, part of a case now). It was made by a little-known vineyard. Perhaps not the best Rioja ever produced but the wine offered another bouquet: that of fond memory. She and a French lover had consumed plenty of it during a week in Spain&#x2014;a perfect liaison, just the thing for a woman in her late twenties who&#x2019;d recently broken up with her boyfriend. The vacation fling was passionate, intense and, of course, doomed, which made it all the better.<br> <br>Alice had leaned forward to see who&#x2019;d mentioned the wine: a nondescript man in a business suit. After a few glasses of the featured selections she&#x2019;d grown braver and, juggling a plate of finger food, had made her way across the room and asked him about his interest in the wine.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d explained about a trip he&#x2019;d taken to Spain a few years ago with an ex-girlfriend. How he&#x2019;d come to enjoy the wine. They&#x2019;d sat at a table and talked for some time. Arthur, it seemed, liked the same food she did, the same sports. They both jogged and spent an hour each morning in overpriced health clubs. &#x201c;But,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I wear the cheapest JCPenney shorts and T-shirts I can find. No designer garbage for me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Then he&#x2019;d blushed, realizing he&#x2019;d possibly insulted her.<br> <br>But she&#x2019;d laughed. She took the same approach to workout clothes (in her case, bought at Target when visiting her family in Jersey). She&#x2019;d quashed the urge to tell him this, though, worried about coming on too strong. They&#x2019;d played that popular urban dating game: what we have in common. They&#x2019;d rated restaurants, compared Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes and complained about their shrinks.<br> <br>A date ensued, then another. Art was funny and courteous. A little stiff, shy at times, reclusive, which she put down to what he described as the breakup from hell&#x2014;a long-term girlfriend in the fashion business. And his grueling work schedule&#x2014;he was a Manhattan businessman. He had little free time.<br> <br>Would anything come of it?<br> <br>He wasn&#x2019;t a boyfriend yet. But there were far worse people to spend time with. And when they&#x2019;d kissed on their most recent date, she&#x2019;d felt the low ping that meant, oh, yeah: chemistry. Tonight might or might not reveal exactly how much. She&#x2019;d noticed that Arthur had furtively&#x2014;he thought&#x2014;been checking out the tight pink little number she&#x2019;d bought at Bergdorf&#x2019;s especially for their date. And Alice had made some preparations in the bedroom in case kissing turned into something else.<br> <br>Then the faint uneasiness, the concern about the spider, returned.<br> <br>What was bothering her?<br> <br>Alice supposed it was nothing more than a residue of unpleasantness she&#x2019;d experienced when a deliveryman had dropped off a package earlier. Shaved head and bushy eyebrows, smelling of cigarette smoke and speaking in a thick Eastern European accent. As she&#x2019;d signed the papers, he&#x2019;d looked her over&#x2014;clearly flirting&#x2014;and then asked for a glass of water. She brought it to him reluctantly and found him in the middle of her living room, staring at her sound system.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d told him she was expecting company and he&#x2019;d left, frowning, as if angry over a snub. Alice had watched out the window and noted that nearly ten minutes had passed before he got into the double-parked van and left.<br> <br>What had he been doing in the apartment building all that time? Checking out&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Earth to Alice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; She laughed, continued to the couch, then sat next to Arthur, their knees brushing. Thoughts of the deliveryman vanished. They touched glasses, these two people who were compatible in all-important areas&#x2014;politics (they contributed virtually the same amount to the Dems and gave money during NPR pledge drives), movies, food, traveling. They were both lapsed Protestants.<br> <br>When their knees touched again, his rubbed seductively. Then Arthur smiled and asked, &#x201c;Oh, that painting you bought, the Prescott? Did you get it?&#x201d;<br> <br>Her eyes shone as she nodded. &#x201c;Yep. I now own a Harvey Prescott.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alice Sanderson was not a wealthy woman by Manhattan standards but she&#x2019;d invested well and indulged her true passion. She&#x2019;d followed the career of Prescott, a painter from Oregon who specialized in photorealistic works of families&#x2014;not existing people but ones he himself made up. Some traditional, some not so&#x2014;single parent, mixed race or gay. Virtually none of his paintings were on the market in her price range but she was on the mailing lists of the galleries that occasionally sold his work. Last month she&#x2019;d learned from one out west that a small early canvas might be coming available for $150,000. Sure enough, the owner decided to sell and she&#x2019;d dipped into her investment account to come up with the cash.<br> <br>That was the delivery she&#x2019;d received today. But the pleasure of owning the piece now diminished again with a flare-up of concern about the driver. She recalled his smell, his lascivious eyes. Alice rose, on the pretense of opening the curtains wider, and looked outside. No delivery trucks, no skinheads standing on the street corner and staring up at her apartment. She thought about closing and locking the window, but that seemed too paranoid and would require an explanation.<br> <br>She returned to Arthur, glanced at her walls and told him she wasn&#x2019;t sure where to hang the painting in her small apartment. A brief fantasy played out: Arthur&#x2019;s staying over one Saturday night and on Sunday, after brunch, helping her find the perfect place for the canvas.<br> <br>Her voice was filled with pleasure and pride as she said, &#x201c;You want to see it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You bet.&#x201d;<br> <br>They rose and she walked toward the bedroom, believing that she heard footsteps in the corridor outside. All the other tenants should have been at work, this time of day.<br> <br>Could it be the deliveryman?<br> <br>Well, at least she wasn&#x2019;t alone.<br> <br>They got to the bedroom door.<br> <br>Which was when the black widow struck.<br> <br>With a jolt Alice now understood what had been bothering her, and it had nothing to do with the deliveryman. No, it was about Arthur. When they&#x2019;d spoken yesterday he&#x2019;d asked when the Prescott would be arriving.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d told him she was getting a painting but had never mentioned the artist&#x2019;s name. Slowing now, at the bedroom door. Her hands were sweating. If he&#x2019;d learned of the painting without her telling him, then maybe he&#x2019;d found other facts about her life. What if all of the many things they had in common were lies? What if he&#x2019;d known about her love of the Spanish wine ahead of time? What if he&#x2019;d been at the tasting just to get close to her? All the restaurants they knew, the travel, the TV shows&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>My God, here she was leading a man she&#x2019;d known for only a few weeks into her bedroom. All her defenses down&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Breathing hard now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Shivering.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, the painting,&#x201d; he whispered, looking past her. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s beautiful.&#x201d;<br> <br>And, hearing his calm, pleasant voice, Alice laughed to herself. Are you crazy? She must have mentioned Prescott&#x2019;s name to Arthur. She tucked the uneasiness away. Calm down. You&#x2019;ve been living alone too long. Remember his smiles, his joking. He thinks the way you think.<br> <br>Relax.<br> <br>A faint laugh. Alice stared at the two-by-two-foot canvas, the muted colors, a half dozen people at a dinner table looking out, some amused, some pensive, some troubled.<br> <br>&#x201c;Incredible,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;The composition is wonderful but it&#x2019;s their expressions that he captures so perfectly. Don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d; Alice turned to him.<br> <br>Her smile vanished. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that, Arthur? What are you doing?&#x201d; He&#x2019;d put on beige cloth gloves and was reaching into his pocket. And then she looked into his eyes, which had hardened into dark pinpricks beneath furrowed brows, in a face she hardly recognized at all.</p><h2>The Joy of Work: Dilbert&#39;s Guide to Finding Happiness at the Expense of Your Co-Workers</h2><p><blockquote>"I cried because I did not have an office with a door, until I met a man who had no cubicle." <br>-- Dilbert </blockquote> <p> A message from Scott Adams: </p><p> I think the next wave of office design will focus on eliminating the only remaining obstacle to office productivity: your happiness. Happiness isn't a physical thing, like walls and doors. But it's closely related. Managers know that if they can eliminate all traces of happiness, the employees won't be so picky about their physical surroundings. Once you're hopelessly unhappy, you won't bother to complain if your boss rolls you up in a tight ball and crams you into a cardboard box. </p><p> As soon as I noticed this disturbing threat to workplace happiness, I did some investigative work and discovered it wasn't confined to the issue of office design. Companies were making a direct frontal assault on employee happiness in every possible way! I knew there was only one thing that could stop the horror. </p><p> It was time for another Dilbert book. </p><p> It might sound corny, but I felt an obligation to society. People told me it was time for me to "give something back to the community." This scared me, until I realized that no one knows I furnished my house with street signs and park benches. So I interpreted the "give something back to the community" message as a plea for me to write this book and then charge the community to read it. </p><p>In the first part of this book I will tell you how to find happiness at the expense of your co-workers, managers, customers, and--best of all--those lazy stockholders. The second part of the book teaches you my top-secret methods for mining humor out of ordinary situations, thus making it easier to mock the people around you. The third part of the book is made entirely of invisible pages. If the book seems heavier than it looks, that's why. </p><p> Office Prank #44: Sounds That Drive Co-workers Crazy </p><p> You can produce sounds in the office that will drive your co-workers insane. That can be very entertaining. Every co-worker is different, so you might have to experiment to find the sounds that are most annoying to your cubicle neighbor. It's worth the effort.</p></p><p>Scott Adams's latest work is <i>not</i> a collection of Dilbert cartoons (though recycled strips are liberally sprinkled throughout); it's a dialogue between the man and his fans disguised as a tongue-in-cheek guide to surviving the corporate life. There are chapters on "Office Pranks," "Surviving Meetings," and "Managing Your Co-Workers," with enough weird stories and practical jokes to make any middle manager nervous, especially as many of the tricks and tips come from e-mails sent to Adams by his fans (one tip: <i>never</i> let anyone else use your computer). If these messages are any indication, the creative tide has turned, and now the corporate world is following Dilbert's lead. In the office blocks of America, life is imitating art imitating life, creating a pleasantly postmodern working environment. The final chapter of <i>The Joy of Work</i>, "Handling Criticism," includes a response to Norman Solomon's <i>The Trouble with Dilbert</i>, which accuses Adams of selling out and supporting the corporate hierarchy that he claims to satirize. Adams's response is thorough and convincing, with just enough nastiness (jokes about Solomon's hair, for example) to demonstrate that although Dilbert may not have a mouth, he certainly has teeth. <i>--Simon Leake</i>Scott Adams is the creator of <em>Dilbert,</em> the comic strip that now appears in 1,550 newspapers worldwide.

Now, the man who was once a homicide detective and unwilling SS officer in Hitler&#x2019;s Third Reich is simply the person you turn to for touring tips or if you need a bridge partner. <br><br>As it just so happens, a rich and famous writer needs someone to fill the fourth seat in a regular game at the Villa Mauresque. But Somerset Maugham wants Bernie to help him get out of a game far more dangerous than bridge.&nbsp;Maugham is being blackmailed&#x2014;perhaps because of his unorthodox lifestyle, or perhaps because, once upon a time, Maugham worked for the British Secret Service...</p><p><b>Philip Kerr</b>&nbsp;was the<i> New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of the acclaimed Bernie Gunther novels, three of which&#x2014;<i>Field Gray</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Lady from Zagreb</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Prussian Blue</i>&#x2014;were finalists for the Edgar Award for Best Novel. Kerr also won several Shamus Awards and the British Crime Writers&#x2019; Association Ellis Peters Award for Historical Crime Fiction. Just before his death in 2018, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. As P.B. Kerr, he was the author of the much-loved young adult fantasy series Children of the Lamp.<p><b>Chapter 1: French Riviera 1956</b></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday I tried to kill myself.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn&#x2019;t that I wanted to die as much as the fact that I wanted the pain to stop. Elisabeth, my wife, left me a while ago and I&#x2019;d been missing her a lot. That was one source of pain, and a pretty major one, I have to admit. Even after a war in which more than four million German soldiers died, German wives are hard to come by. But another serious pain in my life was the war itself of course, and what happened to me back then, and in the Soviet POW camps afterwards. Which perhaps made my decision to commit suicide odd considering how hard it was not to die in Russia; but staying alive was always more of a habit for me than an active choice. For years under the Nazis I stayed alive out of sheer bloody mindedness. So I asked myself, early one Spring morning, why not kill yourself?&nbsp; To a Goethe-loving Prussian like me the pure reason of a question like that was almost unassailable. Besides, it wasn&#x2019;t as if life was so great anymore, although in truth I&#x2019;m not sure it ever was. Tomorrow and the long, long empty year to come after that isn&#x2019;t something of much interest to me, especially down here on the French Riviera. I was on my own, pushing sixty and working in a hotel job that I could do in my sleep, not that I got much of that these days. Most of the time I was miserable. I was living somewhere I didn&#x2019;t belong and it felt like a cold corner in hell, so it wasn&#x2019;t as if I believed anyone who enjoys a sunny day would miss the dark cloud that was my face.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was all that for choosing to die, plus the arrival of a guest at the hotel. A guest I recognized and wished I hadn&#x2019;t. But I&#x2019;ll come to him in a moment. Before that I have to explain why I&#x2019;m still here.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went into the garage underneath my small apartment in Villefranche, closed the door, and waited in the car with the engine turning over. Carbon monoxide poisoning isn&#x2019;t so bad. You just close your eyes and go to sleep. If the car hadn&#x2019;t stalled or perhaps just run out of gas I wouldn&#x2019;t be here now. I thought I might try it again another time, if things didn&#x2019;t improve and if I bought a more reliable motor car. On the other hand, I could have returned to Berlin, like my poor wife, which might have achieved the same result. Even today it&#x2019;s just as easy to get yourself killed there as it ever was and if I were to go back to the former German capital, I don&#x2019;t think it would be very long before someone was kind enough to organize my sudden death. One side or the other has got it in for me, and with good reason. When I was living in Berlin and being a cop or an ex-cop, I managed to offend almost everyone, with the possible exception of the British. Even so, I miss the city a lot. I miss the beer, of course, and the sausage. I miss being a cop when being Berlin police still meant something good. But mostly I miss the people who were as sour as I am. Even Germans don&#x2019;t like Berliners and it&#x2019;s a feeling that&#x2019;s usually reciprocated. Berliners don&#x2019;t like anyone very much - especially the women, which, somehow, only makes them more attractive to a dumb head like me. There&#x2019;s nothing more attractive to a man than a beautiful woman who really doesn&#x2019;t care if he lives or dies. I miss the women most of all. There were so many women. I think about the good women I&#x2019;ve known - quite a few of the bad ones, too - who I&#x2019;ll never see again and sometimes I start crying and from there it&#x2019;s only a short trip to the garage and asphyxiation, especially if I&#x2019;ve been drinking. Which, at home, is most of the time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I&#x2019;m not feeling sorry for myself I play bridge, or read books about playing bridge, which might strike a lot of people as a pretty good reason on its own to kill yourself. But it&#x2019;s a game I find stimulating. Bridge helps to keep my mind sharp and occupied with something other than thoughts of home - and all those women, of course. In retrospect it seems that a great many of them must have been blondes and not just because they were German, or close to being German. Rather too late in life I&#x2019;ve learned that there&#x2019;s a type of woman I&#x2019;m attracted to, which is the wrong type, and it often happens that this includes a certain shade of hair color that just spells trouble for a man like me. Risky mate search and sexual cannibalism are a lot more common than you might think, although more usual among spiders. Apparently the females assess the nutritional value of a male rather than a male&#x2019;s value as a mate. Which more or less sums up the history of my entire personal life. I&#x2019;ve been eaten alive so many times I feel like I&#x2019;ve got eight legs, although by now it&#x2019;s probably just three or four.&nbsp; It&#x2019;s not much of an insight, I know, and like I say, it hardly matters now, but even if it happens late in life a degree of self-awareness has to be better than none at all. That&#x2019;s what my wife used to tell me, anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-awareness certainly worked for her: she woke up one morning and realized just how bored and disappointed she was with me and our new life in France and went back home the very next day. I can&#x2019;t say that I blame her. She never managed to learn French, appreciate the food, or even enjoy the sun very much and that&#x2019;s the only thing down here of which there&#x2019;s a free and plentiful supply. At least in Berlin you always know why you&#x2019;re miserable. That&#x2019;s what Berlin<i> luft</i> is all about; an attempt to try to whistle your way out of the gloom. Here, on the Riviera, you would think there&#x2019;s everything to whistle about and no reason at all to be down in the mouth, but somehow I managed it and she couldn&#x2019;t take that anymore.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose I was miserable largely because I&#x2019;m bored as hell. I miss my old detective&#x2019;s life. I&#x2019;d give anything to walk through the doors of the police praesidium on Alexanderplatz - by all accounts it&#x2019;s been demolished by the so-called East Germans, which is to say the communists - and to go upstairs to my desk in the Murder Commission. These days I&#x2019;m a concierge at the Grand Hotel in St. Jean Cap Ferrat. That&#x2019;s a little bit like being a policeman if your idea of being a policeman is directing traffic and I should know. It&#x2019;s exactly thirty-five years since I was first in uniform, on traffic duty at Potsdamer Platz. But I know the hotel business of old; for a while after the Nazis got into power I was the house detective at Berlin&#x2019;s famous Adlon Hotel. Being a concierge is very different to that. Mostly it&#x2019;s about making restaurant reservations, booking taxis and boats, coordinating porter service, shooing away prostitutes - which isn&#x2019;t as easy as it sounds; these days only American women can afford to look like prostitutes - and giving directions to witless tourists who can&#x2019;t read a map and don&#x2019;t speak French. Only very occasionally is there an unruly guest or a theft and I dream of having to assist the local Sur�te to solve a series of daring jewel robberies of the kind I saw in Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s <i>To Catch a Thief</i>. Of course, that&#x2019;s all it is; a dream. I wouldn&#x2019;t ever volunteer to help the local police, not because they&#x2019;re French - although that would be a good reason not to help them - but because I&#x2019;m living under a false passport, and not just any false passport, but one that was given to me by none other than Erich Mielke, who is currently the deputy head of the Stasi, the East German Security Police. That&#x2019;s the kind of favor that sometimes comes with a high price tag and, one day, I expect him to come calling to get me to pay it. Which will probably be the day when I have to go on my travels again. Compared to me, the Flying Dutchman was the Rock of Gibraltar. I suspect my wife knew this, since she also knew Mielke and better than me.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite where I&#x2019;d go I have no idea although I hear North Africa is accommodating where Germans on a wanted list are concerned. There&#x2019;s a Fabre line boat that sails from Marseilles to Morocco every other day. That&#x2019;s just the sort of thing that a concierge is supposed to know although it&#x2019;s much more likely that there are rather more of the hotel&#x2019;s well-heeled guests who&#x2019;ve fled from Algeria than there are those who want to go there. Since the massacre of Pieds-Noirs civilians at Philippeville last year, the war against the FLN in Algiers isn&#x2019;t going so well for the French and by all accounts the colony is ruled even more harshly than it ever was when the Nazis left it to the tender mercies of the Vichy government.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#x2019;m not sure if the effortlessly handsome, dark-haired man I saw checking into one of the hotel&#x2019;s best suites the day before I tried to asphyxiate myself was on any kind of wanted list but he was certainly German and a criminal. Not that he looked like anything less affluent than a banker or a Hollywood film producer and he spoke such excellent French that it was probably only me who would have known he was German. He was using the name Harold Heinz Hebel and gave an address in Bonn, but his real name was Hennig, Harold Hennig and during the last few months of the war he&#x2019;d been a captain in the SD. Now in his early forties he wore a fine, gray lightweight suit that had been tailored for him and black, handmade shoes that were as shiny as a new centime. You tend to notice things like that when you&#x2019;re working at a place like the Grand Hotel. These days I can spot a Savile Row suit from the other side of the lobby. His manners were as smooth as the silk Herm�s tie around his neck, which suited him better than the noose it richly deserved. He tipped all of the porters handsomely from a wad of new notes that was as thick as a slice of bread, and after that the boys treated him and his Louis Vuitton luggage with more care than a case of Meissen porcelain. Coincidentally, the last time I&#x2019;d seen him he&#x2019;d also had some expensive luggage with him, filled with valuables he and his boss, the East Prussian <i>Gauleiter</i> Erich Koch, had probably looted from the city. That had been in January 1945, sometime during the terrible Battle of K�nigsberg. He&#x2019;d been boarding the German passenger ship, <i>Wilhelm Gustloff </i>which was subsequently torpedoed by a Russian submarine with the loss of more than nine thousand civilian lives. He was one of the few rats that managed to escape from that particular sinking ship, which was a great pity since he&#x2019;d helped to bring about its destruction.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Harold Hennig recognized me he didn&#x2019;t show it. In our black morning coats, the hotel&#x2019;s desk staff all tend to look the same, of course. There&#x2019;s that and the fact that I&#x2019;m a little heavier now than I was back then, with less hair probably, not to mention a light tan that my wife used to say suited me. For a man who just tried to kill himself I&#x2019;m in remarkably good shape, even though I say so myself. Alice, one of the maids I&#x2019;ve taken a shine to since Elisabeth left, says I could easily pass for a man ten years younger. Which is just as well as I have a soul that feels like it&#x2019;s at least five hundred years old. It&#x2019;s looked into the abyss so many times it feels like Dante&#x2019;s walking stick.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harold Hennig looked straight at me, and although I didn&#x2019;t hold his gaze for more than a second or two, there was no need - being an ex-cop, I never forget a face, especially when it belongs to a mass-murderer. Nine thousand people - men and women and a great many children is a lot of reasons to remember a face like Harold Heinz Hennig&#x2019;s.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I have to admit that seeing him again looking so prosperous and in such rude health left me feeling very depressed. It&#x2019;s one thing to know that there are people like Eichmann and Mengele who got away with the most appalling crimes. It&#x2019;s another thing when several of the victims of a crime were your friends. There was a time when I might have tried to exact some kind of rough justice, but those days are long gone. These days, revenge is something of which my partner and I talk lightly at the end or perhaps the beginning of a game of bridge at La Voile d&#x2019;Or, which is the only other good hotel in Cap Ferrat. I don&#x2019;t even own a gun. If I did I certainly wouldn&#x2019;t be here now. I&#x2019;m a much better shot than I am a driver.</p></p><h2>Johnny U: The Life and Times of John Unitas</h2><p>In a time &#x201c;when men played football for something less than a living and something more than money,&#x201d; John Unitas was the ultimate quarterback. Rejected by Notre Dame, discarded by the Pittsburgh Steelers, he started on a Pennsylvania sandlot making six dollars a game and ended as the most commanding presence in the National Football League, calling the critical plays and completing the crucial passes at the moment his sport came of age.<br><br><i>Johnny U</i> is the first authoritative biography of Unitas, based on hundreds of hours of interviews with teammates and opponents, coaches, family and friends. The depth of Tom Callahan&#x2019;s research allows him to present something more than a biography, something approaching an oral history of a bygone sporting era. It was a time when players were paid a pittance and superstars painted houses and tiled floors in the off-season&#x2014;when ex-soldiers and marines like Gino Marchetti, Art Donovan, and &#x201c;Big Daddy&#x201d; Lipscomb fell in behind a special field general in Baltimore. Few took more punishment than Unitas. His refusal to leave the field, even when savagely bloodied by opposing linemen, won his teammates&#x2019; respect. His insistence on taking the blame for others&#x2019; mistakes inspired their love. His encyclopedic football mind, in which he&#x2019;d filed every play the Colts had ever run, was a wonder.<br><br>In the seminal championship game of 1958, when Unitas led the Colts over the Giants in the NFL&#x2019;s first sudden-death overtime, Sundays changed. John didn&#x2019;t. As one teammate said, &#x201c;It was one of the best things about him.&#x201d;</p><p>Tom Callahan, a former senior writer at <i>Time</i> magazine and sports columnist at the <i>Washington Post</i>, is a recipient of the National Headliner Award. He has covered three decades of everything in major-league sports, from Sarajevo to Zaire, including hundreds of pro football games and numerous Super Bowls. Among his many <i>Time </i>cover subjects are San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana and Chicago running back Walter Payton. Callahan is the author of three other books, the most recent being <i>The Bases Were Loaded (And So Was I)</i>.ONE<br><br> 1933<br><br> &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m going to play professional football.&#x201d;<br><br> Francis Unitas and Helen Superfisky<br><br> &#x201c;My father&#x2019;s name was Leonard Unitas,&#x201d; states the autobiography of Johnny Unitas, Pro Quarterback, published in 1965 by Grosset and Dunlap. The funny thing is, his father&#x2019;s name was not Leonard. His brother&#x2019;s name was. Reading the book in 1965, Cameron Snyder of the Baltimore Sun noticed how reminiscent many of the passages were of newspaper stories Snyder had written or read. Whole columns by John Steadman of the News-Post and Sunday American appeared to have been redrawn in the first person and incorporated into the narrative. &#x201c;I always remember how surprised John Steadman, the sportswriter, was the morning of the championship game. . . .&#x201d;<br><br> When next he saw Unitas, Snyder said dryly, &#x201c;I got your book and I have only one question. Did you write it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hell,&#x201d; Unitas said, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t even read it.&#x201d;<br> <br> His father&#x2019;s name was Francis Joseph Unitas. Always Francis, never Frank (just as John was never Jack or even, as a boy, Johnny). When his mother died and his father could not cope, Francis was dispatched with two brothers, twins, to a Pittsburgh orphanage called the Toner Institute and Seraphic Home for Boys. (Two sisters and another brother were scattered elsewhere.) Both twins died in the orphanage, leaving Francis alone. The name of the one who died of influenza has been forgotten in time. The little boy who was run over by a train while trying to escape was named Adam.<br><br> At sixteen, the maximum age, Francis was sprung from the Toner Institute. Wrapping two shirts around an old baseball glove and waving good-bye to the Sisters of Divine Providence and the Capuchin Franciscan Fathers, he made for the coal country of West Virginia, hoping to pick up the trail of his lost siblings in a large Lithuanian community of miners. No relatives turned up then (one would, years later), but in an Old World enclave known as Century, Francis did make a significant find. She was a Lithuanian immigrant who worked in the company store and therefore, by necessity, could speak not only Lithuanian and English but also Russian and Polish. A self-taught piano player&#x2014;a self-taught everything&#x2014;she was the organist for Sunday Mass at the Catholic church. It seemed to Francis that there was nothing Helen Superfisky couldn&#x2019;t do.<br><br> To Helen, Francis was equally remarkable. He was tall&#x2014;right around six feet&#x2014;gangly, but amazingly powerful, almost in the manner of a circus strongman. He had huge hands, bigger than Lennie&#x2019;s in Of Mice and Men, busier than Wing Biddlebaum&#x2019;s in Winesburg, Ohio. Francis liked to lift things just to prove he could do it, roadside boulders and even the back wheels of coal trucks. Despite a comically improper technique, he out-tossed all of the local shot-putters (a regional specialty) and could fling a rock practically out of sight. Combing his brown hair in a confident wave, he was a showy character in every way, an all-around performer who boxed like a lighter man and could be plugged into any position on the town baseball team. They married.<br><br> Not quickly but by hard increments, over ten sweaty years, Francis and Helen Unitas worked their way up to owning a small coal truck and establishing their own delivery business back in the Brookline section of Pittsburgh. Though coal furnaces abounded, it was the 1930s; profits were meager. But the entire country was toiling for the minimum. To be working at all was the main thing. They lived more than modestly in a one-bathroom house that was rather like a hive, buzzing as it did with a swarm of Superfiskys that included Helen&#x2019;s parents, several layers of cousins and in-laws, and a great-uncle, Tony, who was stricken with silicosis (&#x201c;miner&#x2019;s asthma&#x201d;). Hanging bedsheets for privacy, Francis, Helen, and all four of their children&#x2014;Leonard, Millicent, John, and Shirley&#x2014;slept together in the dining room.<br><br> Stood up by his helpers in the bitter September of 1938, Francis put in a long day doing his own job, dropping the black piles here and there all over town, and then a longer night doing theirs, assembling the chutes and shoveling the coal into basement bins. Working at breakneck speed, he took on the task as another exhibition of superhuman strength&#x2014;an impossible race against daybreak&#x2014;and won. But he caught pneumonia and died, technically of uremia, kidney failure. Francis Joseph Unitas wasn&#x2019;t quite thirty-eight years old. John Constantine Unitas, born on the seventh of May 1933, was five.<br><br> &#x201c;John was the apple of his dad&#x2019;s eye,&#x201d; said big brother Leonard without resentment. The unread autobiography wasn&#x2019;t so wrong at that. In a way, Leonard was John&#x2019;s father. Eleven years old when Francis died, Leonard was already as averse to melodrama and immune to sentimentality as John would grow up to be. For instance, Leonard could believe that one of his orphaned uncles was killed hopping a freight train, but he always wondered if the &#x201c;escape&#x201d; part of Adam&#x2019;s story wasn&#x2019;t embroidery. &#x201c;There weren&#x2019;t any railroad tracks,&#x201d; Leonard said with twinkling eyes, &#x201c;anywhere near the Toner Institute.&#x201d; Sister Millie, three years younger than Leonard, three years older than John, didn&#x2019;t care one way or the other. But the &#x201c;children,&#x201d; John and Shirley, never questioned the family&#x2019;s heroic tragedy. It thrilled them and broke their hearts.<br><br> &#x201c;I have pictures of us with Dad and the truck,&#x201d; Shirley said, &#x201c;but no recollections of him at all. I don&#x2019;t even remember the sound of his voice. The only memories I have are little ones that John shared with me: like Dad flying up the stairs three steps at a time to make sure Mom wasn&#x2019;t hurting John in the bath. I think there was a lot of my dad in John that we didn&#x2019;t know or recognize, but Mom did.&#x201d; He had those same big dukes. (Anyone who ever shook the hand of Johnny Unitas never forgot it.)<br><br> One year apart, John and Shirley were Jem and Scout. He called her Tootsie. The others laughed at how quiet he was. &#x201c;He very seldom spoke,&#x201d; according to Leonard. &#x201c;Once in a while he&#x2019;d come out with something.&#x201d; But Shirley understood his silences. &#x201c;John was always thinking,&#x201d; she said. And blinking. Many who later huddled with him swore they could hear his eyeballs clicking as he double-checked his calculations. At ages ten and nine, John and Shirley were fused together permanently by forty-two plunges of a syringe. Shirley said, &#x201c;John loved animals more than anything, you know. We always had a dog.&#x201d; Tippy was killed in traffic. Skippy wasn&#x2019;t nearly as adventurous. Weegee was another story entirely. The sweetest in the long line of mysteriously bred mutts that Leonard kept rescuing from the pound, Weegee was the only dog they ever had who could give the OK signal with his tail. Missing for three days, he came home wet, bedraggled, and rabid. As John and Shirley were washing him in a tin tub, Weegee changed personalities. Both kids were nipped on the face and nose.<br><br> Panting turned to growling turned to screaming. Summoned from work, Leonard was able to trap Weegee in the cellar. While nobody slept, the poor dog moaned all night and made toothpicks out of his side of the door. When Leonard opened it a crack in the morning, Weegee lay there exhausted, his face bathed in a white froth and his jaws dripping foam. The police strapped him into an ugly leather harness and took him out in a bag. Two days later, John and Shirley were called to Southside Hospital for rabies shots. The hardest part was sitting through a torturous school day before climbing onto the streetcar alone. All the way there and back, they held hands.<br><br> In the same room, each received twenty-one injections, first in the stomach, then in one buttock, then in the other, then in one arm, then in the other, then back in the stomach, and around again, and again and again. Did John cry? &#x201c;Oh, God, no,&#x201d; Shirley said. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t either, in front of him.&#x201d; On the return trip, as the streetcar approached their stop, John whispered the first full sentence of the day: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only a needle, Toots.&#x201d; He was Johnny Unitas at ten.<br> <br> With Francis gone, Helen streamlined the family and dropped down a social notch to a two-bedroom house on unpaved William Street in Mount Washington. &#x201c;The highlight of the year,&#x201d; said a neighbor, Joe Chilleo, &#x201c;was when the scrapers came up to scrape the street just before the election. We&#x2019;d go out there and watch them. We thought it was wonderful.&#x201d; Helen, Millie, and Shirley shared one of the bedrooms; Leonard, John, and Great-Uncle Tony the other. Although he could cough with Doc Holliday, Tony was good company. There still was only one bath. To Millie, it was &#x201c;like living on the tip of a mountaintop.&#x201d; From the porch of their yellow house, which looked orange at sunset, you could see the city, a few tall buildings at least, the Monongahela River, and the bridge where the streetcars crossed over. &#x201c;The automobiles were just specks,&#x201d; she said.<br><br> Until Leonard was old enough to drive the coal truck, men were hired to work under Helen&#x2019;s supervision. They set no records for sobriety. The sisters at Saint Justin&#x2019;s School, including a six-foot-three nun whom everybody called Big Red, pretended not to notice Leonard&#x2019;s grogginess in the morning (he had been up since four-thirty shoveling coal), and they sighed sympathetically every afternoon to see him hustling back to the job. Eventually, John would pull his share of after-school turns with the shovel. &#x201c;If you put in three tons,&#x201d; he said with a grin, &#x201c;you got ...</p><h2>Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery</h2><p>&#34; The Enneagram is an extraordinary framework for understanding more about ourselves. No matter from which point of view we approach it, we discover fresh conjunctions of new and old ideas.&#34; So writes Don Riso in this expanded edition of his classic interpretation of the Enneagram, the ancient psychological system used to understand the human personality. In addition to updating the descriptions of the nine personality types, Personality Types, Revised greatly expands the accompanying guidelines and, for the first time, uncovers the Core Dynamics, or Levels of Development, within each type. This skeletal system provides far more information about the inner tension and movements of the nine personalities than has previously been published. This increased specificity will allow therapists, social workers, personnel managers, students of the Enneagram, and general readers alike to use it with much greater precision as they unlock the secrets of self-understanding, and thus self-transformation.</p><p>Don Richard Riso is the foremost writer and developer of the Enneagram in the world today. The most-published and bestselling author in the field, he is an internationally recognized authority on the subject. He is the president of Enneagram Personality Types, Inc., and founder of The Enneagram Institute.<br><br>James Anderson Foster has narrated audiobooks for a variety of publishers, across nearly all genres-both fiction and nonfiction. In 2015, he was a finalist in three categories for the Society of Voice Arts and Sciences Voice Arts Awards (Mystery, Science Fiction, and Fantasy).A geometric figure made of nine intersecting lines, the enneagram is thought by some to represent nine basic personality types. These types, as defined here, are the Reformer, Helper (Bill Cosby, Gandhi), Status Seeker (Gary Hart), Artist, Thinker, Loyalist (Joseph McCarthy, Johnny Carson), Generalist, Leader and Peacemaker. If you're a type seven with an eight wing (like Joan Collins), then you're very aggressive and have a strong ego to back your demands. The trouble with this system is that, unlike astrology or numerology, it is speculative which personality type best fits an individual. Once you've established that, you then have to decide if the person in question is Healthy, Average or Unhealthy. Oscar Ichazo, founder of the Arica Institute, reportedly learned about the enneagram from Sufis in Afghanistan. The investigation here broadens Ichazo's framework but still leaves plenty of room for guesswork. Riso is a New Yorkbased enneagram consultant. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Instinctive Shooting II</h2><p>This book is the update (much additional information) to G.

Michael Lewis is our jungle guide through five of the most violent and costly upheavals in recent financial history: the crash of '87, the Russian default (and the subsequent collapse of Long-Term Capital Management), the Asian currency crisis of 1999, the Internet bubble, and the current sub-prime mortgage disaster. With his trademark humor and brilliant anecdotes, Lewis paints the mood and market factors leading up to each event, weaves contemporary accounts to show what people thought was happening at the time, and then, with the luxury of hindsight, analyzes what actually happened and what we should have learned from experience.</p><p>As he proved in <em>Liar's Poker</em>, <em>The New New Thing</em>, and <em>Moneyball</em>, Lewis is without peer in his understanding of market forces and human foibles. He is also, arguably, the funniest serious writer in America.</p></p><p><strong>Michael Lewis</strong> is the best-selling author of <em>Liar&#x2019;s Poker</em>, <em>Moneyball</em>, <em>The Blind Side</em>, <em>The Big Short</em>, and <em>The Undoing Project</em>. He lives in Berkeley, California, with his wife and three children.A compilation of articles by the author, one of today&#39;s most insightful chroniclers of American finance and culture, and other financial luminaries paints a vivid picture of the roads we took to get to this stage of the current economic debacle. While Jesse Boggs and Blair Hardman are both strong and effective, it&#39;s not clear what is added by the double narration. Either reader would have been fine for this basic commentary. Both render Lewis&#39;s subtle wit beautifully. The closing interview with the author is an added bonus. A good production for listeners who want some back story on how we got to this pass, and what we might expect as this economic crisis plays itself out. M.C. � AudioFile 2008, Portland, Maine</p><h2>The Book Of Eulogies</h2><p>This invaluable anthology is the first and only collection dedicated to the art of the eulogy. For the past several years, Phyllis Theroux has collected the most eloquent and moving writing commemorating a death, assessing a life, or offering solace to the bereaved. Ranging from Thomas Jefferson's magisterial eulogy for George Washington to Anna Quindlen's affectionate memorial for her grandmother; from Helen Keller's words about her dear friend Mark Twain to Adlai Stevenson's about Eleanor Roosevelt, <i>The Book of Eulogies</i> establishes that great eulogies are a celebration of remarkable lives that can illuminate, confirm, inspire, and redirect our own. <br> Theroux has included some of the world's most well-known tributes, such as Pericles' Funeral Oration, Jules Michelet's appreciation of Jeanne d'Arc, Victor Hugo's ringing words on the one hundredth anniversary of Voltaire's death, Cardinal Suenens's eulogy for Pope John XXIII. But most of the eulogized assembled here are eighteenth- to twentieth-century Americans, and the stories of their lives illuminate our history with a particularly intimate light. In Robert Kennedy's extemporaneous remarks upon hearing of the death of Martin Luther King, or Eugene McCarthy's tribute to his friend and colleague, Hubert Humphrey, the values, wisdom, and spirit of both the eulogized and the eulogizer are revealed. <br> <i>The Book of Eulogies</i> is a sourcebook for anyone who must find words of solace, understanding, and inspiration on the occasion of a beloved's death. It is also a treasury of astonishing eloquence, passion, and humanity -- a record of extraordinary lives, seen through the eyes of those who knew and loved them.</p><p>Author Phyllis Theroux has assembled a large collection of funeral praises, and, amazingly, there&#39;s nothing morbid about it. A number of noted writers, including Thomas Merton, Peter Matthiessen, William Styron, H. L. Mencken, Hannah Arendt, and many others offer very lively thoughts on the departed. The book is well organized in thematic sections, and included in the more than 100 essays are a number of tributes to people whose lives may have been ordinary, but who also inspired very moving tributes. As editor Theroux notes in her introduction: &#34;Some of the people are famous. Others are obscure. But all of them have one thing in common. When they died, someone wrote about them uncommonly well.&#34;<b>Phyllis Theroux</b> is the author of <i>California and Other States of Grace</i> and <i>Nightlights: Bedtime Stories for Parents in the Dark.</i> The founder of the Nightwriters seminar, she is a magazine columnist, children's book writer, and was a regular essayist on <i>The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.</i> She lives in Ashland, Virginia.</p><h2>Sackett&#39;s Land (Louis L&#39;Amour Collection)</h2><p>After discovering six gold Roman coins buried in the mud of the Devil&#x2019;s Dyke, Barnabas Sackett enthusiastically invests in goods that he will offer for trade in America. But Sackett has a powerful enemy: Rupert Genester, nephew of an earl, wants him dead. A battlefield promise made to Sackett&#x2019;s father threatens Genester&#x2019;s inheritance. So on the eve of his departure for America, Sackett is attacked and thrown into the hold of a pirate ship. Genester&#x2019;s orders are for him to disappear into the waters of the Atlantic. But after managing to escape, Sackett makes his way to the Carolina coast. He sees in the raw, abundant land the promise of a bright future. But before that dream can be realized, he must first return to England and discover the secret of his father&#x2019;s legacy.</p><p>Son of a feared fighting man, Barnabas Sackett inherited his father&#39;s fiery temper, sense of justice and warrior skills. Declared an outlaw in his native England, Barnabas set his daring sights on the opportunities of the New World. The ruthless piracy of the open seas and the unknown dangers of the savage American wilderness lay before him. And so did the thrill of discovery and the chance to establish a bold new future if he survived.Louis L'Amour is the only American-born novelist in history to receive both the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal.

For this reason Claude M. Bristol&#x2019;s book, <i>The Magic of Believing</i>, ought to enjoy widest readership.</p><p>In simple straightforward language, Mr. Bristol has set forth some basic principles of the fuller use of the mind in achieving practical objectives. He has illumined these potential uses with a wealth of descriptive instances, many of them based on his own personal experiences and observations embracing many years as a newspaper man and a successful business executive. He has traveled extensively over the world and has long investigated and studied what he calls &#x201c;Mind Stuff.&#x201d;</p><p>Claude Bristol has been helping people to help themselves for twenty years and I have been conversant with what the author has done with his theme during the period. I am also conversant with persons mentioned in this interesting book and with various successes they have achieved.</p><p>Mr. Bristol believes deeply that any person can achieve any given aim if he believes strongly enough and he presents a well documented case to prove his point. He makes no claim to being a &#x201c;mental healer,&#x201d; but his observations on the relationship of mind to health are of more than passing interest.</p><p><i>The Magic of Believing</i> does not delve into the occult. At the same time it does not limit the possibilities that telepathy and the use of the subconscious present.</p><p><i>The Magic of Believing</i> should be an inspiration to any one who reads it carefully because, in its development and its documentation, it is a clear picture of how the great potential possibilities of the mind may be utilized to achieve the ambitions of anyone interested.</p><p>Having served in World War I as well as having had a part in the war effort where I came in close contact with service people of World War II, and being aware of potential postwar problems, I should like to see a copy of this book in the hands of every ex-service man and woman as well as all others sincerely interested in making a place for themselves in the years to come.</p><p>PALMER HOYT</p><p>Editor and Publisher</p><p><i>The Denver Post</i></p><p>Denver, Colorado</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>Is there a something, a force, a factor, a power, a science&#x2014;call it what you will&#x2014;which a few people understand and use to overcome their difficulties and achieve outstanding success? I firmly believe that there is, and it is my purpose in this, first complete exposition of the subject, to attempt to explain it so that you may use it if you desire.</p><p>About fifteen years ago the financial editor of a great Los Angeles newspaper, after attending lectures I had given to financial men in that city and after having read my brochure, <i>T.N.T.&#x2014;It Rocks the Earth,</i> wrote:</p><p>&#x201c;You have caught from the ether something that has a mystical quality&#x2014;a something that explains the magic of coincidence, the mystery of what makes men lucky.&#x201d;</p><p>I realized that I had run across something that was workable, but I didn&#x2019;t consider it then, neither do I now, as anything mystical, except in the sense that it is unknown to the majority of people. It is something that has always been known to a fortunate few down the centuries, but, for some unknown reason, is little understood by the average person.</p><p>When I started out years ago to teach this science through the medium of lectures and my brochure, I wasn&#x2019;t certain that it could be or would be grasped by the ordinary individual; but now that I have seen those who have used it double and triple their incomes, build their own successful businesses, acquire homes in the country, and create sizable fortunes, I am convinced that any intelligent person who is sincere with himself can reach any heights he desires. I had no intention of writing a second book, although many urged me to do so, until a few months ago, when a woman in the book business, who had sold many copies of my first little book, literally &#x201c;read the riot act&#x201d; to me, declaring:</p><p>&#x201c;You have a duty to perform to the ex-service men and women, and all others who seek places for themselves in a postwar world, to give them in easily understood form not only what you contained in your <i>T.N.T.</i>&#x2014;<i>It Rocks the Earth</i> but the new material that you have given in your lectures. Everyone of ambition wants to get ahead and you have amply demonstrated you have something that will help anyone, and it&#x2019;s up to you to pass it along.&#x201d;</p><p>It took time to sell myself on the idea, but having served as a soldier in World War I, mostly in France and Germany, and having been an active official for many years in ex-service men&#x2019;s organizations as well as a member of a state commission to aid in the rehabilitation of ex-service men and women, I realized that it would be no easy task for many individuals to make outstanding places for themselves in a practical world from which they had long been separated. It is with them in mind, as well as all ambitious men and women, and with a sincere desire to help, that I write this full and detailed exposition of the power of belief.</p><p>I am cognizant of the fact that there are powerful forces at work in this country that would dominate us, substituting a kind of regimentation for the competitive system which has made America great among nations. They would attempt to destroy individual thinking and initiative, cherished ever since our Pilgrim Fathers established this country in defiance of Old World tyranny. I believe that we must continue to retain the wealth of spirit of our forefathers, for if we don&#x2019;t we shall find ourselves dominated in everything we do by a mighty few and shall become serfs in fact if not in name. Thus this work is written also to help develop individual thinking and doing.</p><p>Since I am aware that this book may fall into the hands of some who may call me a &#x201c;crackpot&#x201d; or a &#x201c;screwball,&#x201d; let me say that I am past the half-century mark and have had many years of hard practical business experience, as well as a goodly number of years as a newspaper man. I started as a police reporter, and police reporters are trained to get facts and &#x201c;accept nothing for granted.&#x201d; For a two-year period I was church editor of a large metropolitan newspaper, during which I came in close contact with clergymen and leaders of all sects and denominations, mind-healers, divine healers, Spiritualists, Christian Scientists, New Thought-ers, Unity leaders, sun and idol worshipers, and, yes, even a few infidels and pagans.</p><p>Gypsy Smith, well-known English evangelist, was making an early tour of America at that time, and as I used to sit night after night on his platform, watching people stumble down the aisles, some sobbing, others shouting hysterically, I wondered.</p><p>Again I wondered as I accompanied the police in answering a riot call when some Holy Rollers in a moment of hysteria knocked over a stove and set fire to their meeting hall. When I attended my first and only meeting of Shakers, I wondered as I did while attending various spiritualistic meetings. I wondered as I heard the testimonials at the Wednesday night meetings of Christian Scientists. I wondered when I witnessed a group of white people being immersed in the icy waters of a mountain stream and coming up shouting &#x201c;Hallelujah,&#x201d; even though their teeth were chattering. I wondered at the ceremonial dances of the Indians and their rain-calling programs. Billy Sunday also caused me to wonder, as in later years did Aimee Semple McPherson.</p><p>In France during the first war I marveled at the simple faith of the peasants and the powers of their village padres. The stories of the so-called miracles at Lourdes, as well as of somewhat similar miracles at other shrines, also held great interest. When I saw elderly men and women in a famous old Roman church climb literally on their knees up a long flight of stairs to gaze upon a holy urn&#x2014;a climb that is no simple task for an athletically trained young person&#x2014;I wondered again.</p><p>Business brought me into contact with the Mormons, and when I heard of the belief in the story of Joseph Smith and the revelations on the plates of gold, I was again given to wonderment. The Dukhobors of western Canada, who would doff their clothes when provoked, likewise made me wonder. While in Hawaii I heard much about the powers of the kahunas who, it was claimed, could, by praying, cause people to die or live. The great powers attributed to these kahunas profoundly impressed me.</p><p>In my early days as a newspaper man I saw a famous medium try to make the &#x201c;spirits&#x201d; respond before a crowded courtroom of antagonistic scoffers. The judge had promised the medium he would be freed if he could get the &#x201c;spirits&#x201d; to speak in the courtroom. They failed to materialize and I wondered why, because the medium&#x2019;s followers had testified to remarkable prior s�ances.</p><p>Many years later I was commissioned to write a series of articles on what is known in police parlance as the &#x201c;fortune-telling racket.&#x201d; I visited everything from gypsy phrenologists to crystal-ball gazers, from astrologers to spiritualistic mediums. I have heard what purported to be the voices of old Indian &#x201c;guides&#x201d; tell me the past, the present, and the future, and I heard from relatives I never knew existed.</p><p>Several times I have been in a hospital room in which people around me died, while others with seemingly no worse ailments were up and apparently fully recovered within a short time. I have known partially paralyzed people who claim they have cured their rheumatism or arthritis by wearing a copper band around their wrists&#x2014;and have known others who claimed a cure by mental healing. From relatives and close friends I have heard stories of how warts on hands have suddenly disappeared. I am familiar with the stories of those who permit rattlesnakes to bite them and still live, and with hundreds of other tales of mysterious healings and happenings.</p><p>I have, moreover, made myself familiar with the lives of great men and women of history; I have met and interviewed many outstanding men and women in all lines of human endeavor; and I have often wondered just what it was that took them to the top while others were lost in obscurity. I have seen coaches take apparently inferior baseball and football teams and infuse them with &#x201c;something&#x201d; that caused them to win. In the depression days I saw sales organizations, badly whipped, do an abrupt about-face and bring in more business than ever before.</p><p>Apparently I was born with a huge bump of curiosity, for I have always had an insatiable yearning to seek explanations and answers. This yearning has taken me to many strange places, brought to light many peculiar cases, and has caused me to read every book I could get my hands on dealing with religions, cults, and both physical and mental sciences. I have read literally thousands of books on modern psychology, metaphysics, ancient magic, Voodooism, Yogism, Theosophy, Christian Science, Unity, Truth, New Thought, Cou�ism, and many others dealing with what I call &#x201c;Mind Stuff,&#x201d; as well as the philosophies and teachings of the great masters of the past.</p><p>Many were nonsensical, others strange, and many very profound. Gradually I discovered that there is a golden thread that runs through all the teachings and makes them work for those who sincerely accept and apply them, and that thread can be named in the single word&#x2014;<i>belief.</i> It is this same element or factor, belief, which causes people to be cured through mental healing, enables others to climb high the ladder of success, and gets phenomenal results for all who accept it. Why belief is a miracle worker is something that cannot be satisfactorily explained; but have no doubt about it, there&#x2019;s genuine magic in believing. &#x201c;The magic of believing&#x201d; became a phrase around which my thoughts steadily revolved.</p><p>I am convinced that in the so-called secret fraternal organizations there is a real &#x201c;royal secret&#x201d; which very few members ever grasp, and the conclusion must be that &#x201c;no mind ever receives the truth until it is prepared to receive it.&#x201d; I am convinced also that some of these organizations, like many secret orders which have a knowledge and an understanding of life, use parables and misinterpretations to mislead. In one order, candidates are provided with a very profound book (to be studied in connection with the degree work), which itself would be well-nigh an open-sesame to life if these candidates would understand and follow its tenets; but few read it, complaining that &#x201c;it is too deep&#x201d; for them.</p><p>When <i>T.N.T.&#x2014;It Rocks the Earth</i> was first published, I imagined that it would be easily understood, as I had written it simply; but as the years went by I found that some readers protested that it was too much in digest form, while others said they couldn&#x2019;t understand it. I had assumed that most people knew something about the power of thought. I was mistaken, and I realized that those who had an understanding of the subject were comparatively few. Later in my many years of lecturing before clubs, business and sales organizations, I discovered that while most people were vitally interested in the subject, it had to be fully explained. Finally, I undertook to write this book in words that anyone who reads can understand and with the hope that it will help many to reach their goal in life.</p><p>The science of thought is as old as man himself. The wise men of all ages have known about it and used it. The only thing the writer has done is to put the subject in modern language and bring to the reader&#x2019;s attention what a few of the outstanding minds of today are doing to substantiate the great truths that have come down through the centuries.</p><p>Fortunately for the world, people generally are coming to the realization that there is &#x201c;something to this mind-stuff after all,&#x201d; and the writer believes that there are millions of people who would like to get a better understanding of it and prove that it does work.</p><p>Therefore, I start with relating a few experiences of my own life, with the hope that by hearing them, you will gain a better understanding of the entire science. Early in 1918 I landed in France as a &#x201c;casual&#x201d; soldier, unattached to a regular company. As a result it was several weeks before my service record, necessary for my pay, caught up with me. During that period I was without money to buy gum, candy, cigarettes, and ...</p></p><h2>Aiden&#39;s Charity (Wolf Breeds, Book 3)</h2><p>Book 3 in the Wolf Breeds series The forces of survival and destruction swirl in the darkest corners of men&#39;s minds.

By the author of Third Degree. 500,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Greg Iles </b>was born in 1960 in Germany, where his father ran the U.S. Embassy medical clinic during the height of the Cold War. After graduating from the University of Mississippi in 1983, he performed for several years with the rock band Frankly Scarlet and is currently a member of the band The Rock Bottom Remainders. His first novel, <i>Spandau Phoenix</i>, a thriller about Nazi war criminal Rudolf Hess, was published in 1993 and became a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller. Iles went on to write numerous bestselling novels, including <i>Third Degree</i>, <i>True Evil</i>, <i>Turning Angel</i>, <i>Blood Memory</i>, <i>The Footprints of God</i>, and <i>24 Hours</i> (released by Sony Pictures as <i>Trapped</i>, with full screenwriting credit for Iles). He lives in Natchez, Mississippi.The Devil&#x2019;s Punchbowl <br> <br> CHAPTER<br> 1<p></p> <br><br>Midnight in the garden of the dead.<br> <br>A silver-white moon hangs high over the mirror-black river and the tired levee, shedding cold light on the Louisiana delta stretching off toward Texas. I stand among the luminous stones on the Mississippi side, shivering like the only living man for miles. At my feet lies a stark slab of granite, and under that stone lies the body of my wife. The monument at its head reads:<br><br>SARAH ELIZABETH CAGE<br> <br>1963&#x2013;1998<br> <br>Daughter. Wife. Mother. Teacher.<br> <br>She is loved.<br><br>I haven&#x2019;t sneaked into the cemetery at midnight to visit my wife&#x2019;s grave. I&#x2019;ve come at the urgent request of a friend. But I didn&#x2019;t come here for the sake of friendship. I came out of guilt. And fear.<br> <br>The man I&#x2019;m waiting for is forty-five years old, yet in my mind he will always be nine. That&#x2019;s when our friendship peaked, during the Apollo 11 moon landing. But you don&#x2019;t often make friends like those you make as a boy, so the debt is a long one. My guilt is the kind you feel when someone slips away and you don&#x2019;t do enough to maintain the tie, all the more painful because over the years Tim Jessup managed to get himself into quite a bit of trouble, and after the first eight or nine times, I wasn&#x2019;t there to get him out of it.<br> <br>My fear has nothing to do with Tim; he&#x2019;s merely a messenger, one who may bear tidings I have no wish to hear. News that confirms the rumors being murmured over golf greens at the country club, bellowed between plays beside high school gridirons, and whispered through the hunting camps like a rising breeze before a storm. When Jessup asked to meet me, I resisted. He couldn&#x2019;t have chosen a worse time to discover a conscience, for me or for the city. Yet in the end I agreed to hear him out. For if the rumors are true&#x2014;if a uniquely disturbing evil has entered into my town&#x2014;it was I who opened the door for it. I ran for mayor in a Jeffersonian fit of duty to save my hometown and, in my righteousness, was arrogant enough to believe I could deal with the devil and somehow keep our collective virtue intact. But that, I&#x2019;m afraid, was wishful thinking.<br> <br>For months now, a sense of failure has been accreting in my chest like fibrous tissue. I&#x2019;ve rarely failed at anything, and I have never quit. Most Americans are raised never to give up, and in the South that credo is practically a religion. But two years ago I stood before my wife&#x2019;s grave with a full heart and the belief that I could by force of will resurrect the idyllic town that had borne me, by closing the racial wounds that had prevented it from becoming the shining beacon I knew it could be, and bringing back the prosperity it deserved. Halfway through my four-year term, I&#x2019;ve learned that most people don&#x2019;t want change, even when it&#x2019;s in their best interest. We pay lip service to ideals, but we live by expediency and by tribal prejudice. Accepting this hypocrisy has nearly broken me.<br> <br>Sadly, the people closest to me saw this coming long ago. My father and my lover at the time tried to save me from myself, but I would not be swayed. The heaviest burden I bear is knowing that my daughter has paid the highest price for my illusions. Two years ago, I imagined I heard my dead wife&#x2019;s voice urging me onward. Now all I hear is the empty rush of the wind, whispering the lesson so many have learned before me: You can&#x2019;t go home again.<br> <br>My watch reads 12:30 a.m. Thirty minutes past the appointed hour, and there&#x2019;s still no sign of Tim Jessup among the shoulder-high stones between me and Cemetery Road. With a silent farewell to my wife, I turn and slip between the monuments, working my way back up toward Jewish Hill, our rendezvous point. My feet make no sound in the dewy, manicured grass. The names chiseled on these stones I&#x2019;ve known all my life. They are the town&#x2019;s history, and mine: Friedler and Jacobs and Dreyfus up on Jewish Hill, whose stones read Bohemia, Bavaria, Alsace; the Knoxes and Henrys and Thornhills in the Protestant sections; and finally the Donnellys and Binellis and O&#x2019;Banyons back on Catholic Hill. Most of the corpses in this place had white skin when they were alive, but as in life, the truth here is found at the margins. In the areas marked &#x201c;Colored Ground&#x201d; on the cemetery map lie the trusted servants and favored slaves who lived at the margins of the white world and earned a patch of hallowed earth in death. Most of these were interred without a marker. You have to go farther down the road, to the national cemetery, to find the graves of truly free black people, many of them soldiers who lie among the twenty-eight hundred unknown Union dead.<br> <br>Yet this cemetery breathes an older history. Some people buried here were born in the mid-1700s, and if they were resurrected tomorrow, parts of the town would not look much different to them. Infants who died of yellow fever lie beside Spanish dons and forgotten generals, all moldering beneath crying angels and marble saints, while the gnarled oak branches spread ever wider above them, draped with cinematic beards of Spanish moss. Natchez is the oldest city on the Mississippi River, older even than New Orleans, and when you see the dark, tilted gravestones disappearing into the edges of the forest, you know it.<br> <br>I last came here to view a million dollars in damage wreaked by drunk vandals on the irreplaceable wrought iron and statuary that make this cemetery unique. Now all four gates are chained shut at dusk. Tim Jessup knows that; it&#x2019;s one reason he chose this trysting place. When Jessup first called, I thought he was proposing the cemetery for his convenience; he works on one of the riverboat casinos at the foot of the bluff&#x2014;the Magnolia Queen, moored almost directly below Jewish Hill&#x2014;and midnight marks the end of his shift. But Tim insisted that the cemetery&#x2019;s isolation was a necessity, for me as much as for him. Swore, in fact, that I could trust neither my own police department nor any official of the city government. He also made me promise not to call his cell phone or his home for any reason. Part of me considers his claims ridiculous, but a warier clump of brain cells knows from experience that corruption can run deep.<br> <br>I was a lawyer in another life&#x2014;a prosecutor. I started out wanting to be Atticus Finch and ended up sending sixteen people to death row. Looking back, I&#x2019;m not sure how that happened. One day, I simply woke up and realized that I had not been divinely ordained to punish the guilty. So I resigned my position with the Houston district attorney&#x2019;s office and went home to my joyous wife and daughter. Uncertain what to do with my newfound surplus of time (and facing an acute shortage of funds), I began writing about my courtroom experiences and, like a few other lawyers slipstreaming in the wake of John Grisham, found myself selling enough books to place my name on the bestseller lists. We bought a bigger house and moved Annie to an elite prep school. An unfamiliar sense of self-satisfaction began to creep into my life, a feeling that I was one of the chosen, destined for success in whatever field I chose. I had an enviable career, a wonderful family, a few good friends, lots of faithful readers. I was young enough and arrogant enough to believe that I deserved all this, and foolish enough to think it would last.<br> <br>Then my wife died.<br> <br>Four months after my father diagnosed Sarah with cancer, we buried her. The shock of losing her almost broke me, and it shattered my four-year-old daughter. In desperation I fled Houston, taking Annie back to the small Mississippi town where I&#x2019;d been raised, back to the loving arms of my parents. There&#x2014;here&#x2014;before I could begin working my way back to earth, I found myself drawn into a thirty-year-old murder case, one that ultimately saved my life and ended four others. That was seven years ago. Annie&#x2019;s eleven now, and almost the reincarnation of her mother. She&#x2019;s sleeping at home while a babysitter waits in my living room, and remembering this I decide that Tim Jessup gets exactly five more minutes of my time. If he can&#x2019;t make his own midnight meeting, he can damn well come to City Hall during business hours, like everybody else.<br> <br>My heart labors from climbing the nearly vertical face of Jewish Hill, but each breath brings the magical scent of sweet olive, still blooming in mid-October. Under the sweet olive simmers a roux of thicker smells: kudzu and damp humus and something dead in the trees&#x2014;maybe a gut-shot deer that evaded its shortsighted poacher. When I reach the edge of the table of earth that is Jewish Hill, the land and sky fall away before me with breathtaking suddenness.<br> <br>The drop to the river is two hundred feet here, down a kudzu-strangled bluff of windblown loess&#x2014;rich soil made from rock ground fine by glaciers&#x2014;the foundation of our city. From this height you can look west over endless flatland with almost intoxicating pride, and I think that feeling is what made so many nations try to claim this land. France, Spain, England, the Confederacy: all tried to hold this earth, and all failed as surely as the Natchez Indians before them. A sagging wire bench still stands beneath an American flag at the western rim of the hill, awaiting mourners, lovers, and all the rest who come here; it looks like the best place to spend Tim&#x2019;s last four minutes.<br> <br>As I sit, a pair of headlights moves up Cemetery Road like a ship beating against the wind, tacking back and forth across the lane that winds along the edge of the bluff. I stand, but the headlights do not slow, and soon a nondescript pickup truck rattles past the shotgun shacks across the road and vanishes around the next bend, headed toward the Devil&#x2019;s Punchbowl, a deep defile out in the county where Natchez Trace outlaws once dumped the corpses of their victims.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it, Timmy,&#x201d; I say aloud. &#x201c;Time&#x2019;s up.&#x201d;<br> <br>The wind off the river has finally found its way into my jacket. I&#x2019;m cold, tired, and ready to go to bed. The next three days will be the busiest of my year as mayor, beginning with a news conference and a helicopter flight in the morning. But after those three days are up...I&#x2019;m going to make some profound changes in my life.<br> <br>Rising from the bench, I walk to my right, toward a gentler slope of the hill, where my old Saab waits beyond the cemetery wall. As I bend to slide down the hill, an urgent whisper breaks the silence of the night: &#x201c;Hey. Dude? Are you up here?&#x201d;<br> <br>A shadow is advancing along the rim of Jewish Hill from the interior of the graveyard. From my vantage point, I can see all four entrances to the cemetery, but I&#x2019;ve seen no headlights and heard no engine. Yet here is Tim Jessup, materializing like one of the ghosts so many people believe haunt this ancient hill. I know it&#x2019;s Tim because he used to be a junkie, and he still moves like one, with a herky-jerky progress during which his head perpetually jiggers around as though he&#x2019;s watching for police while his thin legs carry him forward in the hope of finding his next fix.<br> <br>Jessup claims to be clean now, thanks largely to his new wife, Julia, who was three years behind us in high school. Julia Stanton married the high school quarterback at nineteen and took five years of punishment before forfeiting that particular game. When I heard she was marrying Jessup, I figured she wanted a perfect record of losses. But the word around town is that she&#x2019;s worked wonders with Tim. She got him a job and has kept him at it for over a year, dealing blackjack on the casino boats, most recently the Magnolia Queen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Penn!&#x201d; Jessup finally calls out loud. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me, man. Come out!&#x201d;<br> <br>The gauntness of his face is unmistakable in the moonlight. Though he and I are the same age&#x2014;born exactly one month apart&#x2014;he looks ten years older. His skin has the leathery texture of a man who&#x2019;s worked too many years under the Mississippi sun. Passing him on the street under that sun, I&#x2019;ve seen more disturbing signs. His graying mustache is streaked yellow from cigarette smoke, and his skin and eyes have the jaundiced cast of those of a man whose liver hasn&#x2019;t many years left in it.<br> <br>What bound Jessup and me tightly as boys was that we were both doctors&#x2019; sons. We each understood the weight of that special burden, the way preachers&#x2019; sons know that emotional topography. Having a physician as a father brings benefits and burdens, but for eldest sons it brings a universal expectation that someday you&#x2019;ll follow in your father&#x2019;s footsteps. In the end both Tim and I failed to fulfill this, but in very different ways. Seeing him closer now, turning haplessly in the dark, it&#x2019;s hard to imagine that we started our lives in almost the same place. That&#x2019;s probably the root of my guilt: For though Tim Jessup made a lifetime of bad decisions&#x2014;in full knowledge of the risks&#x2014;the one that set them all in train could have been, and in fact was, made by many of us. Only luck carried the rest of us through.<br> <br>With a sigh of resignation, I step from behind the gravestone and call toward the river, &#x201c;Tim? Hey, Tim. It&#x2019;s Penn.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jessup whips his head around, and his right hand darts toward his pocket. For a panicked second I fear he&#x2019;s going to pull a pistol, but then he recognizes me, and his eyes widen with relief.<br> <br>&#x201c;Man!&#x201d; he says with a grin. &#x201c;At first I thought you&#x2019;d chickened out. I mean, shit.&#x201d;<br> <br>As he shakes my hand, I marvel that at forty-five Jessup still sounds like a strung-out hippie. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the one who&#x2019;s late, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>He nods more times than necessary, a man who&#x2019;ll do anything to keep from being still. How does this guy deal blackjack all night?<br> <br>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t rush off the boat,&#x201d; he explains. &#x201c;I think they&#x2019;re watching me. I mean, they&#x2019;re always watching us. Everybody. But I think maybe they suspect something.&#x201d;<br> <br>I want to ask whom he&#x2019;s talking about, but I assume he&#x2019;ll get to that. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see your car. Where&#x2019;d you come from?&#x201d;<br> <br>A cagey smile splits the weathered face. &#x201c;I got ways, man. You got to be careful dealing with this class of people. Predators, I kid you not. They sense a threat, they react&#x2014;bam!&#x201d; Tim claps his hands together. &#x201c;Pure instinct. Like sharks in the water.&#x201d; He glances back toward town. &#x201c;In fact, we ought to get behind some cover now.&#x201d; He gestures toward the three-foot-high masonry walls that enclose a nearby family plot. &#x201c;Just like high school, man. Remember smoking grass behind these walls? Sitting down so the cops couldn&#x2019;t see the glow of the roach?&#x201d;<br> <br>I never got high with Tim during high school, but I see no reason to break whatever flow keeps him calm and talking. The sooner he tells me what he came to say, the sooner I can get out of here.<br> <br>He vaults the wall with surprising agility, and I step over it after him, recalling with a chill the one memory of this place that I associate with Tim. Late one Halloween night a half dozen boys tossed our banana bikes over the wall and rode wildly through the narrow lanes, laughing hysterically until a pack of wild dogs chased us up into the oak trees near the third gate. Does Tim remember that?<br> <br>With a last anxious look up Cemetery Road, he sits on the damp ground and leans against the mossy bricks in a corner where two walls meet. I sit against the adjacent wall, facing him at a right angle, my running shoes almost touching his weathered Sperrys. Only now do I realize that he must have changed clothes after work. The dealer&#x2019;s uniform he usually wears on duty has been replaced by black jeans and a gray T-shirt.<br> <br>&#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t come out here dressed for work,&#x201d; he says, as though reading my mind.

He won the Edgar Award in 1989 for <i>Black Cherry Blues.</i> His two most recent novels, <i>Dixie City Jam</i> and <i>Burning Angel,</i> have been <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers. He divides his time between Missoula, Montana and Louisiana.<b>Chapter One</b> <p> I was just off Southwest Pass, between Pecan and Marsh islands, with the green, whitecapping water of the Gulf Stream to the south and the long, flat expanse of the Louisiana coastline behind me -- which is really not a coastline at all but instead a huge wetlands area of sawgrass, dead cypress strung with wisps of moss, and a maze of canals and bayous that are choked with Japanese water lilies whose purple flowers audibly pop in the morning and whose root systems can wind around your propeller shaft like cable wire. It was May and the breeze was warm and smelled of salt spray and schools of feeding white trout, and high above me pelicans floated on the warm air currents, their extended wings gilded in the sunlight, until suddenly one would drop from the sky like a bomb from its rack, its wings cocked back against its sides, and explode against the water's surface and then rise dripping with a menhaden or a mullet flapping from its pouched beak. </p><p> But the sky had been streaked with red at dawn, and I knew that by afternoon thunderheads would roll out of the south, the temperature would suddenly drop twenty degrees, as though all the air had suddenly been sucked out from under an enormous dark bowl, and the blackened sky would tremble with trees of lightning. </p><p> I had always loved the Gulf, no matter if it was torn with storms or if the surf was actually frozen with green ridges of ice. Even when I was a police officer in New Orleans, I had lived in a houseboat on Lake Pontchartrain and spent my off days fishing down in Lafourche Parish and Barataria Bay, and even though I was in homicide I sometimes worked deals through the boys in vice so I could go along on the Coast Guard cutter when they went after the dope runners out on the salt. </p><p> Now I owned a bait and boat-rental business on the bayou south of New Iberia, and twice a week my wife, Annie, and I headed out Southwest Pass in my converted jug boat and trawled for shrimp. It was called a "jug boat" because years ago it had been designed by an oil company for retrieving the long, thick, rubber-coated cables and seismic instruments used in marine oil exploration; it was long, narrow, and flat, with a big Chrysler engine, two screws, and the pilot's cab flush against the stern. Annie and I had outfitted it with ice bins, a bait well, winches for the nets, a small galley, fishing and scuba gear boxes welded to the gunnels, and even a big, canvas Cinzano umbrella that I could open up over a bridge table and folding chairs. </p><p> On mornings like this we'd trawl in a big circle through the Pass, the bow almost out of the water with the bursting weight of the net, then we'd load the ice bins full with pink-blue shrimp, set out the rods for gafftop catfish, and fix lunch in the galley while the boat drifted against the anchor rope in the warm wind. On this morning Annie had boiled a pot of shrimp and bluepoint crabs and was cleaning the shrimp in a bowl to mix with a pan of dirty rice we had brought from home. I had to smile as I watched her; she was my Mennonite-Kansas girl, with curly gold hair that lifted on the nape of her neck in the breeze, and eyes that were the most electric blue I had ever seen. She wore a man's faded denim shirt with the tails hanging over her white ducks, and canvas shoes with no socks; she had learned to clean fish and shrimp and handle a boat in a gale as well as if she had been born in the bayou country, but she would always remain my Kansas girl, sewn together from bluebonnets and sunflowers, tilting awkwardly on high heels, always awed by cultural difference and what she called "weirdness" in other people, although she came from a background of wheat-farmer pacifists that was so pervasively eccentric that she couldn't recognize normality when she saw it. </p><p> She had a tan even in winter, and the smoothest skin I had ever touched. Small lights played in her eyes when you looked into them. She saw me smiling at her, set down the bowl of shrimp, and walked past me as though she were going to check the rods, then I felt her behind me, felt her breasts touch the back of my head, then her hands collapsed my hair like a tangle of black snakes in my eyes, and her fingers traced my face, my brush mustache, my shoulders, the <i>pungi-</i>stick scar on my stomach that looked like a flattened, gray worm, until her innocent love made me feel that all my years, my love handles, my damaged liver were not important at all. Maybe I had grown foolish, or perhaps fond is a better word, in the way that an aging animal doesn't question its seduction by youth. But her love wasn't a seduction; it was unrelenting and always there, even after a year of marriage, and she gave it eagerly and without condition. She had a strawberry birthmark high up on her right breast, and when she made love her heart filled it with blood until it became a dark red. She moved around the chair, sat on my lap, rubbed her hand across the thin film of sweat on my chest, and touched her curly hair against my cheek. She shifted her weight in my lap, felt me under her, looked knowingly into my eyes, and whispered as though we could be heard, "Let's get the air mattress out of the locker." </p><p> "What are you going to do if the Coast Guard plane goes over?" </p><p> "Wave." </p><p> "What if one of the reels goes out?" </p><p> "I'll try to keep your mind on something else." </p><p> I looked away from her toward the southern horizon. </p><p> "Dave?" </p><p> "It's a plane." </p><p> "How often do you get propositioned by your own wife? Don't let opportunity pass, skipper." Her blue eyes were merry and full of light. </p><p> "No, look. He's in trouble." </p><p> It was a bright yellow, two-engine job, and a long trail of thick black smoke blew from behind the cabin all the way across the sky to the horizon. The pilot was trying hard to gain altitude, gunning both engines, but the wingtips wobbled from side to side and wouldn't stabilize and the water was coming up fast. He went past us and I could see faces in the glass windows. The smoke twisted out of a ragged hole just in front of the tail. </p><p> "Oh, Dave, I thought I saw a child," Annie said. </p><p> The pilot must have been trying to make Pecan Island so he could pancake into the salt grass, but suddenly pieces of the rudder shredded away like strips of wet cardboard and the plane dipped violently to port and turned in a half-circle, both engines stalling now, the smoke curling as thick and black as smoke from an oil fire, and went down hard on one wing against the water's surface, flipped over in the air like a stick toy, and landed upside-down in a huge spray of green and white water and floating seaweed. </p><p> The water boiled and danced on the overheated engine housings, and the hole in back actually seemed to create and suck a river deep inside the plane. In seconds the bright yellow underside of the plane was dimming in the low waves that slid across it. I couldn't see the doors, but I kept waiting for somebody in a life preserver to break through the surface. Instead, big balloons of air rose from the cabin, and a dirty slick of oil and gasoline was already obscuring the sun's winking refraction off the wings. </p><p> Annie was on the shortwave to the Coast Guard. I pulled the anchor free of the mud, threw it rattling into the bow, turned the big Chrysler engine over, heard the exhausts cough below the waterline, and hit it full throttle for the wreck. The wind and spray were like a cool slap in my face. But all I could see of the plane now were small gold lights in the floating blue-green stain of oil and gas leaking from broken fuel lines. </p><p> "Take the wheel," I said. </p><p> I saw her thoughts gathering in her face. </p><p> "We didn't refill the air tanks last time," she said. </p><p> "There's still some in there. It's not more than twenty-five feet here, anyway. If they haven't settled into the silt, I can get the doors open." </p><p> "Dave, it's deeper than twenty-five feet. You know it is. There's a trench right through the Pass." </p><p> I got the two air tanks out of the gear box and looked at the gauges. They both showed almost empty. I stripped down to my skivvies, hooked on a weight belt, put on one air tank and a mask, and slipped the canvas straps of the other tank over my arm. I picked up a crowbar out of the gear box. </p><p> "Anchor outside so one of them doesn't come up under the boat," I said. </p><p> "Leave the other tank. I'm going down, too." She had cut back the throttle, and the boat was pitching in its own wake. The side of her tanned face was wet with spray, and her hair was stuck to it. </p><p> "We need you up here, babe," I said, and went over the side. </p><p> "Damn you, Dave," I heard her say just as I plummeted with a clank of metal tanks through the water's surface. </p><p> The bottom of the Gulf was a museum of nautical history. Snorkel and scuba diving over the years, I had found clusters of Spanish cannonballs welded together with coral, U.S. Navy practice torpedoes, and the flattened hull of a Nazi submarine that had been depth-charged in 1942, a cigarette boat that dope runners had opened the cocks on before the Coast Guard had nailed them, and even the collapsed and twisted wreckage of the offshore oil rig on which my father drowned over twenty years ago. It lay on its side in the murk in eighty feet of water, and the day I swam down to it the steel cables whipped and sang against the stanchions like hammers ringing against an enormous saw blade. </p><p> The plane had settled upside down on the edge of the trench, its propellers dug deep in the gray sand. Strings of bubbles rose from the wings and windows. I felt the water grow colder as I went deeper, and now I could see crabs and jewfish moving quickly across the bottom and puffs of sand from the wings of stingrays that undulated and glided like shadows down the sides of the trench. </p><p> I got down to the pilot's door, slipped the spare tank off my arm, and looked through the window. He stared back at me upside down, his blond hair waving in the current, his sightless green eyes like hard, watery marbles. A short, thick-bodied woman with long black hair was strapped into the seat next to him, and her arms floated bac...</p></p><h2>Black Betty: An Easy Rawlins Mystery</h2><p>Detective Easy Rawlins returns in a mystery set in 1961 Los Angeles as Easy accepts a job searching for a beautiful woman nicknamed &#34;Black Betty,&#34; who works as a housekeeper in Beverly Hills. 75,000 first printing.

I didn't know where I was. The mattress was too soft. I reached over to get my watch but the night table wasn't there. I almost fell off the lawn chair onto the porch. Then I remembered how hot it was in the house. The kids, Jesus and Feather, had taken the only working fan to blow air from the window into Jesus's room. I'd come outside to the screened-in porch at two A.M. after waking up to find myself sweating in the bed.<br><br>I sat up trying to throw off the nightmare. It had been almost five years, but Bruno died in my dreams at least once a month -- more often recently. I'll never forget him being nailed to the wall by my best friend's gun.<br><br>I tried to think of better things. About our new young Irish president and Martin Luther King; about how the world was changing and a black man in America had the chance to be a man for the first time in hundreds of years. But that same world was being rocked almost daily by underground nuclear explosions and the threat of war.<br><br>Across town an old friend of mine, Martin Smith, lay dying. He'd been the closest thing to a teacher that I ever had. I knew that I had to go see him, to say goodbye, but I kept putting it off.<br><br>And through it all blew that hot September wind. It wouldn't let me rest. It just got hotter and hotter while my temper wore thin.<br><br>I wanted to feel better but all I had was the certainty that the world had passed me by -- leaving me and my kind dead or making death in dark causeways.<br><br>A strip of dawn light showed above the houses across the street. A better day might have been coming, for some people -- but not for everyone. Bruno was in his grave almost five years now, while Mouse languished in the state prison at Chino for manslaughter. I was in a kind of prison too. A prison of guilt, a prison of my mind.<br><br>"Mr. Rawlins?" a voice said.<br><br>My hand went straight for the pistol in the night-table drawer again. But I wasn't in my bedroom. I was naked, not even under a sheet, outside in the dark. I grabbed a ceramic ashtray that Jesus had made me at summer camp.<br><br>"Whoisit?" I tried to sound calm. The silhouette in the screened doorway was a man -- somewhere between five foot six and six foot five. With my free hand I took the sheet from the floor and held it to my crotch.<br><br>"Saul Lynx, Mr. Rawlins." A white man. "Can you talk?"<br><br>"Huh? What?" I clutched the misshapen slab of clay so hard that it cracked in my hand.<br><br>"I know it's early," the white man said. "But it's important that I speak with you. I got your name last night, but by the time I got a chance to come over it was too late. I was going to wait outside until later, but when I came up to check the address I heard you talking in your sleep. You see, I have to talk to you this morning."<br><br>"Then why don't you get-ass away from here and call me in the mornin'?" I could feel the strength in my arm build to the point where I could have hurled the ashtray through the screen. If he had touched the latch on the door he would have been a dead man.<br><br>But instead of taking any chances he said, "I've come to offer you a job. But you've got to start today -- this morning." Then he said, "Can we turn on a light or something?"<br><br>I didn't want him to see me with no clothes on. It was like I was still in a dream, as if I were vulnerable if someone could see my skin. I wanted to linger in those shadows, but I'd learned that you can't hide in your own house -- if somebody knows where you live you've got to stand up.<br><br>I wrapped the sheet around me like an African robe and reached inside the front door to switch on the porch light. Mr. Lynx was still hidden in the faint light beyond my screen.<br><br>"May I come in?" he asked.<br><br>"Come on then."<br><br>He was a smallish man in a light brown cotton suit and a loose dark brown tie. His nose was the only big thing on him -- protruding and somehow shapeless. If you'd forgotten his name you would have said, "You know, the guy with the nose." His cap was brown. He had on a white shirt to go with his pale skin. His eyes were brilliant green.<br><br>Saul Lynx smiled and bobbed his head, but I didn't take his hand.<br><br>"You won't be needing that." He was looking down at the ashtray. "I don't blame you for sleeping outside on a night like this. In the summers back in the Bronx when I was a boy I spent more time on the fire escape than I did in the apartment."<br><br>"What do you want, man?" I didn't have patience for his small talk.<br><br>"Like I say," he answered, unperturbed, "I've got a job for you. There's a woman missing and it's my client's desire to find her quickly."<br><br>The shadow of night was lifting from Genesee Avenue. I could make out the shapes of large carob trees across the street and the neat little lawns of my neighbors.<br><br>"Can we sit down?" Saul Lynx wanted to know.<br><br>"Say what you got to say, man, and then get outta here." I had children in the house and didn't want this stranger too comfortable in their home.<br><br>Saul Lynx had a smile that was just about as sincere as the kind of grin the undertaker puts on a corpse. "Have you ever heard of a woman named Elizabeth Eady?" he asked.<br><br>Her name struck a dark chord at the back of my mind. It fit with the humid September heat -- and with my dreams.<br><br>"She's lived in L.A. for almost twenty-five years, but she's from Houston originally," the little man was saying. "From down in your old neighborhood, I think. The only picture I have of her is this one." Lynx handed me an old brittle photograph. Its colors were rose-brown and tan instead of black and white. It wasn't a posed portrait, but a kind of snapshot. A young woman on the front porch of a small house. She was smiling at the time, leaning awkwardly against the doorjamb. She was tall and big-boned and very dark, even the rose coloring couldn't hide Betty's blackness. Her mouth was open as if she were smiling and flirting with the photographer. It brought a sense of intimacy that few amateur photographs have. Intimacy but not warmth. Black Betty wasn't your warm sort of homemaking girl.<br><br>Betty was a great shark of a woman. Men died in her wake.<br><br>If you heard that a friend of yours was courting Betty you could start crying then, because he was bound to come to harm. She had something about her that drove men wild. And she wasn't stingy with her charms. If a man could afford her supper, and her drink, she was happy to be with him. She'd go out with him on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday nights -- all night. Betty wasn't the kind who sat home, so if Friday came and his pockets were empty -- Betty was gone. Because when the sun went down, Betty and Marlon (Marlon, that was Betty's fancy half brother), they hit the streets. And if one man couldn't pay, another one was happy to take his place.<br><br>pard<br><br>Back then there weren't too many of your colored men who could afford a steady diet of Betty. Many a night, yesterday's boyfriend went up against tonight's man. Betty could draw blood three nights in a week, and if it ever bothered her she never let it show.<br><br>I had seen her sashaying down the wooden sidewalks of Houston's Fifth Ward. I was a raggedy twelve-year-old and she was more woman than I had ever seen in one place. She wore black lace, gloves, and fur and smelled so good that I forgot who I was. It was out in front of a bar called Corcheran's on Blanford Street. I guess I was looking pretty hard, my nostrils were probably flared out too.<br><br>"What you lookin' at, boy?" she asked me.<br><br>"You, ma'am."<br><br>"You like what you see?"<br><br>I had to swallow before saying, "Uh-huh, yes'm. You 'bout the prettiest woman I ever seen."<br><br>"About?"<br><br>I was crushed. I should have said the prettiest. She was the prettiest. I had ruined my chances of her ever talking to me again.<br><br>"Come on, honey," her date said.<br><br>But instead of listening to him Betty came over and kissed me -- right on the lips. She pushed her tongue out but I was too slow to open my own mouth. When she pulled back from me I fell on the ground from leaning into the embrace that didn't come.<br><br>They all laughed at me, all the men standing outside. But Betty didn't laugh. She was moved by her power over me. I would have fallen down for her any day. I would have jumped out of a window for her kiss.<br><br>"Do you know her, Mr. Rawlins?" Saul Lynx asked.<br><br>Dawn had come while I studied the picture. A car drove by and tossed a newspaper onto my lawn and the lawn next door. Almost immediately a spidery white woman came out of her house to retrieve her paper. Mrs. Horn was insomniac and impatient. She'd probably been waiting for hours just to get the news.<br><br>"I don't remember her," I said.<br><br>"Well..." He took a long time with the word as if to say that he didn't know whether to believe me or not. "That doesn't matter, not really. You're known for finding people in the colored part of town. That's why we need you."<br><br>"Who's we?"<br><br>"I'm the only one you need to be concerned with."<br><br>"What's she done?"<br><br>"Nothing as far as I know. She worked for a woman almost the whole time she's been up here. But something happened. Miss Eady quit and left her job and now her boss wants her to come on back." Saul Lynx smiled and caressed his nose like it was a favored pet. "She didn't leave a forwarding address and there's no Elizabeth Eady in the book."<br><br>"Who she work for?"<br><br>"I'm not at liberty to say."<br><br>"Uh-huh. And how much you payin' t'find her?"<br><br>"Two hundred dollars now and another two hundred when you find her." He pointed his baby finger at me. "But the job has got to be done quickly. From what I understand, the woman who's paying is very upset and wants to find Miss Eady soon."<br><br>"From what you understand?"<br><br>"Well, you see," he said, almost apologetically, "I haven't actually met the woman. She doesn't deal with dicks. It's her lawyer who hired me." He took a small fold of bills from his pants pocket and handed it in my general direction.<br><br>rI had the ashtray in one hand and the picture in the other.<br><br>"Two hundred dollars up front," he said.<br><br>It was more than I had in the bank. At one time I was flush with the income from apartment buildings I owned. I'd bought them with a windfall I'd come upon in 1948. But since then I'd stretched myself pretty thin trying to make it in the real estate game. I was almost bankrupt. The house I lived in was rented. We ate beans and rice for dinner three nights a week.<br><br>I put down the ashtray and took the bills. They were damp from being in his pants.<br><br>"I might look," I said tentatively. "But I'll want to talk to this lawyer guy myself before I give you anything I find. What you say his name was?"<br><br>"We'll talk about that when you've got something. I'll let him know that you'll be wanting to see to him, though." He couldn't have cared less about what I wanted. "How can he get in touch with you if he wants to talk?"<br><br>I told him my number and he nodded. Mr. Lynx was the kind of man who didn't write things down.<br><br>"How did you find me, Mr. Lynx? My address ain't in no book."<br><br>"You're famous, Mr. Rawlins." He took a cracked leather wallet from his back pocket. From this he produced a creased and soiled business card. It was damp too. It had a phone number and a Venice Beach address printed in black letters that had run slightly with the moisture. There wasn't a name, though.<br><br>"That's L-Y-N-X," he said. "Call me when you find something. And call me soon."<br><br>"How do you know that I won't just take this money and say you owed it to me for somethin'?"<br><br>Saul Lynx looked me in the eye and stopped his placid smiling. "I might be wrong, but I bet that you're the kind of man who does what he says, Mr. Rawlins. Anyway, there's still two hundred dollars to be made."<br><br>"Well, maybe so, but how do you expect me to find this one woman outta two and a half million people? You must have somethin' t'tell me about her." I already knew how to go about looking for Betty, but I wanted to know what that white man knew.<br><br>And he saw what I was about. A smile that bordered on respect grazed his lips. Then he shook his head. "Sorry, Mr. Rawlins, but all I know is that she has friends down in the Negro community. Maybe somebody you know will recognize her from the picture."<br><br>I would have given him the money back but I had an idea of how he found me -- and an itch to see Betty when I was a man.<br><br>"I'll be talkin' to ya," I said.<br><br>Lynx touched his forehead in a mock-friendly salute.<br><br>"Don't forget," he said. "I have to know about this soon."<br><br>He smiled and walked out. I watched him get into an especially small and tinny brown car. It was something foreign, I never knew what. As he drove off Mrs. Horn came out -- just curious, I suppose. When she saw me standing outside dressed in my toga her white face paled even more. I don't know what she thought. I smiled and called to her but she was already hurrying back into her house.<br><br>I picked up my own paper and read the headlines.

By the author of The Van. Winner of the Booker Prize.</p><p>In Roddy Doyle's Booker Prize-winning novel <i>Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha</i>, an Irish lad named Paddy rampages through the streets of Barrytown with a pack of like-minded hooligans, playing cowboys and Indians, etching their names in wet concrete, and setting fires. Roddy Doyle has captured the sensations and speech patterns of preadolescents with consummate skill, and managed to do so without resorting to sentimentality. Paddy Clarke and his friends are not bad boys; they're just a little bit restless. They're always taking sides, bullying each other, and secretly wishing they didn't have to. All they want is for something--<i>anything</i>--to happen. <p> Throughout the novel, Paddy teeters on the nervous verge of adolescence. In one scene, Paddy tries to make his little brother's hot water bottle explode, but gives up after stomping on it just one time: "I jumped on Sinbad's bottle. Nothing happened. I didn't do it again. Sometimes when nothing happened it was really getting ready to happen." Paddy Clarke senses that his world is about to change forever--and not necessarily for the better. When he realizes that his parents' marriage is falling apart, Paddy stays up all night listening, half-believing that his vigil will ward off further fighting. It doesn't work, but it is sweet and sad that he believes it might. Paddy's logic may be fuzzy, but his heart is in the right place. <i>--Jill Marquis</i></p>The 1993 Booker Prize winner. Paddy Clarke, a ten-year-old Dubliner, describes his world, a place full of warmth, cruelty, love, sardines and slaps across the face. He&#39;s confused; he sees everything but he understands less and less.</p><h2>Be Love Now: The Path of the Heart</h2><p><p>Ram Dass&#x2019;s long-awaited <em>Be Love Now</em> is the transformational teaching of a forty year journey to the heart.

In the national hysteria that followed, eight others were arrested and tried; four of those were executed, four imprisoned. Therein lie all the classic elements of a great thriller. But the untold tale is even more fascinating.<br><br>Now, in <i>American Brutus</i>, Michael W. Kauffman, one of the foremost Lincoln assassination authorities, takes familiar history to a deeper level, offering an unprecedented, authoritative account of the Lincoln murder conspiracy. Working from a staggering array of archival sources and new research, Kauffman sheds new light on the background and motives of John Wilkes Booth, the mechanics of his plot to topple the Union government, and the trials and fates of the conspirators.<br><br>Piece by piece, Kauffman explains and corrects common misperceptions and analyzes the political motivation behind Booth&#x2019;s plan to unseat Lincoln, in whom the assassin saw a treacherous autocrat, &#x201c;an American Caesar.&#x201d; In preparing his study, Kauffman spared no effort getting at the truth: He even lived in Booth&#x2019;s house, and re-created key parts of Booth&#x2019;s escape. Thanks to Kauffman&#x2019;s discoveries, readers will have a new understanding of this defining event in our nation&#x2019;s history, and they will come to see how public sentiment about Booth at the time of the assassination and ever since has made an accurate account of his actions and motives next to impossible&#x2013;until now.<br><br>In nearly 140 years there has been an overwhelming body of literature on the Lincoln assassination, much of it incomplete and oftentimes contradictory. In <i>American Brutus</i>, Kauffman finally makes sense of an incident whose causes and effects reverberate to this day. Provocative, absorbing, utterly cogent, at times controversial, this will become the definitive text on a watershed event in American history.</p><p>MICHAEL W. KAUFFMAN is a political historian and graduate of the University of Virginia who has studied the Lincoln assassination for more than thirty years. He has appeared on A&amp;E, the History Channel, C-SPAN, and the Learning Channel, and was called to testify as an expert witness in the 1995 Booth exhumation hearings. He lives in southern Maryland.ONE<br><br>&#x201c;By God, then, is John Booth crazy?&#x201d;<br><br> Good friday had never been a well-attended night at the theater, but on that evening, the city of Washington was in a partying mood. On Palm Sunday, General Robert E. Lee had surrendered his Virginia troops to General Ulysses S. Grant at the village of Appomattox Court House. Though some forces remained in the field, Lee had been the greatest obstacle on the path to victory. Now that his troops were out of the way, the bloodiest war in America&#x2019;s history would soon be over, and the celebrations had already begun. Four years to the day after its surrender, Fort Sumter was again under the Stars and Stripes. The flag raising there that day was marked with speeches, music, and prayers of thanks. There were prayers in Washington as well, but a lighter, more carefree atmosphere prevailed. There, buildings were &#x201c;illuminated&#x201d; with gas jets configured in the shape of stars, eagles, or words such as &#x201c;peace&#x201d; and &#x201c;victory.&#x201d; The city&#x2019;s population, which had ballooned to more than two hundred thousand during the war, had gone crazy. The streets were crawling with silly, drunken revelers&#x2014;soldiers back from the war, tourists passing through, and all the usual odds and ends&#x2014;staggering from one bar to another in search of a party and another toast to the military victors. All things considered, maybe this Good Friday 1865 was not such a bad night for the theater after all.<br><br>Ford&#x2019;s Theatre, on Tenth Street, was one of Washington&#x2019;s leading establishments. It had all the amenities of a first-rate playhouse. Its owner, John T. Ford, presented the finest talent the American stage had to offer. The audience that turned out this night made up a pretty fair cross section of Washington society: clerks, businessmen, politicians, tourists. And of course, there were soldiers. An ever-present part of life in the capital, they came to Ford&#x2019;s from every camp, fort, and hospital in the area, their dark blue uniforms scattered among the hoopskirts and crinolines. Some wore the light blue of the Veterans&#x2019; Reserve Corps, whose members once served in the ranks but were no longer suited for combat or strenuous duty. Here, they mingled comfortably with socialites, power brokers, and people from all walks of life. It was a diverse crowd, but nearly everyone had something in common, which explained, in large measure, the need to be in a house of entertainment on such a holy day: these people had been through hell.<br><br>One could hardly name an event in recent history that someone in this audience had not witnessed. Here were the veterans of Bull Run, Shiloh, and Gettysburg; the political warriors who shaped the nation; and the commercial giants of the age. One man had survived the horrors of Andersonville prison, and others had just arrived from Appomattox. This was more than just a &#x201c;large and fashionable audience&#x201d;; the people who came to Ford&#x2019;s Theatre that night had already been eyewitnesses to history. No doubt they were eager to get back to an ordinary life.<br><br>The play was Our American Cousin, a popular British comedy from the 1850s. Its humor was derived from the homespun &#x201c;Yankeeisms&#x201d; of Asa Trenchard, a backwoods Vermonter, and the physical eccentricities of Lord Dundreary, a self-important British nobleman. The star was Laura Keene, a London native, whose character, Florence Trenchard, believes that her cousin Asa (played by actor Harry Hawk) has just inherited the family fortune. Florence and her British relatives try to stay in Asa&#x2019;s good graces, but find it difficult to overlook his crass country-boy manners. It is this culture clash that carries the play.<br><br>For most of the audience that night, however, Our American Cousin was not the main attraction. A notice in that day&#x2019;s Evening Star had announced that President Abraham Lincoln and his wife would attend the performance. Their guest would be Ulysses S. Grant, lieutenant general of the army, victor of the recent war, hero of the hour. Their surprise reserva- tion had come in that morning, and it sent Harry Clay Ford, brother of the theater&#x2019;s owner, on a mad dash to organize a special program. A patriotic song called &#x201c;Honor to Our Soldiers&#x201d; was written for the occasion, and Ford sent notices of it to the Evening Star. He even redesigned the evening&#x2019;s playbill to reflect the new developments. By late afternoon, the reservations were rolling in. A normally dismal night was now showing some promise. By curtain time, at eight o&#x2019;clock, Ford&#x2019;s Theatre had a fairly good house.<br><br>Abraham Lincoln was famously fond of the theater, and had passed many an evening at Ford&#x2019;s or its competitor, the National. At Ford&#x2019;s, he always occupied the same box, on the right side, directly above the stage. It was an oddly shaped space with sharp angles and cramped, narrow corners, accessible only through a narrow passageway just off the balcony. It actually consisted of two boxes, numbered 7 and 8, which were normally divided by a partition. Stagehands set aside the divider and brought in more comfortable furniture to fill the space. For the president, a large walnut rocker, upholstered in burgundy damask, was placed in the corner nearest the door. A matching sofa went along the rear wall of the box, and the third piece, a large, comfortable armchair, was placed in the &#x201c;upstage&#x201d; corner, farthest from the door. The box had just enough space for those chairs, plus a small one for Mrs. Lincoln.<br><br>American flags were hung on either side, and two more were draped over the front balustrade. The blue standard of the Treasury Guards hung on a staff in the center, just above a gilt-framed portrait of George Washington. The flags added more than just a festive dash of color. They let everyone know where to look for the hero of Appomattox. Make no mistake about it: General Grant, and not Lincoln, was the evening&#x2019;s chief attraction.<br><br>James P. Ferguson was keeping an eye out for the general. Ferguson owned a saloon next door to the theater, and he always made a point of attending when the president was there. But he took a particular interest in Ulysses S. Grant, whom he claimed to have known since boyhood. When Harry Ford told him that Grant was coming, Ferguson bought two tickets for the dress circle, or first balcony, with a clear view into the box directly opposite. With the best seats in the house, &#x201c;Fergy&#x201d; brought along his young sweetheart so she could see the general as well.<br><br>They were in for a disappointment. General Grant had taken an afternoon train home to Burlington, New Jersey. A young couple came to the theater in his place. The presidential party arrived late, and as they appeared in the dress circle, the audience burst into a long, spontaneous ovation. The president acknowledged the approbation with a smile, then took his seat, partly hidden behind a flag. Miss Clara Harris took a seat at the far side of the box, and her fianc�, Major Henry Rathbone, sat on the sofa just behind her. Though Grant&#x2019;s absence was a disappointment, many in the audience assumed he would appear later. Ferguson, for one, kept a lookout for him.<br><br>By ten-fifteen, Our American Cousin had progressed to the second scene of the third act. Asa Trenchard had just told a woman named Mrs. Mountchessington that he hadn&#x2019;t inherited a fortune after all, as everyone thought, and the character (played by Helen Muzzy) had a change of heart about the marriage she had hoped to arrange between Asa and her daughter Augusta.<br><br>asa (to Augusta): You crave affection, you do. Now I&#x2019;ve no fortune, but I&#x2019;m biling over with affections, which I&#x2019;m ready to pour out to all of you, like apple sass over roast pork.<br><br>mrs. mountchessington: Mr. Trenchard, you will please recollect you are addressing my daughter, and in my presence.<br><br>asa: Yes, I&#x2019;m offering her my heart and hand just as she wants them, with nothing in &#x2019;em.<br><br>The president&#x2019;s guests seemed to enjoy the play. Miss Harris had been the Lincolns&#x2019; guest here before. Major Rathbone, of the 12th U.S. Infantry, was not quite so familiar to them. He had commanded a company under Burnside at Antietam and Fredericksburg. More recently, he had served as the head of disbursing for the Provost Marshal General&#x2019;s bureau. Henry and Clara had known each other since childhood, when her widowed father married his widowed mother.<br><br>Mary Todd Lincoln seemed especially pleased to make a public appearance that night. Sitting next to the president, she looked radiant in her flowered dress. She seemed to be enjoying a rare moment of happiness, her mind unburdened, for now, by personal loss and suffering. One lady in the audience noticed that Mrs. Lincoln smiled a great deal, and often glanced over at her husband.<br><br>The years had weighed heavily on Abraham Lincoln, and an occasional night out gave him a much-needed diversion. But even the theater did not free him from the weight of his duties. Twice he was interrupted by the delivery of messages. Charles Forbes, the White House messenger, brought one dispatch, then took a seat outside the entrance to the box. A newspaper reporter named Hanscom brought the other. Neither message seemed to require an immediate response, and the president settled quietly back in his rocking chair, head propped in his hand, looking lost in thought.<br><br>Though Lincoln was hidden from view most of the time, he occasionally leaned over the box railing to look down into the audience. That is how Isaac Jacquette, in the dress circle, got his first look at him. It was halfway into the play, and a woman sitting nearby remarked that she had never seen the president before. A man whispered that she might see him now, as he was leaning forward. Every time he came into view, the president stole the show.<br><br>On the far side of the dress circle, James Ferguson, still watching for General Grant, had borrowed his girlfriend&#x2019;s opera ...</p><h2>Loyalties: A Son&#39;s Memoir</h2><p>A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist&#39;s recounting of the tense and intimidating McCarthy era and his own leftist family&#39;s persecution in the name of patriotism describes family life under forty years of FBI surveillance</p><p>From the coauthor of All the President's Men and The Final Days comes this pained, loving, intensely felt account of his parents' ordeal, and his own emotional upheaval, during President Harry Truman's loyalty purges. Both of Bernstein's parents had Communist Party affiliations in the 1940s. His father, Al, a Senate-appointed investigative attorney on Capitol Hill, later a union leader in San Francisco, attended a few Party meetings; his mother, Sylvia, participated in the party's campaigns on behalf of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg and to desegregate swimming pools. When Truman's loyalty boards began passing judgment, in 1947, on government employees' fitness to serve, Al Bernstein was defense counsel in some 500 such cases. His own union career derailed, he opened a laundry. In 1954, his wife was called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. The FBI was a constant presence in their son's boyhood and adolescence. This taut memoir mingles pride, angry confrontation with the author's parents and coming to terms with the past. We also get unbuttoned glimpses of the author as fourth-grade "patriotic nut," Bar Mitzvah boy screaming at his "atheistic" mom and dad, brash fraternity leader in Maryland's suburbs, budding journalist.

A winner of the Romantic Novelists&#x2019; Association&#x2019;s Romantic Novel of the Year Award, Henry lives with her family in a village in North Devon, England.<b><br></b>***This excerpt is from an advance uncorrected copy proof*** <br><br>Copyright � 2017 Veronica Henry<br><br><p><b>Prologue</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>February 1983</i></p><p><i>He would never have believed it if you&#x2019;d told him a year ago. That he&#x2019;d be standing in an empty shop with a baby in a pram, seriously considering putting in an offer.</i></p><p><i>The pram had been a stroke of luck. He&#x2019;d seen an advert for a garden sale in a posh part of North Oxford, and the bargain hunter in him couldn&#x2019;t stay away. The couple had two very young children but were moving to Paris. The pram was pristine, of the kind the queen might have pushed&#x2014;or, rather, her nanny. The woman had wanted only five pounds for it. Julius was sure it was worth far more, and that she was only being kind. But if recent events had taught him one thing, it was to accept kindness. With alacrity, before people changed their minds. So he bought it and scrubbed it out carefully even though it had seemed very clean already, and bought a fresh mattress and blankets, and there he had it: the perfect nest for his precious cargo, until she could walk.</i></p><p><i>When did babies start to walk? There was no point in asking Debra&#x2014;his vague, away</i>-<i>with</i>-<i>the</i>-<i>fairies mother, ensconced in her patchouli</i>-<i>soaked basement flat in Westbourne Grove, whose memory of his own childhood was blurry.</i></p><p><i>According to Debra, Julius was reading by the age of two, a legend he didn&#x2019;t quite believe. Although maybe it was true, because he couldn&#x2019;t remember a time he couldn&#x2019;t read. It was like breathing to him. Nevertheless, he couldn&#x2019;t and didn&#x2019;t rely on his mother for child-rearing advice. He often thought it was a miracle he had made it through childhood unscathed. She used to leave him alone, in his cot, while she went to the wine bar on the corner in the evenings. &#x201c;What could go wrong?&#x201d; she asked him. &#x201c;I only left you for an hour.&#x201d; Perhaps that explained his protectiveness toward his own daughter. He found it hard to turn his back on her for even a moment.</i></p><p><i>He looked around the bare walls again. The smell of damp was inescapable, and damp would be a disaster. The staircase rising to the mezzanine was rotten, so rotten he wasn&#x2019;t allowed up it. The two bay windows on either side of the front door flooded the shop with a pearlescent light, highlighting the golden oak of the floorboards and the ornate plasterwork on the ceiling. The dust made it feel otherworldly: a ghost shop, waiting, waiting for something to happen, a transformation, a renovation, a renaissance.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;It was a pharmacy, originally,&#x201d; said the agent. &#x201c;And then an antiques shop. Well, I say antique&#x2014;you&#x2019;ve never seen so much rubbish in your life.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>He should get some professional advice, really. A structural survey, a quote from someone for any work needed</i>&#x2014;<i>yet Julius felt light</i>-<i>headed and his heart was pounding. It was right. He knew it was. The two floors above were ideal for him and the baby to live in. Over the shop.</i></p><p><i>The bookshop.</i></p><p><i>His search had begun three weeks earlier, when he had decided that he needed to take positive action if he and his daughter were going to have any semblance of a normal life together. He had looked at his experience, his potential, his assets, and the practicalities of being a single father, and decided there was really only one option open to him.</i></p><p><i>He&#x2019;d gone to the library, put a copy of the Yellow Pages on the table, and next to it a detailed map of the county. He drew a circle around Oxford with a fifteen</i>-<i>mile radius, wondering what it would be like to live in Christmas Common, or Ducklington, or Goosey: they sounded straight out of Beatrix Potter. Then he worked through all the bookshops listed and put a cross through the towns they were in.</i></p><p><i>He looked at the remaining towns, the ones without a bookshop at all. There were half a dozen. He made a list, and then over the next few days visited each one, traveling by a complicated timetable of buses. The first three had been soulless and dreary, and he was so discouraged he&#x2019;d almost given up on his idea, but something about the name Peasebrook pleased him, so he decided to try one more town before relinquishing his fantasy.</i></p><p><i>Peasebrook was in the middle of the Cotswolds, on the outer perimeter of the circle he had drawn, as far out as he wanted to go. He got off the bus and looked up the high street. It was wide and tree</i> <i>lined, its pavements flanked with higgledy-piggledy golden buildings. There were antiques shops, a traditional butcher with rabbit and pheasant hanging outside and fat sausages in the window, a sprawling inn and a couple of nice caf�s and a cheese shop. The Women&#x2019;s Institute was having a sale outside the town hall: there were trestle tables bearing big cakes oozing jam, and baskets of mud-covered vegetables and pots of herbaceous flowers drooping dark purple and yellow blooms.</i></p><p><i>Peasebrook was buzzing, in a quiet way but with purpose, like bees on a summer afternoon. People stopped in the street and talked to each other. The caf�s looked pleasingly full. The tills seemed to jangle: people were shopping with gusto and enthusiasm. There was a very smart restaurant with a bay tree outside the door and an impressive menu in a glass case boasting nouvelle cuisine. There was even a tiny theater showing </i>The Importance of Being Earnest<i>. Somehow that boded well. Julius loved Oscar Wilde. He&#x2019;d done one of his dissertations on him: &#x201c;The Influence of Oscar Wilde on W. B. Yeats.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>He took the play as a good omen, but he carried on scouring the streets, in case his research hadn&#x2019;t been thorough. He feared turning a corner and finding what he hoped wasn&#x2019;t there. Now that he was here, in Peasebrook, he wanted it to be his home</i>&#x2014;their <i>home. It was a mystery, though, why there was no bookshop in such an appealing place.</i></p><p><i>After all, a town without a bookshop was a town without a heart.</i></p><p><i>Julius imagined each person he passed as a potential customer. He could picture them all, crowding in, asking his advice, him sliding their purchases into a bag, getting to know their likes and dislikes, putting a book aside for a particular customer, knowing it would be just up their alley. Watching them browse, watching the joy of them discovering a new author, a new world.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Would the vendor take a cheeky offer?&#x201d; he asked the estate agent, who shrugged.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;You can ask.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;It needs a lot of work.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;That </i>has<i> been taken into consideration.&#x201d; Julius named his price.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my best and only offer. I can&#x2019;t afford any more.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>When Julius signed the contract four weeks later, he couldn&#x2019;t help but be amazed. Here he was, alone in the world (well, there was his mother, but she was as much use as a chocolate teapot) but for a baby and a bookshop. And as that very baby reached out her starfish hand, he gave her his finger to hold and thought: what an extraordinary position to be in. Fate was peculiar indeed.</i></p><p><i>What if he hadn&#x2019;t looked up at that very moment, nearly two years ago now? What if he had kept his back to the door and carried on rearranging the travel section, leaving his colleague to serve the girl with the Rossetti hair . . .</i></p><p><i>And six months later, after weeks of dust and grime and sawing and sweeping and painting, and several eye-watering bills, and a few moments of sheer panic, and any number of deliveries, the sign outside the shop was rehung, painted in navy and gold, proclaiming </i>Nightingale Books<i>. There had been no room to write </i>purveyors of reading matter to the discerning<i>, but that was what he was. A bookseller.</i></p><p><i>A bookseller of the very best kind.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>1</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Thirty-two years later . . .</i></p><p>What do you do, while you&#x2019;re waiting for someone to die? Literally, sitting next to them in a plastic armchair that isn&#x2019;t the right shape for <i>anyone&#x2019;s </i>bottom, waiting for them to draw their last breath because there is no more hope.</p><p>Nothing seemed appropriate. There was a room down the corridor for watching TV, but that seemed callous, and anyway, Emilia wasn&#x2019;t really a TV person.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t knit, or do needlepoint. Or sudoku.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t want to listen to music, for fear of disturbing him. Even the best earphones leak a certain timpani. Irritating on a train, probably even more so on your deathbed. She didn&#x2019;t want to surf the Internet on her phone. That seemed the ultimate in twenty-first-century rudeness.</p><p>And there wasn&#x2019;t a single book on the planet that could hold her attention right now.</p><p>So she sat next to his bed and dozed. And every now and then she started awake with a bolt of fear, in case she might have missed the moment. Then she would hold his hand for a few minutes. It was dry and cool and lay motionless in her clasp. Eventually it grew heavy and made her sad, so she laid it back on the top of the sheet.</p><p>Then she would doze off again.</p><p>From time to time the nurses brought her hot chocolate, although that was a misnomer. It was not hot, but tepid, and Emilia was fairly certain that no cocoa beans had been harmed in the making of it. It was pale beige, faintly sweet water.</p><p>The nighttime lights in the cottage hospital were dim, with a sickly yellowish tinge. The heating was on too high and the little room felt airless. She looked at the thin bedcover, with its pattern of orange and yellow flowers, and the outline of her father underneath, so still and small. She could see the few strands of hair curling over his scalp, leached of color. His thick hair had been one of his distinguishing features. He would rake his fingers through it while he was considering a recommendation, or when he was standing in front of one of the display tables trying to decide what to put on it, or when he was on the phone to a customer. It was as much a part of him as the pale blue cashmere scarf he insisted on wearing, wrapped twice round his neck, even though it bore evidence of moths. Emilia had dealt with them swiftly at the first sign. She suspected they had been brought in via the thick brown velvet coat she had bought at the charity shop last winter&#x2014;she could never resist a vintage bargain&#x2014; and she felt guilty they&#x2019;d set upon the one sartorial item her father seemed attached to.</p><p>He&#x2019;d been complaining then, of discomfort. Well, not complaining, because he wasn&#x2019;t one to moan. Emilia had expressed concern, and he had dismissed her concern with his trademark stoicism, and she had thought nothing more of it, just got on the plane to Hong Kong. Until the phone call, last week, calling her back.</p><p>&#x201c;I think you ought to come home,&#x201d; the nurse had said. &#x201c;Your father will be furious with me for calling you. He doesn&#x2019;t want to alarm you.&nbsp; But . . .&#x201d; The <i>but</i> said it all. Emilia was on the first flight out. And when she arrived Julius pretended to be cross, but the way he held her hand, tighter than tight, told her everything she needed to know.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s in denial,&#x201d; said the nurse. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a fighter, all right. I&#x2019;m so sorry. We&#x2019;re doing everything we can to keep him comfortable.&#x201d; Emilia nodded, finally understanding. Comfortable. Not alive.</p><p>Comfortable.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t seem to be in any pain or discomfort now. He had eaten some lime Jell-O the day before, eager for the quivering spoons of green. Emilia imagined it soothed his parched lips and dry tongue. She felt as if she was feeding a little bird as he stretched his neck to reach the spoon and opened his mouth. Afterward he lay back, exhausted by the effort. It was all he had eaten for days. All he was living on was a complicated cocktail of painkillers and sedatives that were rotated to provide the best palliative care. Emilia had come to hate the word <i>palliative</i>. It was ominous, and at times, she suspected, ineffectual. From time to time her father had shown distress, whether from pain or the knowledge of what was to come she couldn&#x2019;t be sure but she knew at those points the medication wasn&#x2019;t doing its job. Adjustment, although swiftly administered, never worked quickly enough. Which in turn caused her distress.</p><p>It was a never-ending cycle.</p><p>Yet not<i> never</i>-ending because it <i>would </i>end. The corner had been turned and there was no point in hoping for a recovery. Even the most optimistic believer in miracles would know that now. So there was nothing to do but pray for a swift and merciful release.</p><p>The nurse lifted the bedcover and looked at his feet, caressing them with gentle fingers. The look the nurse gave Emilia told her it wouldn&#x2019;t be long now.</p><p>His skin was pale gray, the pale gray of a marble statue.</p><p>The nurse dropped the sheet back down and rubbed Emilia&#x2019;s shoulder.</p><p>Then she left, for there was nothing she could say. It was a waiting game. They had done all they could. No pain, as far as anyone could surmise. A calm, quiet environment, for incipient death was treated with hushed reverence. But who was to say what the dying really wanted? Maybe he would prefer his beloved Elgar at full blast, or the shipping forecast on repeat? Or to hear the nurses gossiping and bantering, about whom they&#x2019;d been out with the night before and what they were cooking for tea? Maybe a distraction from your imminent demise by utter trivia would be a welcome one? Emilia sat and wondered how she could make him feel her love, as he slipped away. If she could take out her heart and give it to him, she would. This wonderful man who had given her life, and been her life, and was leaving her alone.</p><p>She&#x2019;d whispered to him, memories and reminiscences. She told him stories. Recited his favorite poems.</p><p>Talked to him about the shop.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to look after it for you,&#x201d; she told him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make sure it never closes its doors. Not in my lifetime. And I&#x2019;m never going to sell out to Ian Mendip, no matter what he offers, because the shop is all that matters. All the diamonds in the world are nothing in comparison. Books are more precious than jewels.&#x201d; She truly believed this. What did a diamond bring you? A momentary flash of brilliance. A diamond scintillated for a second; a book could scintillate forever.</p><p>She doubted Ian Mendip had ever read a book in his life. It made her so angry, thinking about the stress he&#x2019;d put her father under at a vulnerable time.</p><p>Julius had tried to underplay it, but she could see he was agitated, fearful for the shop and his staff and his customers. The staff had told her how unsettled he had been by it, and yet again she had cursed herself for being so far away. Now she was determined to reassure him, so he could slip away, safe in the knowledge that Nightingale Books was in good hands.</p><p>She shifted on the seat to find a more comfortable position. She ended up leaning forward and resting her head in her arms at the foot of the bed. She was unbelievably tired.</p><p>It was 2:49 in the morning when the nurse touched her on the shoulder. Her touch said everything that needed to be said. Emilia wasn&#x2019;t sure if she had been asleep or awake.

I am in full costume, backstage with the usual cast of characters. I bend down to give Emme and Max a kiss before my mom walks them off to watch the opening of the show. This was going to be the first time they&#x2019;d see their mommy perform in front of thousands and thousands of people. The last time I was on stage like this, they were in my belly.</p><p>As they walk away, Emme looks back and stops. I&#x2019;m being buckled into the rig on a twelve-by-twelve-inch platform. The huge, full-feather train of my white skirt pours over the edges and it must seem to her like I&#x2019;m standing in a cloud. She seems a little nervous, but excited. I&#x2019;m nervous, but controlling my fear. I&#x2019;m about to ascend sixty feet into the air. I know it&#x2019;s crazy, because the crew is watching with faces that say, <i>This is crazy!</i> I give the operator the thumbs-up; he gives me the thumbs-up in return&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and up I go, disappearing into the rafters until I am perched behind a huge video wall, where nobody can see me.</p><p>Emme looks up, watching me rise and rise and rise&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. From my perspective, everybody looks like little ants on the floor. I take a deep breath and think about the past year, all the hard work and the hard lessons that have led to this moment.</p><p>If I let myself, I could go weak in the knees. But I don&#x2019;t. I hold strong as the band plays the dramatic intro while the opening movie plays on the screen. And when the video wall splits open, I&#x2019;m standing there, a hundred feet above the audience, and the crowd goes wild. The spotlight hits me, and in my best old Hollywood voice I say: &#x201c;HELLO, LOVERS.&#x201d;</p><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�</p><p>In this book I&#x2019;m going to take you on the physical and emotional journey of the year I went on the first world tour of my career. The year that changed my life.</p><p>When I started planning the tour, I knew it was going to be the anchor for a very personal show. What I didn&#x2019;t expect was how cathartic it would end up being for me. The process of building the tour and performing it each and every night for audiences around the world helped me get back to who I am&#x2014;someone who sings, who dances, who expresses herself and connects with people through music.</p><p>So many times I wanted to abandon writing this book because I knew it would be a difficult process, delving into the past and reliving some of my darkest moments. Also, I didn&#x2019;t want to be misread. I didn&#x2019;t want anything to overshadow the magnificence of this great journey. This book is not a detailed account of any of my relationships, famous or not. This is not a &#x201c;tell-all,&#x201d; so I hope that&#x2019;s not what you&#x2019;re looking for. But by the end, I think you&#x2019;ll agree, you&#x2019;ll have gotten so much more. This book is about a series of patterns that go back as early as my childhood. This book is about <i>my</i> path and what <i>I</i> learned. It&#x2019;s the story of a transformative journey where I faced some of my greatest challenges, overcame some of my biggest fears, and emerged a stronger person than I&#x2019;ve ever been. This is the story of how I discovered&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the truest love of all.</p><p>My genuine intention and what I hope to accomplish with this book is that others can draw upon the experiences that changed the course of my life and find encouragement in the mantra that motivated the following pages:</p><p>You will live.</p><p>You will love.</p><p>You will <i>dance again&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>I</p><p></p><p>I wake up in bed alone. The silence in my room reminds me of the emptiness in my heart. I failed at love&#x2014;again. Except this time, it wasn&#x2019;t just me. I am haunted by the inescapable thought that I let down my beautiful babies, Max and Emme. I wanted so badly for things to have turned out differently.</p><p>As lonely as this bed feels, I can&#x2019;t bring myself to get out of it.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>ROCK BOTTOM</p><p>HITTING ROCK BOTTOM</p><p>I remember the exact moment when everything changed. I was in the desert outside Los Angeles, getting ready for a photo shoot.</p><p>It was a beautiful day in July 2011, and Marc and I had just celebrated our seventh wedding anniversary. Anybody looking from the outside in would have thought my life was going great: I had a husband and two beautiful children, and my career was flying high. I was on <i>American Idol</i>, the number-one show on the planet, and my new single &#x201c;On the Floor&#x201d; had gone to number one all over the world. To top it off, <i>People</i> magazine had named me their very first Most Beautiful Woman in the World, a few months earlier. How could life get any better?</p><p>What people didn&#x2019;t know was that life really <i>wasn&#x2019;t</i> that good. My relationship was falling apart, and I was terrified.</p><p>And now here I was out in the desert, getting made up for a L&#x2019;Or�al shoot. I had done hundreds of these before&#x2014;you sit in the chair, get your hair and face made up, go out in front of the camera, and do your thing. But this day didn&#x2019;t feel like any other day.</p><p>As I sat there, my mind was racing. My heart was beating out of my chest, and I felt like I couldn&#x2019;t breathe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I became consumed with fear and anxiety. <i>What was happening to me?</i></p><p>My mom, Guadalupe, who lives in New York and happened to be in town that week, came to the desert with me that day, and my dear manager, Benny Medina, was there too. As I found myself in a panic, I leaped from my chair and said, &#x201c;Benny, something is happening! I feel like I&#x2019;m going crazy.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the end, the truth finds a way to surface, even if you don&#x2019;t want it to.</p><p>Benny, who has been through so much with me over the fifteen years we have worked together and been friends, took my hands.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, now, what&#x2019;s happening? What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>My mom rushed to my side, too, a look of concern on her face.</p><p>All I could say was, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I don&#x2019;t feel right. I&#x2019;m scared. I feel like I&#x2019;m losing my mind.&#x201d;</p><p>He tried to calm me down, saying, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re fine, Jennifer. You&#x2019;re good. Everything&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d; To him I looked completely calm. But I wasn&#x2019;t. It was one of those moments when you&#x2019;re so scared you can&#x2019;t even scream. It feels as if you&#x2019;re paralyzed.</p><p>We as human beings do this thing where we stuff down our feelings until they find a way to manifest themselves. We try to avoid them until there&#x2019;s no more room and they come bubbling up like a pot of boiling-hot water that overflows. And when it does, it burns, and it&#x2019;s scary. That&#x2019;s what was happening to me.</p><p>In a blur of fear and panic, I looked at Benny and my mother and blurted out the words: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I can be with Marc anymore.&#x201d; Then I burst into tears.</p><p>It was out.</p><p>The one thing I feared more than anything in the world. The one thing I had been trying for so long not to face. Deep down, I knew that nothing would ever be the same again.</p><p>I collapsed into their arms and began to sob. And like that pot of boiling-hot water, once it overflows, the pressure is released and it begins to cool down. All those crazy thoughts started to melt away because I had finally given voice to the real reason for my fear and panic. I knew what it meant to say those words out loud: It meant the end of my marriage. The end of our family. The end of the dream I had worked so hard to hold together.</p><p>And it meant more than that. It meant that once again I was going to be judged. I was going to be ridiculed, chastised, and mocked. I could already see the headlines: &#x201c;Jennifer Lopez Headed for Divorce&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Again!&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;The Woman Who Has Everything But Can&#x2019;t Get Love Right!&#x201d; I was so scared to have another failure, to be scrutinized by the world, and to disappoint everyone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. again.</p><p>But this time wasn&#x2019;t like any other time. It was worse. This divorce wouldn&#x2019;t affect just Marc and me. It would affect these two beautiful little souls we had brought into the world. I was devastated at the thought of hurting Max and Emme. I was afraid that I was about to ruin their lives, that someday they would resent me for not being able to keep this marriage together.</p><p>As I struggled with the idea of breaking up my family, I had to consider what was best for my kids in the long run, and I agonized over what would serve them best in life. I was pulled in both directions, which is why I had fought so hard against admitting the inevitable. I <i>couldn&#x2019;t</i> admit that this marriage was over. But in the end, the truth finds a way to surface, even if you don&#x2019;t want it to. That day in the desert, with my brain going wild trying to deny reality, I had finally hit rock bottom.</p><p>HOPE FOR A BETTER DAY</p><p>On Christmas day in 2010, seven months before that L&#x2019;Or�al photo shoot, we had a house full of people. Marc was there, and Emme and Max, and Marc&#x2019;s other kids, Ryan and Cristian, Arianna and Alex, as well as our parents, siblings, and friends. It was the kind of Christmas gathering I&#x2019;d always wanted to have: a big, sprawling affair with our family at the center of it.</p><p>The house was filled with food and gifts and laughter, and that afternoon, twenty-four of us sat down to a beautiful Christmas dinner. Things between Marc and me weren&#x2019;t perfect, of course&#x2014;our marriage was never the kind to glide along peacefully. From the beginning, it was tumultuous, passionate, and explosive, but we also shared many fulfilling and joyful moments. I knew we had problems, but we loved each other and we were trying, and I wanted more than anything to have a family&#x2014;<i>this </i>family. So I was willing to ignore whatever wasn&#x2019;t going well, for the greater good of preserving it.</p><p>I thought that Christmas was exactly what I wanted. I thought we were finally getting it right, that it was worth putting up with the difficulties because this was what life was about. Every marriage has its challenges, but it was about keeping that marriage together, having that family unit, and making the dream come true&#x2014;whatever the cost. Part of that concept still holds true for me: Family is most important.</p><p>But the very next Christmas, twelve months later, I was waking up alone. The only people in the house were Max, Emme, and my cousin Tiana, who had come to keep me company. My mother and my sisters, Lynda and Leslie, had decided to stay in New York for the holidays, and they had asked me to come out, but I didn&#x2019;t want to go. I wanted to be in my own home, as empty as it now felt.</p><p>I cried a lot that Christmas, though I tried to let the tears flow only when the kids couldn&#x2019;t see me. There&#x2019;s nothing like the holidays to make you feel a loss, and I was really feeling it. But then my dad, David, came over for Christmas dinner, and Benny came and brought his mom. So with Emme, Max, and everyone else, we had a pretty full table&#x2014;even if it wasn&#x2019;t as full as the one we had the year before.</p><p>What I will always remember about that Christmas is not the tears or the loneliness, but the toast that Benny gave.</p><p></p></p><h2>Lisey&#39;s Story</h2><p>Hodder edition paperback fine condition. In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p>Since his first novel was published in 1974, Stephen King has stretched the boundaries of the written word, not only bringing horror to new heights, but trying his hand at nearly every possible genre, including children's books, graphic novels, serial novels, literary fiction, nonfiction, westerns, fantasy, and even e-books (remember The Plant?). With <i>Lisey's Story</i>, once again King is trying something different. <i>Lisey's Story</i> is as much a romance as it is a supernatural thriller--but don't let us convince you. Who better to tell readers if King has written a romantic thriller than Nora Roberts? We asked Nora to read <i>Lisey's Story</i> and give us her take. Check out her review below. <i>--Daphne Durham</i><br><p> </p><strong>Guest Reviewer: Nora Roberts</strong><br><br><b>Nora Roberts, who also writes under the pseudonym J.D. Robb, is the author of way too many bestselling books to name here (over 150!), but some of our favorites include: <i>Angels Fall</i>, <i>Born in Death</i>, <i>Blue Smoke</i>, and <i>The Reef</i>.</b> <br><br> Stephen King hooked me about three decades ago with that sharply faceted, blood-stained jewel, <i>The Shining</i>. Through the years he's bumped my gooses with kiddie vampires, tingled my spine with beloved pets gone rabid, justified my personal fear of clowns and made me think twice about my cell phone. I've always considered <i>The Stand</i>--a long-time favorite--a towering tour de force, and have owed its author a debt as this was the first novel I could convince my older son to read from cover to cover.<p> But with <i>Lisey's Story</i>, King has accomplished one more feat. He broke my heart.</p><p> <i>Lisey's Story</i> is, at its core, a love story--heart-wrenching, passionate, terrifying and tender. It is the multi-layered and expertly crafted tale of a twenty-five year marriage, and a widow's journey through grief, through discovery and--this is King, after all--through a nightmare scape of the ordinary and extraordinary. Through Lisey's mind and heart, the reader is pulled into the intimacies of her marriage to bestselling novelist Scott Landon, and through her we come to know this complicated, troubled and heroic man.</p><p> Two years after his death, Lisey sorts through her husband's papers and her own shrouded memories. Following the clues Scott left her and her own instincts, she embarks on a journey that risks both her life and her sanity. She will face Scott's demons as well as her own, traveling into the past and into Boo'ya Moon, the seductive and terrifying world he'd shown her. There lives the power to heal, and the power to destroy.</p><p> Lisey Landon is a richly wrought character of charm and complexity, of realized inner strength and redoubtable humor. As the central figure she drives the story, and the story is so vividly textured, the reader will draw in the perfumed air of Boo'ya Moon, will see the sunlight flood through the windows of the Scott's studio--or the night press against them. Her voice will be clear in your ear as you experience the fear and the wonder. If your heart doesn't hitch at the demons she faces in this world and the other, if it doesn't thrill at her courage and endurance, you're going to need to check with a cardiologist, first chance.</p><p> <i>Lisey's Story</i> is bright and brilliant. It's dark and desperate. While I'll always consider <i>The Shining</i>, my first ride on King's wild Tilt-A-Whirl, a gorgeous, bloody jewel, I found, on this latest ride, a treasure box heaped with dazzling gems.</p><p> A few of them have sharp, hungry teeth. <i>--Nora Roberts</i> </p><br>Stephen King is the author of more than&nbsp;fifty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(co-written with his son Owen King),&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>, the short story collection&nbsp;<i>The Bazaar of Bad Dreams</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and now an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series),&nbsp;<i>Doctor Sleep</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Under&nbsp;the Dome</i>.

H. R. Haldeman kept a diary of events while he served as Chief of Staff, from Nixon&#39;s inauguration to his resignation. Robert Foxworth narrates the entries of the first two years. He captures Haldeman&#39;s terse, unemotional writing style with his clear, crisp delivery. Haldeman&#39;s own voice, which he began to record in December 1970, chronicles his observations from that point. Although background noises, static and volume fluctuations make it difficult to understand what Haldeman is saying, listening to history from one who helped shape it is worthwhile. Foxworth&#39;s frequent interjections to clarify events and provide follow-up information are welcome features. A.A.B. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineThese diaries landed immediately on the best-seller list after their publication (no prepub galleys were available for review). Historians, however, won't extract much beyond daily reminders of Nixon's bark-off persona, especially his habit of airing all options, from the ludicrous to the realistic. Chief of Staff Haldeman was the PR guy, the scheduler, the enforcer (the lord high executioner, Nixon once said) who, though totally trustworthy as a sounding board for his boss, was a nonsubstantive decision maker. Haldeman dramatically tells, for example, of the August 1971 demolition of the world financial system without exhibiting much understanding of the economic ramifications. At bottom, Haldeman's diary is another thimbleful poured into the huge vat of Nixonia; however, the book's juicy quotations (such as those <i>Nightline</i> ran) boost interest dramatically. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Maximum Bob</h2><p>Skirt-chasing, orchid-raising Florida judge &#34;Maximum&#34; Bob Gibbs has made a career of oversentencing convicted felons. He&#39;s thrown the book at so many that it&#39;s beginning to look like one of them may be planning to throw it back at him. But assassination isn&#39;t the worst of the judge&#39;s problems. He&#39;s got to get his whacked-out wife Leanne out of Palm Beach--fast. For it seems she&#39;s becoming an embarrassment, what with her multiple personalities and all. So when Bob starts playing footsie with an alligator poacher in a scam to scare his wife into divorce, and a pretty probation officer named Kathy Diaz Baker catches his lecherous eye, things really start to heat up in south Florida...as bullets start flying, a gator comes crawling, and a lovely lady finds herself in a cross fire of smart crooks, foolish love, and sweet revenge.</p><p><p>Hard-ass Palm Beach County judge Bob Isom Gibbs enjoys sending even petty offenders away to do hard time -- which has made the list of miscreants who want him dead longer than a fully grown Florida gator's tail. And a good number of his illwishers are probation officer Kathy Baker's clients, including young Dale Crowe and his psycho uncle Elvin. Now, Kathy's got an even more daunting task than keeping BIG's horny hands off her: keeping "Maximum Bob" alive. Because Gibbs's many enemies seem to be willing to go to any lengths -- be it death by amphibian or some more tried-and-true method -- to permanently end the career of an oversexed, racist jurist who's more interested in scoring than in saving his own red neck.</p><p>Elmore Leonard wrote more than forty books during his long career, including the bestsellers <em>Raylan</em>, <em>Tishomingo Blues</em>, <em>Be Cool</em>, <em>Get Shorty</em>, and <em>Rum Punch</em>, as well as the acclaimed collection <em>When the Women Come Out to Dance</em>, which was a <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book.

James St. James was there when the killer confessed, but before that, there were the clubs, the parties, the drugs, and the many fabulous (and some not so fabulous) outfits. <i>Disco Bloodbath</i> is "celebutante" St. James's story, equal parts confession and attempt at closure. This is no square-jawed detective's account of the investigation of the crime; St. James is a drug-addled clubster who wears a wedding dress out on the town and invokes Judy Garland as he talks about the scene in which he and Melendez immersed themselves before the murder. His story, despite its gruesome subject matter and frequent, shocking lucidity, has a chatty and anecdotal quality that's compelling, endearing, and unrelentingly human. <i>--Lisa Higgins</i><b>James St. James</b> who was once dubbed a "celebutante" by <i>Newsweek</i> magazine, now leads a quiet, sedate existence in Los Angeles, far from the madness that he writes about.

All of them survived the Holocaust: Shayndel, a Polish Zionist; Leonie, a Parisian beauty; Tedi, a hidden Dutch Jew; and Zorah, a concentration camp survivor.

The tossing and whimpering are over. Even the insomniacs have settled down. The twenty restless bodies rest, and faces aged by hunger, grief, and doubt relax to reveal the beauty and the pity of their youth. Not one of the women in Barrack C is twenty-one, but all of them are orphans.<br> <br>Their cheeks press against small, military-issue pillows that smell of disinfectant. Lumpy and flat from long service under heavier heads, they bear no resemblance to the goose-down clouds that many of them enjoyed in childhood. And yet, the girls burrow into them with perfect contentment, embracing them like teddy bears. There were no pillows for them in the other barracks. No one gives a pillow to an animal.<br> <br>The British built Atlit in 1938 to house their own troops. It was one in a group of bases, garages, and storage units set up on the coastal plains a few miles south of Haifa. But at the end of the world war, as European Jews began making their way to the ancestral homeland in violation of international political agreements, the mandate in Palestine became ever messier. Which is how it came to pass that Atlit was turned into a prison or, in the language of command, a &#x201c;detention center&#x201d; for refugees without permissory papers. The English arrested thousands as illegal immigrants, sent most of them to Atlit, but quickly set them free, like fish too small to fry.<br> <br>It was a perfectly forgettable compound of wooden barracks and buildings set out in rows on a scant square acre surrounded by weeds and potato fields. But the place offered a grim welcome to the exhausted remnant of the Final Solution, who could barely see past its barbwire fences, three of them, in fact, concentric lines that scrawled a crabbed and painful hieroglyphic across the sky.<br> <br>Not half a mile to the west of Atlit, the Mediterranean breaks against a rocky shore. When the surf is high, you can hear the stones hiss and sigh in the tidal wash. On the eastern horizon, the foothills of the Carmel reach heavenward, in keeping with their name, kerem-el, &#x201c;the vineyard of God.&#x201d; Sometimes, the candles of a village are visible in the high distance, but not at this hour. The night is too old for that now.<br> <br>It is cool in the mountains but hot and damp in Atlit. The overhead lights throb and buzz in the moist air, heavy as a blanket. Nothing moves. Even the sentries in the guard towers are snoring, lulled by the stillness and sapped, like their prisoners, by the cumulative weight of the heat.<br> <br>There are no politics in this waning hour of the night, no regret, no delay, no waiting. All of that will return with the sun. The waiting is worse than the heat. Everyone who is locked up in Atlit waits for an answer to the same questions: When will I get out of here? When will the past be over?<br> <br>There are only 170 prisoners in Atlit tonight, and fewer than seventy women in all. It is the same lopsided ratio on the chaotic roads of Poland and Germany, France and Italy; the same in the train stations and the Displaced Persons camps, in queues for water, identification cards, shoes, information. The same quotient, too, in the creaking, leaky boats that secretly ferry survivors into Palestine.<br> <br>There is no mystery to this arithmetic. According to Nazi calculation, males produced more value alive than dead&#x2014;if only marginally, if only temporarily. So they killed the women faster.<br> <br>In Barrack C, the corrugated roof releases the last degrees of yesterday&#x2019;s sun, warming the blouses and skirts that hang like ghosts from the rafters. There are burlap sacks suspended there as well, lumpy with random, rescued treasures: photograph albums, books, candlesticks, wooden bowls, broken toys, tablecloths, precious debris.<br> <br>The narrow cots are lined up unevenly against the naked wood walls.

On the kibbutz among the pine trees high in the Carmel, dairymen are rubbing their eyes and pulling on their boots.<br> <br>In Atlit, the women sleep. Nothing disturbs them. No one notices the soft stirring of a breeze, the blessing of the last, gentlest chapter of the day.<br> <br>It would be a kindness to prolong this peace and let them rest a bit longer.

He had two hours before the van&#x2019;s owner would come out of the movies and discover his loss, but he needed only half an hour.<br>Twenty-five minutes later, he drove into the little town, and five minutes after that, he pulled the van into the large steel shed behind his business. Half a dozen men, who had been sitting around a poker table, stood up and walked over.<br>&#x201c;Looks good,&#x201d; one of them said.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll do. Only 48K on the clock, and it runs like a sewing machine. Let&#x2019;s do it.&#x201d;<br>Everybody went to work. First, they donned rubber gloves, then they washed the van thoroughly and cleaned the interior, and fastened two rough wooden benches to the floor. Two men unrolled a large decal and affixed it to the side of the van. Environmental Services, Inc., it read, and in smaller letters, Cleaning up after the world. There was a phone number, too. If anyone rang it, they&#x2019;d get a pizzeria on U.S. 1. They fixed an identical decal to the opposite side of the van, then changed the license plates, tossing the old ones into the van.<br>Somebody looked under the hood, fiddled with a couple of things, then closed it. &#x201c;Good shape,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The man knows how to take care of a vehicle.&#x201d; He checked a sticker on the windshield. &#x201c;Had it serviced last week; nice of him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I hope his insurance is paid up,&#x201d; someone else said.<br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; their leader said, &#x201c;let&#x2019;s go over it again.&#x201d; The poker chips and cards were removed from the big round table, and a large floor plan was spread out. &#x201c;Number two,&#x201d; the leader said, &#x201c;take us through it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We all know it by heart,&#x201d; somebody said.<br>&#x201c;You will when I&#x2019;m finished,&#x201d; the leader said. &#x201c;Then you can all get a good night&#x2019;s sleep.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>When the van was ready they went home and left him alone in the shed. He went to an elongated safe in a corner, tapped the combination into the keypad, and opened it. He removed six Remington riot guns&#x2014;12-gauge pump shotguns with 18�-inch barrels, normally used for police work&#x2014;and took them to the van, laying them on the floor. He went to a &nbsp;locker and removed six blue jumpsuits&#x2014;all the same size&#x2014;took them to the van and put one where each man would sit. Back to the locker to find six yellow construction hard hats, six dust masks and six pairs of tinted safety goggles, which he laid neatly on top of the jumpsuits. He then laid a shotgun on each seat, and placed a box of double-aught shells and a pair of latex surgical gloves beside each shotgun. Finally, he went back to the gun safe, removed six 9mm semiautomatic handguns and boxes of ammunition and distributed them inside the van. The weapons had been bought, one at a time, at gun shows or from unlicensed dealers, then stripped, inspected and, if necessary, repaired. Before reassembly, each part of each weapon had been washed clean with denatured alcohol and oiled. There would be no fingerprints or DNA samples on them.<br>When he was done, he sat down at the table, stripped off his gloves and poured himself a drink from a bottle of bourbon. He looked at the newspaper clipping again. Eleven o&#x2019;clock at the courthouse. &#x201c;Happy occasion,&#x201d; he said aloud to himself. &#x201c;And oh so convenient.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Two</b><br><br>HOLLY BARKER OPENED HER EYES AND FELT FOR Jackson. His side of the bed was empty, and she could hear the shower running. She moved her hand to the warm place on her stomach and found Daisy&#x2019;s head. She scratched behind an ear and was answered with a small sigh. Daisy was a Doberman pinscher, and she liked to sleep with her head on Holly&#x2019;s belly.<br>Holly heard the shower turn off and, a moment later, Jackson&#x2019;s bare feet padding across the bedroom carpet. She raised her head, tucked a pillow under it and eyed him&#x2014;naked, wet hair, in a hurry. She liked him naked.<br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;where am I going on my honeymoon?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Same place as I am,&#x201d; Jackson replied, stepping into his boxer shorts and selecting a white shirt from a drawer.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m relieved to hear it,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And where is that?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Someplace you&#x2019;ll probably like,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Probably&nbsp;like? You&#x2019;re not even&nbsp;sure&nbsp;I&#x2019;m going to like it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&nbsp;think&nbsp;you will,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but, in the immortal words of Fats Waller, &#x2018;One never knows, do one?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>&#x201c;This is how you treat your wife?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a wife.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You will by high noon, or my daddy will shoot you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ham wouldn&#x2019;t shoot me; he&#x2019;s too nice a guy.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He would, if he knew you wouldn&#x2019;t tell me where I&#x2019;m going on my honeymoon.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&nbsp;knows, and that&#x2019;s enough for Ham.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wait a minute,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;My&nbsp;father&nbsp;knows where I&#x2019;m going on my honeymoon, and your wife doesn&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I told you, I don&#x2019;t have a wife.&#x201d;<br>She sat up on one elbow, and the sheet fell away from her breasts. &#x201c;How will I know what to pack?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You packed yesterday,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and I told you what to pack, remember?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Men never know what to pack. What if you screw up?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just have to take that chance.&#x201d; He pulled on his trousers, found a necktie and started to tie it.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re driving me crazy,&#x201d; she said, falling back onto the pillow.<br>&#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t pull that sheet over your breasts, you&#x2019;re going to drive me crazy,&#x201d; he replied, looking at her in the mirror.<br>She kicked the sheet completely off, disturbing Daisy&#x2019;s sleep. &#x201c;Take that,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;I intend to,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;when we arrive in . . . whatchacallit.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why are you rushing off ?&#x201d; she asked seductively.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t point that thing at me,&#x201d; Jackson said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a closing in half an hour, then I have to do some dictating before I leave the office and then, on the way to the courthouse, I have to pick up the tickets at the travel agent&#x2019;s and stop at the bank for some travelers&#x2019; checks.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you have the tickets sent here?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&#x201c;Because you would have ripped them open to find out where you&#x2019;re going on your honeymoon.&#x201d;<br>He had her there. She fumed.<br>He slipped into his suit jacket, adjusted his tie, came to the bed and bent over her.<br>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you dry your hair?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put the top down.&#x201d; He kissed her on one nipple, then the other.<br>She giggled. &#x201c;Sure the closing can wait a few minutes.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Would you muss my wedding dress?&#x201d; he asked. That was how he referred to the white linen suit he had had made for the occasion.<br>&#x201c;No, you&#x2019;re too beautiful.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Tell you what, if you&#x2019;ll call yourself Mrs. Oxenhandler for the rest of your life, I&#x2019;ll tell you where you&#x2019;re going on your honeymoon.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jackson, I keep telling you:&nbsp;nobody&nbsp;would&nbsp;choose&nbsp;&nbsp;to be called Mrs. Oxenhandler. You&#x2019;re stuck, you were born with it. Can you imagine my cops calling me Chief Oxenhandler? They couldn&#x2019;t keep a straight face.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I think that&#x2019;s a very dignified name for a chief of police,&#x201d; Jackson said, trying to look hurt.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a very dignified name for someone who handles oxen,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he sighed, &#x201c;I guess you&#x2019;ll find out where you&#x2019;re going on your honeymoon when you get there.&#x201d;<br>She pulled the sheet over her head. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t even tell me&nbsp;then!&#x201d; she cried. She pulled down the sheet again, and he was standing in the bedroom doorway, looking splendid in his new suit.<br>&#x201c;See you at the courthouse,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;In Judge Chandler&#x2019;s courtroom, and you&#x2019;d better be there early!&#x201d; she called after him. She fell back on the bed. She would always remember that picture of him, standing in the doorway in his white linen suit and gold tie, with his hair still wet.<br>Holly got out of bed, brushed her teeth and got into the shower, reaching for the shampoo. She had let her hair grow, and it was nearly down to her &nbsp;shoulders, though she wore it up when she was in uniform, which was most of the time. She was allowing herself two hours for the process&#x2014;washing, rolling and drying her hair, putting on a little makeup, which she rarely wore, and getting into the short white sheath that would be her wedding dress.<br>Daisy lay on the bathroom mat, watching her through the clear glass shower door, waiting patiently for her breakfast and to be let out. Holly laughed. Daisy would be her maid of honor; Holly had trained her to carry the bouquet all the way to the front of the courtroom before handing it to her. Daisy could do anything.<br>Holly felt that she could do anything, too. She was bursting with happiness and expectation and with trying to figure out where Jackson was taking her on her honeymoon.<br>She got out of the shower and called her office&#x2019;s direct line.<br>&#x201c;Chief Barker&#x2019;s office,&#x201d; her secretary and office manager, Helen Tubman, said.<br>&#x201c;Hi, it&#x2019;s me.

Lord Peter Wimsey could imagine the artist stepping back, the stagger, the fall, down to where the pointed rocks grinned like teeth. But was it an accident - or murder? Six members of the close-knit Galloway artists&#39; colony do not regret Campbell&#39;s death. Five of them are red herrings.</p><p><p><em>Lord Peter Wimsey must ferret out a murderer in a Scottish art colony in this classic tale from Dorothy L. Sayers.</em></p><p>In the scenic Scottish village of Kirkcudbright, no one is disliked more than the painter Sandy Campbell. When he is found dead at the foot of a cliff, his easel standing above, no one is sorry to see him gone&#x2014;especially six members of the close-knit Galloway artists' colony.</p><p>The inimitable Lord Peter Wimsey is on the scene to determine the truth about Campbell's death. Piecing together the evidence, the aristocratic sleuth discovers that of the six suspected painters, five are red herrings, innocent of the crime. But just which one is the ingenious artist with a talent for murder?</p>Dorothy L Sayers was born in Oxford in 1893, and was both a classical scholar and a graduate in modern languages. As well as her popular Lord Peter Wimsey series, she wrote several religious plays, but considered her translations of Dante&#39;s Divina Commedia to be her best work. She died in 1957.</p><h2>Dirk Pitt Revealed</h2><p><b>Clive Cussler is an extraordinary author whose life parallels that of his fictional hero, Dirk Pitt.

The guard studied the pass that was extended by a hand from the rear window, then handed it back and spoke in an official tone. "Stay on the road. You're in a restricted area."<br><br>The driver swung onto the narrow service road that ran parallel with the east-west taxi strip on the southern border of the airport. "You sure this is the right way?" he asked, seeing nothing but an empty field.<br><br>"I'm certain," answered the gray-haired man in the backseat. "I've been here before."<br><br>"May I ask what you're looking for?"<br><br>The man in the backseat ignored the question. "Pull up at that pole with the red light on the top. I'll get out there."<br><br>"But there's no sign of life."<br><br>"Can you return for me in about forty minutes?"<br><br>"You want to stand out here in the middle of nowhere on a cold night for forty minutes?" asked the uncomprehending driver.<br><br>"I enjoy solitude."<br><br>The cabbie shrugged his shoulders. "OK. I'll take a break for a cup of coffee and come back for you in forty minutes."<br><br>The man passed the driver a fifty-dollar bill and stepped from the cab. He stood in the middle of the road beside the pole until the red taillights of the cab faded in the distance. Then he stared at a ghostly building that seemed to materialize out of the night, its silhouette becoming defined against the lights of the nation's capital across the Potomac River. Slowly, the building became physical and recognizable as an old aircraft hangar with a rounded roof. At first glance it appeared deserted. The surrounding land was covered with weeds, and the corrugated sides of the building wore a heavy coat of rust. The windows were boarded over, and the huge doors that once rolled open to admit aircraft for maintenance were welded closed.<br><br>The man standing in the road was not alone, and the hangar was not abandoned. At least two dozen cars were neatly parked in rows among the weeds. As he watched, a Lincoln Town Car pulled up to the front entrance door of the hangar, and an elegantly dressed woman exited the car, her door held open by a valet parking attendant.<br><br>As the man approached, he could hear the sound of voices mingled with laughter and the music of a Dixieland jazz band blaring out "Waiting for the <i>Robert E. Lee.</i>" Before he made his way to the entrance, the man with the mane of gray hair and matching beard paused for a moment, listening to the wave of conversation from inside. Finally, he stepped through the doorway and handed his overcoat to a girl who gave him his receipt. A doorman, dressed suavely in a tuxedo, came forward.<br><br>"May I have your invitation, sir?"<br><br>The gray-haired man looked at him and said with quiet authority, "I do not require one."<br><br>The doorman's face went blank for a moment, and then, as if realizing his mistake, he said, "My apologies, sir. Please enjoy the party."<br><br>Then the intruder passed into a scene that he had envisioned in his mind a hundred times and that could only be described in a novel.<br><br>Row upon row of beautifully restored classic cars were positioned across a vast white epoxy-sealed floor. Their gleaming mirrorlike paint seemed to fluoresce under the brilliant overhead lights mounted on the girders in the rounded roof. A German jet from World War II and an old 1930s Ford Trimotor passenger aircraft stood parked in the far corner of the hangar. Next to them sat an early-twentieth-century railroad Pullman car and what looked like a small sailboat put together by either a small child or a drunk. The man smiled as he examined a bathtub with an outboard motor that sat on a small platform.<br><br>Hanging from the girders and along the walls were antique metal signs advertising gasoline brands, car manufacturers, and soft drinks, many of them no longer in existence. Several red signs with white lettering hung in a row, one after the other, that read, HE HAD THE RING. HE HAD THE FLAT. BUT SHE FELT HIS CHIN. AND THAT WAS THAT. <i>BURMA SHAVE.</i><br><br>In another corner of the cavernous hangar an ornate iron circular staircase wound up to an apartment above the main floor where the host lived. The intruder did not make his way up the stairs. Not just yet. There was no curiosity. He already knew every square inch of the apartment in his mind.<br><br>Tables arranged in the aisles between the cars were already filled with people conversing as they drank California estate reserve wine or French champagne<br>and dined on the gourmet delicacies from several buffet tables stationed in a circle around an enormous ice sculpture of a Mississippi steamboat that rose from a sea of blue ice with a mist swirling around its paddle wheels. The buffet table featured polished silver chafing dishes and iced platters kept filled with seafood of every variety by a small army of waiters and<br>chefs.<br><br>The body of the man hovering around the serving lines was nothing less than colossal. He did not look happy. He was dabbing sweat from his brow and neck as he admonished the ma�tre d' of Le Curcel, the Michelin three-star restaurant he had hired to cater the party. "These oysters you sent over are the size of peanuts. They simply won't do."<br><br>"I shall have them replaced within minutes," the ma�tre d' promised before rushing away.<br><br>"You are St. Julien Perlmutter." It was a statement, not a question, from the gray-haired man.<br><br>"Yes, I am. May I be of service to you, sir?"<br><br>"Not really, but I've always been envious of your lifestyle. A gourmand, a true connoisseur of the finer things, the nation's leading maritime history expert. It can safely be said that you're not a common man."<br><br>Perlmutter patted his ample stomach. "There are, however, a few disadvantages to loving good food and drink."<br><br>"Speaking of food and drink, may I express my compliments on arranging such an elaborate party? The food and wine selection and table settings are beyond compare."<br><br>Perlmutter's face lit up. "I accept your gracious compliment, Mr...."<br><br>But the stranger did not answer. He had already turned and began wandering amid the party guests. Unnoticed and unrecognized, he made his way to the bar and waited in line behind a pair of lovely ladies who ordered two glasses of Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Brut champagne. One was tall, very tall, with blond hair that was almost yellow. She stared from a strong face with high cheekbones and through deep blue eyes. The other woman was smaller, with radiant red hair and gray eyes. She had an exotic quality about her.<br><br>"I beg your pardon," he said, looking at the redhead, "but you must be Summer Moran." He shifted his head slightly. "And you are Maeve Fletcher."<br><br>arBoth women instinctively looked at each other and then at the stranger. "Do we know you?" Maeve inquired.<br><br>"Not in a physical sense, no."<br><br>"But you recognize us," said Summer.<br><br>"I guess you could say that I'm familiar with your existence."<br><br>Maeve stared at him and smiled thinly. "Then you must know that Summer and I are dead."<br><br>"Yes, I'm quite aware of that. You both died in the Pacific Ocean," he said slowly. "Ms. Moran in an underwater earthquake and Ms. Fletcher from the<br>eruption of twin volcanoes. I regret things couldn't have worked out differently."<br><br>"Could events have been altered for a happier ending?" asked Summer.<br><br>"They might have."<br><br>Maeve stared over her champagne glass at him. "This is eerie."<br><br>Summer gave the man a calculating look. "Do you think Maeve and I might ever be resurrected?"<br><br>"I rarely speculate on future events," answered the man. "But I'd have to say the prospects are dim."<br><br>"Then it's not likely we'll ever meet again."<br><br>"No, I'm afraid not."<br><br>He stood aside as the ladies excused themselves. He watched them move with a feline poise as they made their way through the crowded hangar and thought it was a great pity that he was seeing them for the last time. He stared at Summer and began to have second thoughts.<br><br>The bartender broke his reverie. "Your pleasure, sir?"<br><br>"What brand of tequila are you pouring?"<br><br>"Patron and Porfido."<br><br>"Your host has excellent taste," said the stranger. "However, I would like a double Don Julio anejo on the rocks with lime and a salted rim."<br><br>The bartender looked at him thoughtfully. "Don Julio is Mr. Pitt's personal favorite. It's also his private stock. Very little of it is exported from Mexico."<br><br>"He won't mind. You might say he drinks it because of me."<br><br>The bartender shrugged and poured the tequila from a bottle hidden beneath the bar. The intruder thanked him and stepped to a nearby table where several attractive women were seated engaged in girl talk.<br><br>"I guess we should consider ourselves lucky," said Eva Rojas, a pretty, vibrant woman with red-gold hair. "Unlike Summer and Maeve, we survived to the end of our adventures."<br><br>Jessie LeBaron, refined and lithe-bodied in her midfifties, patted her lips with a napkin. "True, but except for Heidi Milligan and Loren Smith, the rest of us never reappeared."<br><br>The exquisite Julia Lee, her Chinese features soft and delicate, recalled, "After Dirk and I returned from Mazatlan, Mexico, we both went back to our respective jobs, and I never saw him again."<br><br>"At least you enjoyed an exotic and romantic interlude with him," said Stacy Fox, brushing aside the blond strands of hair from her face. "In my case, he didn't even say good-bye."<br><br>Hali Kamil, a lovely woman with classic Egyptian features, laughed. "Isn't this where somebody says it is better to have loved and lost Dirk Pitt than never to have loved him at all?"<br><br>Lily Sharp, striking and svelte, and the captivating Dana Seagram sat quietly, not speaking, their minds far away, Lily remembering when she and Pitt found the treasures from the Alexandria Library in Texas, Dana when she worked with him raising the <i>Titanic.</i><br><br>"It wouldn't be practical for Pitt to have married any of you," said the gray-haired man, breaking into the conversation.<br><br>"Why do you say that?" asked Julia Lee as the women all turned and stared openly at the stranger.<br><br>"Can you picture Al Giordino coming to your front door and asking if Pitt can come out and play? I'm afraid the scenario would not be acceptable."<br><br>Then he smiled and abruptly walked away.<br><br>"Who was that?" Dana Seagram asked no one in particular.<br><br>"Beats me," replied Lily Sharp. "Nobody I've ever met before."<br><br>The party crasher strolled over to a dark metallic blue 1936 Pierce-Arrow sedan that was attached to a matching trailer. A group of men sat next to the trailer. The stranger peered inside at the linoleum floor, the antique stove and icebox. He appeared to be studying the trailer's interior but was in fact listening to the table conversation with more than a passing interest.<br><br>A tall, distinguished-looking man who spoke with a German accent pointed across the table to a muscular bull of a man with a clean-shaven head. "Foss Gly here was surely the worst of us all," said Bruno von Till.<br><br>A wealthy-looking Chinese man shook his head in disagreement. "My vote goes to Min Koryo Bougainville. For a woman, she made the rest of us villains look like milksops."<br><br>Min Koryo, though frail and ancient, still had eyes that burned with evil. "Thank you, Qin Shang. But it cost me a horrible death. If you recall, I was sent hurtling down the elevator shaft of the World Trade Center from the hundredth floor."<br><br>Arthur Dorsett, as ugly as any man created, grinned through yellow teeth. "Consider yourself lucky. After Pitt crushed my throat, he left me to be consumed by molten lava."<br><br>Foss Gly spread his huge hands expansively. "After beating me with a baseball bat, he jammed his finger in my eye socket clear through to my brain."<br><br>Tupac Amaru, the Peruvian terrorist, scoffed. "At least he didn't shoot off your genitals before killing you in total darkness deep in an underwater cave."<br><br>Yves Massarde, immaculately dressed in a white dinner jacket with a yellow rose in the lapel, stared vacantly into the bubbles rising in his champagne glass and wondered aloud, "How could Pitt be even more brutal and vicious than the worst crew of villains ever created?"<br><br>The gray-haired stranger leaned between Gly and Qin Shang and said, "It was easy."<br><br>Before any of the men could say a word, he quickly resumed his course through the partygoers, moving toward the far wall where an old railroad Pullman car sat on a short section of track leading to nowhere. The gold lettering on the steel sides read MANHATTAN LIMITED. The lights inside had been wired into the main junction box, and the opulent interior was as brightly lit as when the car rolled over the tracks between New York and Quebec. Mannequins were artfully arranged in what was once called the parlor. At one table two men sat as if dining while a porter in a white uniform stood and served.<br><br>A distinguished, impeccably dressed man in his seventies sat in a Victorian velvet chair. Next to him on the couch was an attractive woman half his age with ash-blond hair. She wore the uniform of a naval officer, and despite the fact that she was sitting down, it was easy to imagine her standing at a height of six feet.<br><br>ard"I'm sitting in the very same chair where Pitt bounced a bullet off my head," said the elderly man with a British inflection.<br><br>"Does he still call you Brian Shaw?" asked Heidi Milligan.<br><br>"Yes, but I'm certain he saw right through me."<br><br>"He never stopped suspecting you of being James Bond," said Heidi.<br><br>The older man reached over, took Heidi's hand, and kissed it.

"That's antisocial."<br><br>Hiram Yaeger looked up at the stranger standing in the fuselage entrance. One of the overhead lights was above and to the rear of his visitor, and he squinted while attempting to recognize the face of the man who spoke. The stranger was tall, nearly six feet, three inches, with a slight paunch brought about by age. His hair had grayed over the years, as had the beard covering only his chin. His skin was tanned from the sun. He was probably in his middle sixties, Yaeger estimated, but he looked younger. The stranger wore a faint grin on his lips, but it was his eyes that gripped Yaeger's attention. They were a mysterious blue-green with a light that twinkled from deep inside. The face was that of a man who might have been a ship's captain in a past life, or a prospector, maybe even an explorer.<br><br>"Dirk asked me to look up data on a lost ship," Yaeger finally explained.

When an Egyptian library invites her to visit as a consultant, her jealous sister Judith persuades her to go. But in Egypt&#x2019;s postrevolutionary chaos, Josie is abducted&#x2015;leaving Judith free to take over Josie&#x2019;s life at home, including her husband and daughter, while Josie&#x2019;s talent for preserving memories becomes a surprising test of her empathy and her only means of escape. <p>A century earlier, another traveler arrives in Egypt: Solomon Schechter, a Cambridge professor hunting for a medieval archive hidden in a Cairo synagogue. Both he and Josie are haunted by the work of the medieval philosopher Moses Maimonides, a doctor and rationalist who sought to reconcile faith and science, destiny and free will. But what Schechter finds, as he tracks down the remnants of a thousand-year-old community&#x2019;s once-vibrant life, will reveal the power and perils of what Josie&#x2019;s ingenious work brings into being: a world where nothing is ever forgotten.</p><p>An engrossing adventure that intertwines stories from Genesis, medieval philosophy, and the digital frontier, <em>A Guide for the Perplexed</em> is a novel of profound inner meaning and astonishing imagination.</p></p><p>Dara Horn is a two-time winner of the National Jewish Book Award for Fiction and one of Granta&#x2019;s Best American Novelists.

She introduces us to botanists around the world, as well as places where hope for plants can be found, such as The Millennium Seed Bank. She shows us the secret world of plants with all their mysteries and potential for healing our bodies as well as Planet Earth.<br><br> Looking at the world as an adventurer, scientist, and devotee of sustainable foods and gardening--and setting forth simple goals we can all take to protect the plants around us--Goodall delivers an enlightening story of the wonders we can find in our own backyards.</p><p>Jane Goodall is the world's foremost authority on chimpanzees. An internationally renowned conservationist, she is the founder of the Jane Goodall Institute and has received many distinguished awards in science. Dr. Goodall is also the author of many acclaimed books, including the bestseller <em>Reason for Hope.</em><br>*Starred Review* Though Goodall is known everywhere as the chimpanzee expert who transformed our understanding of primates and ourselves, it comes as no surprise that her profound love of nature and vigorous global activism extend to the plant kingdom. Goodall begins this tribute to the glory of plants and trees and protest against their endangerment with memories of her grandmother&#x2019;s English country home, where her best friend was a large, cradling beech. She also shares her reverence for the forests of Gombe that nurture chimpanzees. In this far-ranging, gracefully impassioned book, Goodall, aided by frequent coauthor Hudson, shares her fascination with the beingness of plants, from the miracles of seeds to photosynthesis and astonishing strategies of seed dispersal, pollination, defense, and communication. She writes of her mystical experiences with trees, obsessive and daring plant hunters, orchid fever, and the deep psychological benefits of gardening. Goodall celebrates the long history of medicinal plants and decries corporate biopiracy and exposes the horrendous human suffering and environmental damage wrought by today&#x2019;s cotton industry and the disastrous consequences of genetically modified crops. Appalled by the ongoing destruction of forests, Goodall finds seeds of hope in those who work to protect the green world, upon which we are utterly dependent. A crucial and commanding summons to care and act by one of nature&#x2019;s most heroic champions. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Somebody Is Going to Die if Lilly Beth Doesn&#39;t Catch That Bouquet: The Official Southern Ladies&#39; Guide to Hosting the Perfect Wedding</h2><p><strong>Even if youve never attended a wedding in the South, youll find laughter in the pages of this deliciously entertaining slice of Southern life and love, complete with recipes, advice, and a huge dose of that famous charm</strong><p>"In the Mississippi Delta, funerals bring out the best in people, while weddings, which are supposed to be happy occasions, bring out the worst."

Her fierce, sometimes comic novels and stories reflected the darkly funny, vibrant, and theologically sophisticated woman who wrote them. Brad Gooch brings to life O'Connor's significant friendships--with Robert Lowell, Elizabeth Hardwick, Walker Percy, and James Dickey among others--and her deeply felt convictions, as expressed in her communications with Thomas Merton, Elizabeth Bishop, and Betty Hester. Hester was famously known as "A" in O'Connor's collected letters, <em>The Habit of Being</em>, and a large cache of correspondence to her from O'Connor was made available to scholars, including Brad Gooch, in 2006. O'Connor's capacity to live fully--despite the chronic disease that eventually confined her to her mother's farm in Georgia--is illuminated in this engaging and authoritative biography.<br><br>PRAISE FOR FLANNERY<br><br>"Flannery O'Connor, one of the best American writers of short fiction, has found her ideal biographer in Brad Gooch. With elegance and fairness, Gooch deals with the sensitive areas of race and religion in O'Connor's life. He also takes us back to those heady days after the war when O'Connor studied creative writing at Iowa. There is much that is new in this book, but, more important, everything is presented in a strong, clear light." --Edmund White<br><br>"This splendid biography gives us no saint or martyr but the story of a gifted and complicated woman, bent on making the best of the difficult hand fate has dealt her, whether it is with grit and humor or with an abiding desire to make palpable to readers the terrible mystery of God's grace." --Frances Kiernan, author of <i>Seeing Mary Plain</i>: <i>A Life of Mary McCarthy <br></i><br>"A good biographer is hard to find.

Charles &amp; others</p><p></p><h2>Crazy Like Us: The Globalization of the American Psyche</h2><p>It is well known that American culture is a dominant force at home and abroad; our exportation of everything from movies to junk food is a well-documented phenomenon. But is it possible America's most troubling impact on the globalizing world has yet to be accounted for? In <i>Crazy Like Us</i>, Ethan Watters reveals that the most devastating consequence of the spread of American culture has not been our golden arches or our bomb craters but our bulldozing of the human psyche itself: We are in the process of homogenizing the way the world goes mad. <p> America has been the world leader in generating new mental health treatments and modern theories of the human psyche. We export our psychopharmaceuticals packaged with the certainty that our biomedical knowledge will relieve the suffering and stigma of mental illness. We categorize disorders, thereby defining mental illness and health, and then parade these seemingly scientific certainties in front of the world. The blowback from these efforts is just now coming to light: It turns out that we have not only been changing the way the world talks about and treats mental illness -- we have been changing the mental illnesses themselves. </p><p> For millennia, local beliefs in different cultures have shaped the experience of mental illness into endless varieties.<i> Crazy Like Us</i> documents how American interventions have discounted and worked to change those indigenous beliefs, often at a dizzying rate. Over the last decades, mental illnesses popularized in America have been spreading across the globe with the speed of contagious diseases. Watters travels from China to Tanzania to bring home the unsettling conclusion that the virus is us: As we introduce Americanized ways of treating mental illnesses, we are in fact spreading the diseases. </p><p> In post-tsunami Sri Lanka, Watters reports on the Western trauma counselors who, in their rush to help, inadvertently trampled local expressions of grief, suffering, and healing. In Hong Kong, he retraces the last steps of the teenager whose death sparked an epidemic of the American version of anorexia nervosa. Watters reveals the truth about a multi-million-dollar campaign by one of the world's biggest drug companies to change the Japanese experience of depression -- literally marketing the disease along with the drug. </p><p> But this book is not just about the damage we've caused in faraway places. Looking at our impact on the psyches of people in other cultures is a gut check, a way of forcing ourselves to take a fresh look at our own beliefs about mental health and healing. When we examine our assumptions from a farther shore, we begin to understand how our own culture constantly shapes and sometimes creates the mental illnesses of our time. By setting aside our role as the world's therapist, we may come to accept that we have as much to learn from other cultures' beliefs about the mind as we have to teach.</p></p><p>Ethan Watters is the author of <i>Urban Tribes</i>, an examination of the mores of the "never-marrieds," and the coauthor of <i>Making Monsters</i>, a groundbreaking indictment of the recovered memory movement. A frequent contributor to <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>Discover</i>, <i>Men's Journal</i>, <i>Wired</i>, and This American Life, he lives in San Francisco with his wife and children.&nbsp;<p><b><b>Introduction</b><br></b></p><p>To travel internationally is to become increasingly unnerved by the way American culture pervades the world. We cringe at the new indoor Mlimani shopping mall in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We shake our heads at the sight of a McDonald&#x2019;s on Tiananmen Square or a Nike factory in Malaysia. The visual landscape of the world has become depressingly familiar. For Americans the old joke has become bizarrely true: wherever we go, there we are.</p><p>We have the uneasy feeling that our influence over the rest of the world is coming at a great cost: loss of the world&#x2019;s diversity and complexity. For all our self-incrimination, however, we have yet to face our most disturbing effect on the rest of the world. Our golden arches do not represent our most troubling impact on other cultures; rather, it is how we are flattening the landscape of the human psyche itself. We are engaged in the grand project of Americanizing the world&#x2019;s understanding of the human mind.</p><p>This might seem like an impossible claim to back up, as such a change would be happening inside the conscious and unconscious thoughts of more than six billion people. But there are telltale signs that have recently become unmistakable. Particularly telling are the changing manifestations of mental illnesses around the world. In the past two decades, for instance, eating disorders have risen in Hong Kong and are now spreading to inland China. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become the common diagnosis, the lingua franca of human suffering, following wars and natural disasters. In addition, a particularly Americanized version of depression is on the rise in countries across the world.</p><p>What is the pathogen that has led to these outbreaks and epidemics? On what currents do these illnesses travel?</p><p>The premise of this book is that the virus is us.</p><p>Over the past thirty years, we Americans have been industriously exporting our ideas about mental illness. Our definitions and treatments have become the international standards. Although this has often been done with the best of intentions, we&#x2019;ve failed to foresee the full impact of these efforts. It turns out that how a people in a culture think about mental illnesses&#x2014;how they categorize and prioritize the symptoms, attempt to heal them, and set expectations for their course and outcome&#x2014;influences the diseases themselves. In teaching the rest of the world to think like us, we have been, for better and worse, homogenizing the way the world goes mad.</p><p>There is now a remarkable body of research that suggests that mental illnesses are not, as sometimes assumed, spread evenly around the globe. They have appeared in different cultures in endlessly complex and unique forms. Indonesian men have been known to experience <i>amok</i>, in which a minor social insult launches an extended period of brooding punctuated by an episode of murderous rage. Southeastern Asian males sometimes suffer from <i>koro</i>, the debilitating certainty that their genitals are retracting into their body. Across the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East there is <i>zar,</i> a mental illness related to spirit possession that brings forth dissociative episodes of crying, laughing, shouting, and singing.</p><p>The diversity that can be found across cultures can be seen across time as well. Because the troubled mind has been perceived in terms of diverse religious, scientific, and social beliefs of discrete cultures, the forms of madness from one place and time in history often look remarkably different from the forms of madness in another. These differing forms of mental illness can sometimes appear and disappear within a generation. In his book <i>Mad Travelers,</i> Ian Hacking documents the fleeting appearance in Victorian Europe of a fugue state in which young men would walk in a trance for hundreds of miles. Symptoms of mental illnesses are the lightning in the zeitgeist, the product of culture and belief in specific times and specific places. That thousands of upper-class women in the mid-nineteenth century couldn&#x2019;t get out of bed due to the onset of hysterical leg paralysis gives us a visceral understanding of the restrictions set on women&#x2019;s social roles at the time.</p><p>But with the increasing speed of globalization, something has changed. The remarkable diversity once seen among different cultures&#x2019; conceptions of madness is rapidly disappearing. A few mental illnesses identified and popularized in the United States&#x2014;depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anorexia among them&#x2014;now appear to be spreading across cultural boundaries and around the world with the speed of contagious diseases. Indigenous forms of mental illness and healing are being bulldozed by disease categories and treatments made in the USA.</p><p>There is no doubt that the Western mental health profession has had a remarkable global influence over the meaning and treatment of mental illness. Mental health professionals trained in the West, and in the United States in particular, create the official categories of mental diseases. The American Psychiatric Association&#x2019;s <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>, the <i>DSM</i> (the &#x201c;bible&#x201d; of the profession, as it is sometimes called), has become the worldwide standard. In addition American researchers and organizations run the premier scholarly journals and host top conferences in the fields of psychology and psychiatry. Western universities train the world&#x2019;s most influential clinicians and academics. Western drug companies dole out the funds for research and spend billions marketing medications for mental illnesses. Western-trained traumatologists rush in wherever war or natural disasters strike to deliver &#x201c;psychological first aid,&#x201d; bringing with them their assumptions about how the mind becomes broken and how it is best healed.</p><p>These ideas and practices represent much more than the symptom lists that describe these conditions. Behind the promotion of Western ideas of mental health and healing lies a variety of cultural assumptions about human nature itself. Westerners share, for instance, beliefs about what type of life event is likely to make one psychologically traumatized, and we agree that venting emotions by talking is more healthy than stoic silence. We are certain that humans are innately fragile and should consider many emotional experiences as illnesses that require professional intervention. We&#x2019;re confident that our biomedical approach to mental illness will reduce stigma for the sufferer and that our drugs are the best that science has to offer. We promise people in other cultures that mental health (and a modern style of self-awareness) can be found by throwing off traditional social roles and engaging in individualistic quests of introspection. These Western ideas of the mind are proving as seductive to the rest of the world as fast food and rap music, and we are spreading them with speed and vigor.</p><p>What motivates us in this global effort to convince the world to think like us? There are several answers to this question, but one of them is quite simple: drug company profits. These multibillion-dollar conglomerates have an incentive to promote universal disease categories because they can make fortunes selling the drugs that purport to cure those illnesses.</p><p>Other reasons are more complex. Many modern mental health practitioners and researchers believe that the science behind our drugs, our illness categories, and our theories of the mind have put the field beyond the influence of constantly shifting cultural trends and beliefs. After all, we now have machines that can literally watch the mind at work. We can change the chemistry of the brain in a variety of ways and examine DNA sequences for abnormalities. For a generation now we have proudly promoted the biomedical notion of mental illness: the idea that these diseases should be understood clinically and scientifically, like physical illnesses. The assumption is that these remarkable scientific advances have allowed modern-day practitioners to avoid the biases and mistakes of their predecessors.</p><p>Indeed modern-day mental health practitioners often look back at previous generations of psychiatrists with a mixture of scorn and pity, wondering how they could have been so swept away by the cultural beliefs of their time. Theories surrounding the epidemic of hysterical women in the Victorian era are now dismissed as cultural artifacts. Even recent iatrogenic contagions, such as the sudden rise of multiple personality disorder just fifteen years ago, are considered ancient history, harmful detours but safely in the past. Similarly, illnesses found only in other cultures are often treated like carnival sideshows. <i>Koro</i> and <i>amok</i> and the like can be found far back in the American diagnostic manual (<i>DSM-IV</i>, pages 845&#x2014;849) under the heading &#x201c;Culture-Bound Syndromes.&#x201d; They might as well be labeled &#x201c;Psychiatric Exotica: Two Bits a Gander.&#x201d;</p><p>Western mental health practitioners are prone to believe that, unlike those culturally contrived manifestations of mental illness, the 844 pages of the <i>DSM-IV</i> prior to the inclusion of culture-bound syndromes describe <i>real</i> disorders of the mind, illnesses with symptomatology and outcomes relatively unaffected by shifting cultural beliefs. And, the logic goes, if they are unaffected by culture, then these disorders are surely universal to humans everywhere. Their application around the world therefore represents simply the brave march of scientific knowledge.</p><p>But the cross-cultural researchers and anthropologists profiled in this book have a different story to tell. They have shown that the experience of mental illness cannot be separated from culture. We can become psychologically unhinged for many reasons, such as personal trauma, social upheaval, or a chemical imbalance in our brain. Whatever the cause, we invariably rely on cultural beliefs and stories to understand what is happening. Those stories, whether they tell of sp...</p></p><h2>Heaven in Stone and Glass: Experiencing the Spirituality of the Great Cathedrals</h2><p>In this book, Robert Barron takes readers on a spiritual pilgrimage through the greatest wonders of the Christian world.</p><p>Barron's mission is much the same as John Drury's in <i>Painting the Word</i> [BKL D 15 99]: to open a window on the symbolism of Christian art. Whereas Drury aimed to enrich appreciation of paintings, Barron unveils the symbolism of those triumphs of the art of Christendom, the Gothic cathedrals. Exemplifying primarily from Notre-Dame de Paris and Chartres, he discusses 14 features of a cathedral, including space, light, and orientation (e.g., the verticality of every major line in the building), as well as tangible features, such as the rose windows and the labyrinth on the floor at Chartres. Besides what a feature symbolizes--for instance, the cathedral's interior space represents the womb of Our Lady, a place of safety and comfort--Barron explains the doctrinal rationale and implications of the feature's significance. He does the latter so literately and congenially that the little book makes fine devotional as well as informational reading. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i>Barron, a priest and professor at Mundelein Seminary, has produced a deeply personal and deeply engaging guide to the experience of the medieval or medieval-style cathedral. His is not a scholarly treatment but rather a kind of staged walk around the cathedral with the reader, drawing spiritual sustenance from the features of the building: stillness from the Rose Window, sense of the inhabited cosmos from the tympana, and so forth. Barron's treatment is direct and even vulnerable but not naive: he acknowledges the painful ambiguities of the presence of Jewish prophets in the cathedral's sculptures and makes reference to figures as au courant as John Lennon and Alasdair Macintyre.

Angell's famous explorations of the summer game are built on acute observation and joyful participation, conveyed in a prose style as admired and envied as Ted Williams's swing. Angell on Fenway Park in September, on Bob Gibson brooding in retirement, on Tom Seaver in mid-windup, on the abysmal early and recent Mets, on a scout at work in back-country Kentucky, on Pete Rose and Willie Mays and Pedro Martinez, on the astounding Barry Bonds at Pac Bell Park, and more, carry us through the arc of the season with refreshed understanding and pleasure.

The collection spans the forty-plus years of Angell&#x2019;s baseball writing career and includes many of his favorite pieces as well as never-before-published material. <p> Rather than stringing the selections together chronologically, the book's editor, Steve Kettmann, groups them by the three seasons of the game&#x2014;spring, summer, fall. The structure works well to expose the breadth and depth of Angell&#x2019;s writing across the years. As Richard Ford promises in the introduction, "It is by getting those. . . baseball essentials (strategies, nuances, protocols) down onto the page, and cementing the hard foundation without which sporstswriting can&#x2019;t earn your time away from the game itself, that Angell has made his bones."</p><p> The downside of this approach, however, is that some selections feel dated or misplaced for readers who did not live through the seasons in question. Many of the rookies scouted or players traded have long since faded into the obscurity. And for essays like "Distance," which profiles pitcher Bob Gibson, placement in "Summer" seems forced, the piece beginning as it does with recollection of Gibson&#x2019;s seventeen strikeout record set in the 1968 World Series. </p><p> But these are faults to be expected in a collection that represent the vastness of Angell&#x2019;s contribution to baseball.

How does it move us, inform us, challenge us? Internationally renowned painter David Salle&#x2019;s incisive essay collection illuminates the work of many of the most influential artists of the twentieth century.

Chaput, author of <i>Living the Catholic Faith</i> and <i>Render unto Caesar</i> comes <i>Strangers in a Strange Land</i>, a fresh, urgent, and ultimately hopeful treatise on the state of Catholicism and Christianity in the United States. America today is different <i>in kind,</i> not just in degree, from the past. And this new reality is unlikely to be reversed. The reasons include, but aren't limited to, economic changes that widen the gulf between rich and poor; problems in the content and execution of the education system; the decline of traditional religious belief among young people; the shift from organized religion among adults to unbelief or individualized spiritualities; changes in legal theory and erosion in respect for civil and natural law; significant demographic shifts; profound new patterns in sexual behavior and identity; the growth of federal power and its disregard for religious rights; the growing isolation and elitism of the leadership classes; and the decline of a sustaining sense of family and community.</p></p><p><b>Archbishop Charles J. Chaput, OFM Cap.</b>, was named archbishop of Philadelphia in 2011 by Pope Benedict XVI. As a member of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, he was the second Native American to be ordained a bishop in the United States and is the first Native American archbishop. Chaput is the author of <i>Living the Catholic Faith: Rediscovering the Basics </i>and <i>Render unto Caesar: Serving the Nation by Living Our Catholic Beliefs in Political Life</i>&#x2015;as well as numerous articles and public talks.<p>"Erudite and eloquent...his book should be read by serious-minded people of whatever religious, partisan or intellectual inclination."<b><i>&#x2015;The Wall Street Journal</i></b></p><p>"<i>Strangers in a Strange Land</i> is a thought-provoking depiction of a complex contemporary scene. As he fills in his canvas, the author cites a wide variety of sources: magisterial documents and Church Fathers (especially Augustine), historical figures, contemporary ethicists and social scientists, and even poets. Yet throughout the book Chaput is much more than a cultural commentator; he is a pastor instructing souls. Although his message is challenging, the tone is always civil, conversational rather than controversial, and never preachy. In a non-academic way, with remarkable clarity and gentle wit, the author offers remedial lessons in Catholic morality and social doctrine for generations."<b><i>&#x2015;Catholic World Report</i></b><br><i><b></b></i><br>&#x201c;Christians often disagree about how that hope shouldmanifest itself in our public and cultural engagements.

Chaput trenchantly explores what the Church must be and how it must behave within the context of a post-Christian culture. Drawing on figures as diverse as Tocqueville, Newman, Benedict XVI, MacIntyre, and the ancient author of the <i>Letter to Diognetus,</i> he argues, not that the Church should withdraw from the world, but that it should function as light and leaven within the world.

Studded with observations from some of the most provocative thinkers of the past century, <i>Strangers in a Strange Land</i> explores the complex trajectory of American political and social thought. With 'going along to get along' no longer an option, Chaput challenges us to ask ourselves: Do we really believe in God or not? Are we really on fire with a love for Jesus Christ or not? For the author, living the truth with hope and joy is our one sure path forward.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>Greg Erlandson, editor in chief of<i> Catholic News Service</i></b></p><p>"Every believer in a position of authority over other citizens needs to read <i>Strangers in a Strange Land,</i> but so too does every Christian who is wondering what is happening and, crucially, how they ought to live in this new world . . .

Huston Smith, tirelessly working to promote cross-cultural religious and spiritual tolerance. Richard Alpert, a.k.a. Ram Dass, inspiring generations with his mantra, &#x201c;be here now.&#x201d; Andrew Weil, undisputed leader of the holistic medicine revolution. And, of course, Timothy Leary, the charismatic, rebellious counter-culture icon and LSD guru. Journalist Don Lattin provides the funny, moving inside story of the &#x201c;Cambridge Quartet,&#x201d; who crossed paths with the infamous Harvard Psilocybin Project in the early 60&#x2019;s, and went on to pioneer the Mind/Body/Spirit movement that would popularize yoga, vegetarianism, and Eastern mysticism in the Western world. </p></p><p><p>This book is the story of how three brilliant scholars and one ambitious freshman crossed paths in the early sixties at a Harvard-sponsored psychedelic-drug research project, transforming their lives and American culture and launching the mind/body/spirit movement that inspired the explosion of yoga classes, organic produce, and alternative medicine.</p><p>The four men came together in a time of upheaval and experimentation, and their exploration of an expanded consciousness set the stage for the social, spiritual, sexual, and psychological revolution of the 1960s. Timothy Leary would be the rebellious trickster, the premier proponent of the therapeutic and spiritual benefits of LSD, advising a generation to "turn on, tune in, and drop out." Richard Alpert would be the seeker, traveling to India and returning to America as Ram Dass, reborn as a spiritual leader with his "Be Here Now" mantra, inspiring a restless army of spiritual pilgrims. Huston Smith would be the teacher, practicing every world religion, introducing the Dalai Lama to the West, and educating generations of Americans to adopt a more tolerant, inclusive attitude toward other cultures' beliefs. And young Andrew Weil would be the healer, becoming the undisputed leader of alternative medicine, devoting his life to the holistic reformation of the American health care system.</p><p>It was meant to be a time of joy, of peace, and of love, but behind the scenes lurked backstabbing, jealousy, and outright betrayal. In spite of their personal conflicts, the members of the Harvard Psychedelic Club would forever change the way Americans view religion and practice medicine, and the very way we look at body and soul.</p><p>Don Lattin is one of the nation's leading journalists covering alternative and mainstream religious movements and figures in America.

In "The Mud Below," a rodeo rider's obsession marks the deepening fissures between his family life and self-imposed isolation. In "The Half-Skinned Steer," an elderly fool drives west to the ranch he grew up on for his brother's funeral, and dies a mile from home. In "Brokeback Mountain," the difficult affair between two cowboys survives everything but the world's violent intolerance. <br> <br> These are stories of desperation, hard times, and unlikely elation, set in a landscape both brutal and magnificent. Enlivened by folk tales, flights of fancy, and details of ranch and rural work, they juxtapose Wyoming's traditional character and attitudes -- confrontation of tough problems, prejudice, persistence in the face of difficulty -- with the more benign values of the new west. <br> <br> Stories in <i>Close Range</i> have appeared in <i>The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly, Harper's,</i> and <i>GQ.</i> They have been selected for the <i>O. Henry Stories 1998</i> and <i>The Best American Short Stories of the Century</i> and have won the National Magazine Award for Fiction. This is work by an author writing at the peak of her craft.</p><p>With the very first sentence of the first story in this remarkable collection, Annie Proulx demonstrates what makes her great: images sharp as paper cuts conveyed in language so imaginative and compressed it's just this side of poetry; a sense of character so specific it takes only a sentence to establish a whole life; and the underlying promise of something utterly unexpected waiting just up ahead.<p> </p><blockquote> In the long unfurling of his life, from tight-wound kid hustler in a wool suit riding the train out of Cheyenne to geriatric limper in this spooled-out year, Mero had kicked down thoughts of the place where he began, a so-called ranch on strange ground at the south hinge of the Big Horns. </blockquote> "The Half-Skinned Steer" chronicles elderly Mero Corn's journey back to Wyoming for his brother's funeral. As he drives west, details of his eventful trip are interspersed with recollections of his youth on the ranch--most notably a tall tale he heard told long ago about a sad-sack rancher named Tin Head and a butchered steer. This is vintage Proulx, a combination of isolated landscapes, macabre events, and damaged people that adds up, in the end, to a near-perfect story. It's no surprise that "The Half-Skinned Steer" made it into John Updike's <i>Best American Short Stories of the Century</i>.<p> Proulx achieves similar results with many of the other stories in <i>Close Range</i>, including another prizewinner, "Brokeback Mountain," the bittersweet story of doomed love between two cowboys who "can't hardly be decent together," yet know "if we do that in the wrong place we'll be dead." But Proulx is careful to add some leavening to the mix. In "The Blood Bay" she indulges her taste for the gruesome with a morbidly amusing retelling of an Old West shaggy-dog story, while "Pair a Spurs" is the sad-funny rendering of divorce, Wyoming style. The author is a true original in every sense of the word, and her evocation of the West is as singular and surprising as that of Cormac McCarthy or Ivan Doig. <i>Close Range</i> is Proulx at her best. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Annie Proulx's masterful language and fierce love of Wyoming are evident in this collection of stories about loneliness, quick violence, and wrong kinds of love.

He studied in Berlin and Vienna and was first known as a poet and translator, then as a biographer. Between the wars, Zweig was an international bestseller with a string of hugely popular novellas including Letter from an Unknown Woman, Amok and Fear. In 1934, with the rise of Nazism, he left Austria, and lived in London, Bath and New York-a period during which he produced his most celebrated works: his only novel, Beware of Pity, and his memoir, The World of Yesterday. He eventually settled in Brazil, where in 1942 he and his wife were found dead in an apparent double suicide. Much of his work is available from Pushkin Press. Wes Anderson&#39;s films include Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic, The Darjeeling Limited, Fantastic Mr Fox, and Moonrise Kingdom. He directed and wrote the screenplay for The Grand Budapest Hotel.The World of Yesterday is one of the greatest memoirs of the twentieth century, as perfect in its evocation of the world Zweig loved, as it is in its portrayal of how that world was destroyed. -- David Hare Beware of Pity is the most exciting book I have ever read...a feverish, fascinating novel -- Antony Beevor One of the joys of recent years is the translation into English of Stefan Zweig&#39;s stories. -- Edmund de Waal, author of The Hare with the Amber Eyes I defy anyone to read these tasters of Zweig&#39;s work without being compelled to read on.

Mild-mannered Oxford scholar John Ronald Reuel Tolkien had little inkling when he published <i>The Hobbit; Or, There and Back Again</i> in 1937 that, once hobbits were unleashed upon the world, there would be no turning back. Hobbits are, of course, small, furry creatures who love nothing better than a leisurely life quite free from adventure. But in that first novel and the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the hobbits Bilbo and Frodo and their elvish friends get swept up into a mighty conflict with the dragon Smaug, the dark lord Sauron (who owes much to proud Satan in <i>Paradise Lost</i>), the monstrous Gollum, the Cracks of Doom, and the awful power of the magical Ring. The four books' characters--good and evil--are recognizably human, and the realism is deepened by the magnificent detail of the vast parallel world Tolkien devised, inspired partly by his influential Anglo-Saxon scholarship and his Christian beliefs. (He disapproved of the relative sparseness of detail in the comparable allegorical fantasy his friend C.S. Lewis dreamed up in <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>, though he knew Lewis had spun a page-turning yarn.) It has been estimated that one-tenth of all paperbacks sold can trace their ancestry to J.R.R. Tolkien. But even if we had never gotten Robert Jordan's <i>The Path of Daggers</i> and the whole fantasy genre Tolkien inadvertently created by bringing the hobbits so richly to life, Tolkien's epic about the Ring would have left our world enhanced by enchantment. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>J.R.R.Tolkien (1892-1973) was a distinguished academic, though he is best known for writing The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion and The Children of Hurin, plus other stories and essays.

Lavishly photographed with step-by-step instructions, this is an indispensable guide to gluten-free baking for everyone.</p><p>JEFFREY LARSEN is a cooking instructor, recipe developer, pastry chef, and food stylist specializing in allergen-free cooking and baking. He has worked on a number of cookbooks, cooking magazines, and advertising campaigns. His allergen-free journey started when he began developing recipes for his dairy- and gluten-intolerant mother twelve years ago. In helping his mother, Jeffrey gave himself a head start when he discovered that he is also gluten-intolerant.Introduction<br><br>MY PHILOSOPHY OF ALLERGEN-FREE BAKING<br><br>When I first began my journey of becoming a gluten-free baker, I had already been a baker, experienced in experimenting with gluten flours for many years. I had assimilated the visual cues of what wheat flour looked like as dough and what wheat-based batters looked and felt like. What was most striking when I turned to gluten-free baking was how different the process was and how different the doughs and batters sometimes looked. I struggled with this for a long time. I discovered that I couldn&#x2019;t rely on the instincts that I had internalized over my years of cooking and baking with wheat flour.<br><br>Thinking outside the box brought me to a place of success in my gluten-free baking. Sometimes it was a matter of blending techniques and sometimes it was a matter of finding new ways of handling the dough or batter. For instance, I borrowed an ageold technique for building structure in a cake and brought it to my cookie baking&#x2014; creaming the butter and sugar together and adding the eggs one at a time.<br><br>The other striking thing was how wildly the end results varied. I was an experienced baker and yet I was having so many failures. In instances like this, it is easy to give up and stop baking. The ingredients are expensive, and your time is valuable. It is no fun having to throw a baked good out or, worse, having to suffer through eating a subpar sweet because you don&#x2019;t want to waste anything.<br><br>Somewhere along the line, I got frustrated enough to start weighing my ingredients and tracking my experience. It was about this time that I was working as a recipe tester for a gluten-free baking book, and all of the measurements were in cups. I discovered that the only good way to track my results was to weigh all the flours. I was working long-distance with the author, and I wanted her to be able to see exactly what I was doing. She began to weigh the flours as well, and eventually we found a more precise way of handling the testing process. The recipes began to work for both of us.<br><br>The other thing that is worth noting here is that the weights in this book are based on the way I was trained to weigh flours: using a spoon, lightly add the flour to the measuring cup, then level off the cup with a straight edge. For every flour in this book, I weighed each flour seven times, totaled the cumulative weight, and divided by seven to get an average. Once I created this standard, I stuck to it through all of my recipe development and testing. I also expected my testers to use the weights that I came up with. This is why my weights will not match the standardized weights that you see on the internet or anywhere else. If you are not going to use the weights in this book, I would suggest that you measure as I do&#x2014;by measuring the flour lightly (not in packed cups). All of those standardized weights on the internet are based on how someone weighs flour, and we all do it very differently.<br><br>Weighing ingredients is a time-honored tradition with all professional bakers, and it is standard in countries that use the metric system. Throughout most of the world, nobody would bake without weighing the ingredients. I started writing all of my recipes only by weighing the ingredients. I developed the recipes in this book with my mother, working long-distance between Montana and San Francisco. I wanted my mother to have the same results that I was having, so I bought her a scale and taught her how to use it. She soon started to love this way of baking: measuring all of the dry ingredients into one bowl. We both agreed it was so much easier and more precise than using cup measures.<br><br>My key to successful gluten-free baking is this: buy a scale and weigh your ingredients. I have included the customary units of measure, but I would strongly urge you to weigh the dry ingredients if you want the best results and consistency. Gluten-free baking requires multiple flours, so the chance for error goes up incrementally with each consecutive dry ingredient. Take a look at the tutorial on the opposite page for how to use a scale properly for baking. After getting comfortable with it, you may never go back to the American way of measuring. All of your flours can be weighed in the same bowl simply by hitting the tare button between each flour. Tare weight is the true weight of the ingredients minus the weight of the bowl. You should always place your mixing bowl on the scale first and hit the tare button.<br><br>You might wonder why I adhere to customary units of measure when it comes to the smaller amounts: teaspoons and tablespoons. My belief is that most of the inexpensive kitchen scales on the market are not very accurate at measuring weights under 10 grams. More expensive, top-of-the-line scales are great at weighing small quantities, but not everyone needs or wants an expensive scale (see pages 30 and 265 for some recommendations). But remember: the smaller measurements need care as well. The best way to measure a teaspoon or tablespoon is to overfill the measurement, then level it off with an offset spatula, the back of a butter knife, or some other straightedge. Careful measuring is key to making these recipes work.<br><br>A note on mix-ins: Although I strongly urge you to weigh the ingredients for a recipe, I don&#x2019;t provide weights for mix-ins like chocolate, nuts, seeds, and other additions. These types of ingredients affect the recipe&#x2019;s integrity less than flour does, so it&#x2019;s okay if your mix-ins are not weighed to precise measurements. Use your regular dry measuring cup and fill it level with the sides.</p><h2>A Guide to Writing Sociology Papers</h2><p>Using actual student papers annotated with author comments,<em> Guide to Writing Sociology Papers</em> teaches you how to think sociologically as you begin to write through real-life examples of good writing and how writing can be improved.</p><p></p><h2>Abnormal Child and Adolescent Psychology with DSM-V Updates (8th Edition)</h2><p><i> </i><p><i>Abnormal Child and Adolescent Psychology with DSM-5 Updates</i>, 8/e presents students with a comprehensive, research-based introduction to understanding child and adolescent psychopathology.

Winston Smith knows this, because his work at the Ministry of Truth involves the constant "correction" of such records. "'Who controls the past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.'"</p><p> In a grim city and a terrifying country, where Big Brother is always Watching You and the Thought Police can practically read your mind, Winston is a man in grave danger for the simple reason that his memory still functions. He knows the Party's official image of the world is a fluid fiction. He knows the Party controls the people by feeding them lies and narrowing their imaginations through a process of bewilderment and brutalization that alienates each individual from his fellows and deprives him of every liberating human pursuit from reasoned inquiry to sexual passion. Drawn into a forbidden love affair, Winston finds the courage to join a secret revolutionary organization called The Brotherhood, dedicated to the destruction of the Party.

Taigen has long been active in social justice programs, including Peace and Environmental Activism.When Loori, now abbot of Zen Mountain Monastery, began his Buddhist practice, he couldn't find much written on the subject of zazen (sitting meditation). This anthology's 22 selections seek to fill that perceived void. Eight ancient voices such as the Fourth Ancestor of Chinese Zen Great Master Dayi (A.D. 580-651) and Eihei Dogen (A.D. 1200-1253), the most important Japanese Zen master, are translated by accomplished scholars such as Thomas Cleary. Beyond a half dozen supporting texts in the glossary, the other selections are by contemporary authors such as Shunryu Suzuki (Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind). Taken together, the writing spans 1,500 years, all pointing to the practice of "just sitting," whereby no object (breath, candle, mandala, mantra, etc.) is used as a meditation focus. Differing from the other type of zazen wherein koans are studied, shikantaza-just sitting-is less pointed in its intent and methods. There are specific instructions here for location, posture and mental state, which will be helpful for beginners.

Paradoxically, Chinese teachers receive far less education than U.S. teachers--11 to 12 years of schooling versus 16 to 18 years of schooling.<br> <br>Studies of U.S. teacher knowledge often document insufficient subject matter knowledge in mathematics. But, they give few examples of the knowledge teachers need to support teaching, particularly the kind of teaching demanded by recent reforms in mathematics education.<br>This book describes the nature and development of the "profound understanding of fundamental mathematics" that elementary teachers need to become accomplished mathematics teachers, and suggests why such teaching knowledge is much more common in China than the United States, despite the fact that Chinese teachers have less formal education than their U.S. counterparts.<br>The studies described in this book suggest that Chinese teachers begin their teaching careers with a better understanding of elementary mathematics than that of most U.S. elementary teachers. Their understanding of the mathematics they teach and--equally important--of the ways that elementary mathematics can be presented to students, continues to grow throughout their professional lives.<br>Teaching conditions in the United States, unlike those in China, militate against the development of elementary teachers' mathematical knowledge and its organization for teaching. The concluding chapter of the book suggests changes in teacher preparation, teacher support, and mathematics education research that might allow teachers in the United States to attain profound understanding of fundamental mathematics.<br></p><p><p>Liping Ma earned a Ph.D. from Stanford University, following a masters degree in education from East China Normal University.

In captivity, octopuses have been known to identify individual human keepers, raid neighboring tanks for food, turn off lightbulbs by spouting jets of water, plug drains, and make daring escapes. How is it that a creature with such gifts evolved through an evolutionary lineage so radically distant from our own? What does it mean that evolution built minds not once but at least twice? The octopus is the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien. What can we learn from the encounter? </p><p>In <i>Other Minds</i>, Peter Godfrey-Smith, a distinguished philosopher of science and a skilled scuba diver, tells a bold new story of how subjective experience crept into being&#x2015;how nature became aware of itself. As Godfrey-Smith stresses, it is a story that largely occurs in the ocean, where animals first appeared. Tracking the mind&#x2019;s fitful development, Godfrey-Smith shows how unruly clumps of seaborne cells began living together and became capable of sensing, acting, and signaling. As these primitive organisms became more entangled with others, they grew more complicated. The first nervous systems evolved, probably in ancient relatives of jellyfish; later on, the cephalopods, which began as inconspicuous mollusks, abandoned their shells and rose above the ocean floor, searching for prey and acquiring the greater intelligence needed to do so. Taking an independent route, mammals and birds later began their own evolutionary journeys. </p><p>But what kind of intelligence do cephalopods possess? Drawing on the latest scientific research and his own scuba-diving adventures, Godfrey-Smith probes the many mysteries that surround the lineage. How did the octopus, a solitary creature with little social life, become so smart? What is it like to have eight tentacles that are so packed with neurons that they virtually &#x201c;think for themselves&#x201d;? What happens when some octopuses abandon their hermit-like ways and congregate, as they do in a unique location off the coast of Australia?</p><p>By tracing the question of inner life back to its roots and comparing human beings with our most remarkable animal relatives, Godfrey-Smith casts crucial new light on the octopus mind&#x2015;and on our own.</p></p><p><b>Peter Godfrey-Smith</b> is a distinguished professor of philosophy at the Graduate Center, City University of New York, and a professor of the history and philosophy of science at the University of Sydney.

Science had made the idea of a Creator irrelevant - or so Strobel thought.</p><p>But today science points in a different direction. A diverse and impressive body of research has increasingly supported the conclusion that the universe was intelligently designed. At the same time, Darwinism has faltered in the face of concrete facts and hard reason. Has science discovered God? At the very least, it's giving faith an immense boost, as new findings emerge about the incredible complexity of our universe.</p><p>Join Strobel as he reexamines the theories that once led him away from God. Through his compelling and highly readable account, you&#x2019;ll encounter the mind-stretching discoveries from cosmology, cellular biology, DNA research, astronomy, physics, and human consciousness that present astonishing evidence in&nbsp;<em>The Case for a Creator</em>.</p><p>Also available: <em>The Case for a Creator </em>small group video study and study guide, Spanish edition, kids' edition, student edition, and more.</p></p><p>Are Christianity and science incompatible? If there is a God, is he only an impersonal starter force? An introductory high school biology class first propelled Lee Strobel toward a life of atheism. God and science, he reasoned, were mutually exclusive. When the former legal editor of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> converted to Christianity, he decided to investigate the science he had once accepted as truth. Did science point toward or away from God? As Strobel interviews a variety of scientists on everything from debunking evolutionary icons to the implications of the Big Bang to the existence of the human soul, he builds his case: scientific evidence points toward Intelligent Design. <p> Although the discussion often veers into the academic, Strobel works hard to make it accessible to those without scientific training. Throughout the book, he salts interview transcript information with interesting personal stories of his own spiritual and scientific quest for knowledge, as well as sometimes over-detailed descriptions of the actual interviews (right down to the type of beverages consumed). Each chapter contains suggestions for further reading on particular issues of science and faith. </p><p> Strobel concludes that, when correctly interpreted, science and biblical teaching support each other. He quotes physicist Paul Davies, "...science offers a surer path to God than religion." Open-minded readers will find that this book, and its questions for reflection and group study, invites conversation and investigation.--<i>Cindy Crosby</i></p>In The Case for a Creator&#x2014;Student Edition, bestselling author and former atheist Lee Strobel and popular writer Jane Vogel take younger readers on a remarkable investigation into the origin of the universe, interviewing many of the world&#x2019;s most renown scientists and following the evidence wherever it leads. <p>Their findings&#x2014;presented in the third blockbuster "Case" book student edition&#x2014;offer the most compelling scientific proof ever for intelligent design.

Capturing its brilliantly compact poetry and finely wrought, purposeful prose, Alter renews the Old Testament as a source of literary power and spiritual inspiration. From the family frictions of Genesis and King David&#x2019;s flawed humanity to the serene wisdom of Psalms and Job&#x2019;s incendiary questioning of God&#x2019;s ways, these magnificent works of world literature resonate with a startling immediacy. Featuring Alter&#x2019;s generous commentary, which quietly alerts readers to the literary and historical dimensions of the text, this is the definitive edition of the Hebrew Bible. 3 maps</p><p>Robert Alter&#39;s translation of the Hebrew Bible, the magnificent capstone to a lifetime of distinguished scholarly work, has won the PEN Center Literary Award for Translation. His immense achievements in scholarship ranging from the eighteenth-century European novel to contemporary Hebrew and American literature earned Alter the Robert Kirsch Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Los Angeles Times. A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, Alter is the Class of 1937 Professor of Hebrew and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Berkeley.&#x201c;[Alter&#x2019;s] achievement is monumental, marked by literary grace and intelligent commentary.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[A] truly magnificent translation...beautifully produced.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Eric Ormsby, <em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[Alter&#x2019;s] accomplishment...is almost absurdly impressive.

Alter will have to settle for one of the God-fearing Hebraic terms of praise that stipple his text: &#x2018;righteous&#x2019; or &#x2018;strong&#x2019; or, simply, &#x2018;wise.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Adam Gopnik, <em>New Yorker</em></strong></p><h2>Passalong Plants</h2><p>Passalongs are plants that have survived in gardens for decades by being handed from one person to another. These botanical heirlooms, such as flowering almond, blackberry lily, and night-blooming cereus, usually can't be found in neighborhood garden centers; about the only way to obtain a passalong plant is to beg a cutting from the fortunate gardener who has one. <br>In this lively and sometimes irreverent book (don't miss the chapter on yard art), Steve Bender and Felder Rushing describe 117 such plants, giving particulars on hardiness, size, uses in the garden, and horticultural requirements. They present this information in the informal, chatty, and sometimes humorous manner that your next-door neighbor might use when giving you a cutting of her treasured Confederate rose. And, of course, because they are discussing passalong plants, they note the best method of sharing each plant with other gardeners. <br>Because you might not spy a banana shrub or sweet pea in your neighborhood, the authors list mail-order sources for the heirloom plants described. They also give tips on how to organize your own plant swap. Although the authors live in and write about the South, many of the plants they discuss will grow elsewhere. from the book Amid the clamor of press releases touting the newest, improved versions of this bulb or that perennial, what keeps people interested in old-fashioned plants? Nostalgia, for one thing. It's hard not to feel a special fondness for that Confederate rose, night-blooming cereus, or alstroemeria lovingly tended by your grandmother when you were a child. Such heirloom plants evoke memories of your first garden, of relatives and neighbors that have since passed on, of prized bushes you accidentally annihilated with your bicycle. Recall the time you first received a particular plant, and you'll recall the person who gave it to you.<br><br></p><p>"The perfect marriage of two noble traditions: southern storytelling and a gardener's love for sharing plants."-- <i>American Horticulturist</i> <br>Steve Bender is a senior writer for <i>Southern Living</i> and a contributor to several books on southern gardening.

This newly edited Norton Critical Edition includes an introduction that explains the history of the <em>Autobiography</em> within the larger history of the life-writing genre as well as within the history of celebrity. The text is accompanied by new and expanded explanatory annotations and by a map, an illustration, and six facsimiles.<br><br> &#x201c;Contexts&#x201d; presents a broader view of Franklin&#x2019;s life with a journal entry from a 1726 voyage, correspondence, a <em>Poor Richard</em> piece on ambition and fame, Franklin&#x2019;s views on self-improvement, and his last will (and codicil).<br><br> &#x201c;Criticism&#x201d; draws on a wealth of material that reflects both the wide range of Franklin&#x2019;s achievements and the global impact of his life and memoirs. New international voices in &#x201c;Contemporary Opinions&#x201d; include Immanuel Kant, Honor� Gabriel Riqueti, Comte de Mirabeau, Jos� Antonio de Alzate y Ram�rez, and Jos� Francisco Correia da Serra. &#x201c;Nineteenth-Century Opinions&#x201d; includes Humphry Davy on Franklin&#x2019;s discovery of electricity as well as Empress Shoken of Japan&#x2019;s Franklin-inspired poem.

Cohen on Franklin and the <em>Autobiography</em>'s importance to science; Michael Warner&#x2019;s theoretical interpretation of the practices of writing and printing and what they tell us about Franklin; and Peter Stallybrass&#x2019;s insightful and engaging history-of-the-book perspective on Franklin&#x2019;s writing generally and the <em>Autobiography</em> specifically.<br><br> A Chronology of Franklin&#x2019;s life, a Selected Bibliography, and an Index are also included.<br></p><p>Also available by Edmund S. Morgan: Benjamin FranklinBlessed with enormous talents and the energy and ambition to go with them, Franklin was a statesman, author, inventor, printer, and scientist. He helped draft the Declaration of Independence and later was involved in negotiating the peace treaty with Britain that ended the Revolutionary War. He also invented bifocals, a stove that is still manufactured, a water-harmonica, and the lightning rod.<br>Franklin's extraordinary range of interests and accomplishments are brilliantly recorded in his <i>Autobiography, </i> considered one of the classics of the genre. Covering his life up to his prewar stay in London as representative of the Pennsylvania Assembly, this charming self-portrait recalls Franklin's boyhood, his determination to achieve high moral standards, his work as a printer, experiments with electricity, political career, experiences during the French and Indian War, and more. Related in an honest, open, unaffected style, this highly readable account offers a wonderfully intimate glimpse of the Founding Father sometimes called "the wisest American."</p><h2>Twelve Theories of Human Nature</h2><p>Over five previous editions, <em>Ten Theories of Human Nature</em> has been a remarkably popular introduction to some of the most influential developments in Western and Eastern thought. Now titled <em>Twelve Theories of Human Nature,</em> the sixth edition adds chapters on Islam (by Peter Wright) and Freud to those on Confucianism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Plato, Aristotle, the Bible, Kant, Marx, Sartre, and Darwinism. The authors juxtapose the ideas of these and other thinkers and traditions in a way that helps students understand how humanity has struggled to comprehend its nature.<br> <br> To encourage students to think critically for themselves and to underscore the similarities and differences between the many theories, the book examines each one on four points--the nature of the universe, the nature of humanity, the diagnosis of the ills of humanity, and the proposed cure for these problems.<br> <br> Ideal for introductory courses in human nature, philosophy, religious studies, and intellectual history, this unique volume will engage and motivate students and other readers to consider how we can understand and improve both ourselves and human society.</p><p><br><strong>Leslie Stevenson</strong> is Honorary Reader in Philosophy, University of St. Andrews, Scotland.<br><br><strong>David L.

Impressionable, innocent, enthusiastic, eager to learn, and all different. In fact, if you believe that all children are identical&#x2015;with the same interests, abilities, and size&#x2015;then <i>Children Moving</i> is not the book for you. The authors of <i>Children Moving</i>, however, recognize that each child is unique. One size does not fit all! Thus, <i>Children Moving</i> guides you in the process of learning to teach a curriculum that is differentiated for a range of skill abilities and fitness levels. If all children were the same, we would be able to package a curriculum with the same games and the same gymnastic stunts and dances you would do with all of the children as if they were identical. <i>Children Moving</i>, on the other hand, introduces you to the reflective approach&#x2015;a process of teaching that provides the background for you to adapt, adjust, and modify lessons so they are interesting and worthwhile for all of the children you teach&#x2015;from the lowest to the highest skill and fitness levels. The ultimate goal, of course, is to guide youngsters in the process of becoming physically active for a lifetime. The lesson plans to accompany <i>Children Moving</i>, <i>On the Move: Lesson Plans for Children Moving</i>, are now available on the CREATE platform.

Acclaimed authors Tom L. Beauchamp and James F. Childress thoroughly develop and advocate for four principles that lie at the core of moral reasoning in health care: <strong>respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice.</strong> Drawing from contemporary research--and integrating <strong>detailed case studies</strong> and <strong>vivid real-life examples and scenarios</strong>--they demonstrate how these prima facie principles can be expanded to apply to various conflicts and dilemmas, from how to deliver bad news to whether or not to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatments.<br> Illuminating both theory and method throughout, <em>Principles of Biomedical Ethics,</em> Sixth Edition, considers what constitutes moral character and addresses the problem of moral status: what rights are due to people and animals, and when. It also examines the professional-patient relationship, surveys major philosophical theories--including utilitarianism, Kantianism, rights theory, and Communitarianism--and describes methods of moral justification in bioethics. Ideal for courses in biomedical ethics, bioethics, and health care ethics, the text is enhanced by hundreds of annotated citations and a substantial introduction that clarifies key terms and concepts.<br><br><strong>Features of the Sixth Edition:</strong> <br>* Integrates case studies throughout the text, rather than presenting them in an appendix as in previous editions<br>* A new chapter on moral status (Chapter 3)<br>* Extensively revised and expanded material on the theory of the common morality (Chapters 1 and 10)<br>* A reworked discussion of the ethics of care as a form of virtue ethics (Chapter 2)<br>* Revised and updated treatments of nonmaleficence and beneficence, which take into account recent legal and philosophical literature and discussions (Chapters 5 and 6)<br>* A new section on vulnerability and exploitation as it applies to justice (Chapter 7)<br>* A more concise treatment of the principles of biomedical ethics throughout the text, featuring developed, refined, and modified perspectives</p><p>Tom L. Beauchap is a Professor of Philosophy at Georgetown University. James F. Childress is Hollingsworth Professor of Ethics and Professor of Medical Education at the University of Virginia."Principles of Biomedical Ethics is, and continues to be, a tremendous contribution to the bioethics literature. Whether one agrees or disagrees with [the authors'] approach, it is unquestionable that theirs is the predominant means of addressing ethical dilemmas in healthcare in the United<br>States today."--Deborah Barnbaum, Kent State University<br><br>"Principles of Biomedical Ethics has the deserved status of a classic in its field. The authors are excellent role models of ethical reasoning for students to emulate."--Craig Duncan, Ithaca College<br><br>"The overall quality of Principles of Biomedical Ethics is outstanding. From it, a careful and interested reader can come away with a thorough, in-depth, and consistent understanding of bioethics. The major strength of the book is its firm grounding in theory. In this respect, it stands head<br>and shoulders above any of its competitors."--Robert Rothman, Rochester Institute of Technology<br><br>"The new sixth edition of Principles of Biomedical Ethics is a welcome event. There is nothing else like it in the field of bioethics. It has easily become over the years the most used, most praised, and most distinguished book in the field. Each edition moves beyond the previous ones in<br>important and nuanced ways. Beauchamp and Childress keep up with the ever-changing terrain of bioethics, and work hard to refine their own arguments. It gets better and better. One can hardly ask for more."--Daniel Callahan, Director, International Program, The Hastings Center<br><br>"What is by far the best general book on bioethics has gotten even better. The new material on international justice and virtue ethics is especially valuable. Such a combination of accessibility and rigor is rarely attained."--Allen Buchanan, James B. Duke Professor of Philosophy and James B.<br>Duke Professor of Public Policy Studies, Duke University<br><br>"This sixth edition of Principles of Biomedical Ethics reaffirms its undisputed stature as a canonical text for the world's bioethicists. It maintains a standard of scholarship and clarity appealing to neophytes and seasoned scholars, to adherents and critics of its principled approach. It<br>culls the new and the old with precision and adds a new chapter on moral status. Anyone hoping to stay current with the continuing evolution of bioethics must read this update."--Edmund D. Pellegrino, Chairman, President's Council on Bioethics<br><br>"The contemporary field of bioethics is unimaginable, absent this text. Principles of Biomedical Ethics provided a paradigmatic approach that shaped the early character of bioethics. It continues to be a source of serious debate regarding the nature of morality and the significance of<br>bioethics. No one can understand the field of bioethics apart from this volume."--H. Tristram Engelhardt, Jr., M.D., Professor, Rice University and Baylor College of Medicine<br><br>"Principles of Biomedical Ethics has, over six successive editions, clarified and expanded the concepts, definitions, and arguments that make bioethics a discipline instead of random shards of opinion, sometimes astute, sometimes silly, that pass in the media for ethical commentary on medicine<br>and science. This book is the thesaurus of bioethical discourse."--Albert R. Jonsen, Professor Emeritus, Department of Medical History and Ethics, University of Washington<br><br>"The sixth edition of Principles of Biomedical Ethics, which more than any other book has helped to shape the field of biomedical ethics, is even better than the previous five editions. Beauchamp and Childress continue to listen to their critics, of whom I am one, and to change their book<br>accordingly. Although I still have some problems with the theory of principlism, I have nothing but admiration for their comprehensive and detailed discussion of the moral problems that arise in the field of medicine. I plan to use this edition, as I have used previous editions, as one of the<br>primary texts in my course in Philosophy of Medicine."--Bernard Gert, Stone Professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy, Dartmouth College<br><br>"Every new edition of this classic gets better and better. This is essential reading for all students and scholars of bioethics."--Bernard Lo, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Director, Program in Medical Ethics, University of California, San Francisco</p><h2>The Abandonment Recovery Workbook: Guidance through the Five Stages of Healing from Abandonment, Heartbreak, and Loss</h2><p><b>A powerful workshop-in-a-book for healing from loss</b><br><br>One day everything is fine.

When he is not writing, he operates his photography company, Treehouse Photography, with his talented partner, Sarah Linden.&#x201c;A collection of poems that evoke consistent inspiration and lasting resonance.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Literary Inklings</b><br><br>&#x201c;Your heart will be stoked.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Christina Perri, singer/songwriter</b><br><br>"Gregson is clearly a romantic...

Maybe it&#x2019;s the allure of his Typewriter Series (awesome poems and quotes typed on vintage-looking parchment paper) or the fact that he posts just about every day so people always have something to see, but in the end I think it&#x2019;s his raw talent for striking the chords of emotion within us that keep us coming back&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;The Blonde Vegan</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;His Haikus inspire in their simplicity because it has become rare to find beauty in the mundane.

Then, there are writers and poets who are so on point, you have no choice but to feel like maybe they've been reading your diary. If you're an avid Tumblr user, or just a fan of knowing you're not alone, you might be familiar with the work of Tyler Knott Gregson. Not only is Gregson a well-versed poet (pun intended) but he's also an incredible artist, photographer and has a big heart for charity.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Buzznet</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;With over 30,000 Facebook fans and more than 100,000 Tumblr followers, Gregson has definitely hit a nerve with his short-yet-poignant pieces. In an age of goofy Vine videos, memes and Instagram dinner-plate photos, poetry seems an unlikely addition to the community of web shares and posts. Gregson&#x2019;s poetry, though, isn&#x2019;t about flashy design or snappy humor. To read the comments on his blog and Facebook pages, it&#x2019;s plain to see that his words genuinely resonate with his fans.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Elsewhere NYC</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I LOVE THIS! &nbsp;I follow Tyler Knott Gregson on Twitter and Tumblr.

With swashbuckling irreverence and devilish wit, Peter Leeson uncovers the hidden economics behind pirates' notorious, entertaining, and sometimes downright shocking behavior. Why did pirates fly flags of Skull &amp; Bones? Why did they create a "pirate code"? Were pirates really ferocious madmen? And what made them so successful? <i>The Invisible Hook</i> uses economics to examine these and other infamous aspects of piracy. Leeson argues that the pirate customs we know and love resulted from pirates responding rationally to prevailing economic conditions in the pursuit of profits.</p><p> <i>The Invisible Hook</i> looks at legendary pirate captains like Blackbeard, Black Bart Roberts, and Calico Jack Rackam, and shows how pirates' search for plunder led them to pioneer remarkable and forward-thinking practices. Pirates understood the advantages of constitutional democracy--a model they adopted more than fifty years before the United States did so. Pirates also initiated an early system of workers' compensation, regulated drinking and smoking, and in some cases practiced racial tolerance and equality. Leeson contends that pirates exemplified the virtues of vice--their self-seeking interests generated socially desirable effects and their greedy criminality secured social order. Pirates proved that anarchy could be organized.</p><p> Revealing the democratic and economic forces propelling history's most colorful criminals, <i>The Invisible Hook</i> establishes pirates' trailblazing relevance to the contemporary world.</p></p><p><p>"A fresh and provocative take on the Golden Age pirates. Leeson writes with clarity and the depth of his research is impressive."<b>--Colin Woodard, author of <i>The Republic of Pirates</i></b></p><p>"Peter Leeson has brought the economists' toolkit to the Spanish Main. Piracy is not just a great topic for Walt Disney movies, but also an important economic phenomenon. Leeson's excellent book helps us to understand who pirates were, and why they chose their infamous occupation. He uses economics to make sense of walking-the-plank and the Jolly Roger. This is a fun book, but also a volume rich with insights and analysis."<b>--Edward Glaeser, Harvard University</b></p><p>"Light of touch and truly eloquent, <i>The Invisible Hook</i> is a terrific read on a fascinating topic. This is a beautifully written book."<b>--Geoffrey Brennan, Duke University and University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill</b></p><b>Peter T.

Marieb</b>, taking the student&#x2019;s perspective into account has always been an integral part of her teaching style. Dr. Marieb began her teaching career at Springfield College, where she taught anatomy and physiology to physical education majors. She then joined the faculty of the Biological Science Division of Holyoke Community College in 1969 after receiving her Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. While teaching at Holyoke Community College, where many of her students were pursuing nursing degrees, she developed a desire to better understand the relationship between the scientific study of the human body and the clinical aspects of the nursing practice. To that end, while continuing to teach full time, Dr. Marieb pursued her nursing education, which culminated in a Master of Science degree with a clinical specialization in gerontology from the University of Massachusetts. It is this experience that has informed the development of the unique perspective and accessibility for which her publications are known.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dr. Marieb has partnered with Benjamin Cummings for over 30 years. Her first work was Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology Laboratory Manual (Cat Version), which came out in 1981. In the years since, several other lab manual versions and study guides, as well as the softcover Essentials of Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology textbook, have hit the campus bookstores. This textbook, now in its Ninth edition, made its appearance in 1989 and is the latest expression of her commitment to the needs of students studying human anatomy and physiology.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dr. Marieb has given generously to provide opportunities for students to further their education. She contributes to the New Directions, New Careers Program at Holyoke Community College by funding a staffed drop-in center and by providing several full-tuition scholarships each year for women who are returning to college after a hiatus or attending college for the first time and who would be unable to continue their studies without financial support. She funds the E. N. Marieb Science Research Awards at Mount Holyoke College, which promotes research by undergraduate science majors, and has underwritten renovation and updating of one of the biology labs in Clapp Laboratory at that college. Dr. Marieb also contributes to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst where she generously provided funding for reconstruction and instrumentation of a cutting-edge cytology research laboratory. Recognizing the severe national shortage of nursing faculty, she underwrites the Nursing Scholars of the Future Grant Program at the university.<br>&nbsp;<br>In 1994, Dr. Marieb received the Benefactor Award from the National Council for Resource Development, American Association of Community Colleges, which recognizes her ongoing sponsorship of student scholarships, faculty teaching awards, and other academic contributions to Holyoke Community College. In May 2000, the science building at Holyoke Community College was named in her honor.<br>&nbsp;<br>In January 2012, Florida Gulf Coast University named a new health professions facility &#x201c;Dr. Elaine Nicpon Marieb Hall.&#x201d; With the help of Dr. Marieb&#x2019;s generous donation, this facility contains laboratories in the School of Nursing that simulate an operating room, intensive-care unit, a labor and delivery room, and general medical surgical suites. She has also established a scholarship endowment for non-traditional students in the health professions, and an endowment to enhance the activities of faculty, students, and staff within health professions to support education, research, and community outreach.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dr. Marieb is an active member of the Human Anatomy and Physiology Society (HAPS) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Additionally, while actively engaged as an author, Dr. Marieb serves as a consultant for the Benjamin Cummings Interactive Physiology� CD-ROM series.<br>&nbsp;<br>When not involved in academic pursuits, Dr. Marieb is a world traveler and has vowed to visit every country on this planet. Shorter term, she serves on the scholarship committee of the Women&#x2019;s Resources Center and on the board of directors of several charitable institutions in Sarasota County. She is an enthusiastic supporter of the local arts and enjoys a competitive match of doubles tennis.<br>&nbsp;<br> <b>Lori A.

Hubert Dreyfus's commentary opens the way for a new appreciation of this difficult philosopher, revealing a rigorous and illuminating vocabulary that is indispensable for talking about the phenomenon of world.</p><p>The publication of <i>Being and Time</i> in 1927 turned the academic world on its head. Since then it has become a touchstone for philosophers as diverse as Marcuse, Sartre, Foucault, and Derrida who seek an alternative to the rationalist Cartesian tradition of western philosophy. But Heidegger's text is notoriously dense, and his language seems to consist of unnecessarily barbaric neologisms; to the neophyte and even to those schooled in Heidegger thought, the result is often incomprehensible.</p><p>Dreyfus's approach to this daunting book is straightforward and pragmatic. He explains the text by frequent examples drawn from everyday life, and he skillfully relates Heidegger's ideas to the questions about being and mind that have preoccupied a generation of cognitive scientists and philosophers of mind.</p></p><p>Begin-in-the-world is a guide to one of the most influential philosophical work of the century: Division I. of part one of Begin and Time, where Martin Heidegger works out an original and powerful account of begin-in-the-World which he then uses to ground and profound critique of traditional ontology and epistemology.Hubert L.

While the style of the time was soft-focus, impressionistic photographs, Blossfeldt's purpose governed his photographic method and resulting magnificent prints: direct lighting to define form, sharp focus to expose detail and texture, enlarging up to 27 times actual size to reveal structure that previously was invisible or overlooked by the naked eye. <br>His subject matter &#x2015; the leaves, buds, stems, seed pods, tendrils, and twigs of plant life &#x2015; sparkles with an honest simplicity and clarity that discloses not only the wonder and science of nature, but also the distinct similarities between the form developed by nature and that produced by man. In the infinite variety of form in the plant world, Blossfeldt found many examples of shape and structure that, when photographed his way, resemble the forms of man's artistic (particularly architectural) styles &#x2015; from Gothic through Art Nouveau. His images imply that man's art mirrors nature and suggest that nature, in its continuous reproduction and adaptation, also creates its own art. <br>Blossfeldt's exquisite and historically important photographs continue to be prominently exhibited and acclaimed throughout the world. Painstakingly reproduced for this edition, his 120 unretouched plates will delight artists and illustrators, naturalists and philosophers, photographers, and anyone who is intrigued by the beauty, form, and design of nature.</p><p></p><h2>The Man Without Qualities, Vol. 2: Into the Millennium</h2><p>&#34;Musil belongs in the company of Joyce, Proust, Kafka, and Svevo. . . .

It is written and designed to help readers build an informed foundation for individual understanding and enjoyment of art. By introducing art theory, practice, and history in a single volume, this book aims to draw students into a new or expanded awareness of the visual arts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Beyond fostering appreciation of major works of art, this book&#x2019;s primary concern is to open students&#x2019; eyes and minds to the richness of the visual arts as unique forms of human communication and to convey the idea that the arts enrich life best when we experience, understand, and enjoy them as integral parts of the process of living.</p></p><p><p> </p> <p>Patrick Frank has taught in many higher education environments, from rural community colleges to private research universities.

His portrait of a golden-tongued evangelist who rises to power within his church&#x2014;a saver of souls who lives a life of duplicity, sensuality, and ruthless self-indulgence&#x2014;is also the record of a period, a reign of grotesque vulgarity, which but for Lewis would have left no trace of itself. <i>Elmer Gantry </i>has been called the greatest, most vital, and most penetrating study of hypocrisy that has been written since the works of Voltaire.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>With an introduction by Jason Stevens</b></p><p><b>Sinclair Lewis </b>was born in 1885 in Sauk Centre, Minnesota, and graduated from Yale University in 1908. His college career was interrupted by various part-time occupations, including a period working at the Helicon Home Colony, Upton Sinclair&#x2019;s socialist experiment in New Jersey. He worked for some years as a free lance editor and journalist, during which time he published several minor novels. But with the publication of <b>Main Street </b>(1920), which sold half a million copies, he achieved wide recognition. This was followed by the two novels considered by many to be his finest, <b>Babbitt </b>(1922) and <b>Arrowsmith </b>(1925), which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1926, but declined by Lewis. In 1930, following <b>Elmer Gantry </b>(1927) and <b>Dodsworth </b>(1929), Sinclair Lewis became the first American author to be awarded the Nobel Prize for distinction in world literature. This was the apogee of his literary career, and in the period from <b>Ann Vickers </b>(1933) to the posthumously published <b>World So Wide </b>(1951) Lewis wrote ten novels that reveal the progressive decline of his creative powers. <b>From Main Street to Stockholm</b>, a collection of his letters, was published in 1952, and <b>The Man from Main Street</b>, a collection of essays, in 1953. During his last years Sinclair Lewis wandered extensively in Europe, and after his death in Rome in 1951 his ashes were returned to his birthplace.Lewis&#39;s classic story of a corrupt and cynical evangelical preacher would seem torn from the pages of current newspapers if the dialogue weren&#39;t surprisingly dated. Elmer Gantry is charismatic without being likable, which makes voicing him a tricky business for Anthony Heald. His Elmer is an ambitious, self-righteous sociopath, whose timbre betrays no trace of conscience, self-doubt, regret, or sympathy for others, even at the beginning of his career. Heald&#39;s pacing, his accents, his narrative drive are all excellent, although his women tend to sound the same, mostly breathy, credulous ninnies. It may be that that&#39;s all there was on the page, but with no character growth in sight, the dispiriting effect is of one jarring note overwhelming the music from beginning to end.

The <i>Atlas of Great Lakes Indian History</i>, in a sequence of thirty-three newly researched maps printed in as many as five colors, graphically displays the movement of Indian communities from 1640 to about 1871, when treaty making between Indian tribes and the United States government came to an end.</p> <p> History was shaped in this part of North America by intertribal warfare, refugee movements, epidemics of European-introduced diseases, French and English wars and trade rivalry, white population advances, Indian resistance, Indian treaties deeding land to state and national governments, and imperfect arrangements for reservations, removal, and allotment of land. The changing pattern of Indian village locations as a result of all these factors is shown on the maps. Each map is highlighted by accompanying text, written as if the author were pointing out specific places on the map.

The bulk of the material in this slipcased paperback, however (and bulk is used here in the most complimentary way possible), spans the past four centuries. The delights are abundant. A facsimile image of a 1777 version of <i>The New-England Primer</i>, America's original schoolbook, is reprinted in its entirety (sample vocabulary words: humiliation, mortification, purification). John Newbery, who "excelled at collecting materials that could be assembled cheaply and attractively to be marketed" (and for whom the Newbery Medal is named), is represented by an excerpt from his book on "Epistolary Writing." In addition to instructing children on how to correspond with church and government officials, he includes Anne Boleyn's last missive to Henry VIII as an example of an "important" letter. Zipes and his collaborators cull from fables, nursery rhymes, comics, poetry, plays, science fiction and fantasy, providing a lens through which the evolution of childhood itself can be viewed. The scope is expansive&#x2014;the fairy tales hail from Grimm and Perrault, but also from Francesca Lia Block and Julius Lester. Headnotes introduce authors and illustrators, often tracing the lineage between them: Lear's Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo as grandfather to Seuss's Sneetches, for instance. The volume contains dozens of complete works and hundreds of illustrations, including a 32-page color inset of seminal artwork from the likes of Greenaway, Brunhoff and Sendak. A mile wide and very deep, this is an invaluable resource for professionals, but fun for casual perusing, too.

Each chapter explores a topic in two to four pages, then poses questions accompanied by lucid explanations. This immediate opportunity to use the facts just presented, and the step-by-step process of explication, reinforce the text in a user-friendly fashion. Suggested activities include a stated purpose, materials needed, and clearly delineated procedures. The results are described, and a discussion of why things happened further amplifies the material. For example, two chapters on ocean pollution provide excellent information along with representative activities demonstrating run off and the effect of oil on bird feathers. The narrative is easy to read and understand. Informal and sometimes humorous line drawings appear throughout. Although similar in scope to Seymour Simon's How to Be an Ocean Scientist in Your Own Home (HarperCollins, 1988), the arrangement of text, questions, activities, and explanations in Oceans for Every Kid is clearer and more inclusive.

Although these are parts of what they are about, the essays by Owen Flanagan, Bryan Van Norden, and Robin R. Wang show that this conception is overly simplified, incomplete, and misleading. The risk of cherry-picking bits and pieces&#x2014;such as meditation or yoga&#x2014;without a fuller understanding of the underlying philosophy is that we end up with commercialized cults of the self, sacrificing credit cards and calories to the Yoga Fashion Gods Inc., which is a far cry from what the Buddha, Confucius, and Laozi teach. Buddhism, Confucianism, and Daoism are philosophies of life that present primarily practical guides for ethical behavior.<br><br>Buddhism is, by some estimates, currently the fourth largest &#x201c;religion&#x201d; in the world, after Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism, accounting for around 500 million people, or nearly 7 percent of the world&#x2019;s population.1 It is hard to say how many people follow Confucianism and Daoism, because when polls are done in Korea and China, for example, only a small percentage say they officially belong to the &#x201c;religion&#x201d; of Confucianism, but most conform to and enact a Confucian way of life. Confucianism is more a cultural and philosophical affiliation than a religious one, and the ideas and texts of Confucians continue to exert deep cultural influences on billions of people.<br><br>The popular practices of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Daoism could have been included as religions in Group III, but we think they merit their own section, not only because they originated in Asia, but also because they do not worship deities in the same ways as more orthodox religious traditions (such as Hinduism). They often do make reference to deities or spiritual entities, and there are religious rites and temples associated with them, but intellectuals in each tradition typically regard them as &#x201c;skillful means,&#x201d; that is, expedients for justifying or explaining the philosophical teachings to people. Moreover, their focus is on the individual, or the individual within society, rather than a god, and, as Flanagan argues, Buddhism in particular lends itself well to secularization for those looking for a spiritual and ethical, but not necessarily religious, philosophy.<br><br>Siddhartha Gautama, more commonly known as &#x201c;the Buddha,&#x201d; was an Indian prince who lived around 500&#x2013;400 BCE. At the age of twenty-nine, he traveled away from his palace to meet his subjects and was shocked by the sickness and suffering he witnessed. He became an ascetic and at thirty-five meditated under a bodhi tree for forty-nine days and, according to the legend, became enlightened. He set about spreading his wisdom on how to achieve enlightenment. Like Daoism and Stoicism (which we will come to soon), Buddhism aims to relieve pain and suffering. Key sources of our existential pain are emotions such as anger, resentment, and blame, which inflict suffering on ourselves as well as others. Buddhists check, or as Flanagan puts it, &#x201c;deflate&#x201d; their ego by exercising virtues including compassion, loving-kindness, sympathetic joy, and equanimity. &#x201c;The ethical imperative,&#x201d; Flanagan says, &#x201c;is always to love, to substitute compassion and love whenever and wherever there is suffering, violence, cruelty, and hate.&#x201d; This is part of the path to releasing ourselves from our attachments and freeing ourselves from the endless cycle of rebirth, so that we may find a state of serenity and, ultimately, nirvana. It is not always as simple as it sounds, though&#x2014;and Flanagan talks us through the problem of whether a Buddhist would kill Hitler, a thought experiment that might for some end in a brain cramp.<br><br>About the same time that Buddhism was flourishing in India, China was having its own golden age of philosophy. Between 770 and 221 BCE there was intense interstate warfare in China, but also vibrant intellectual debate, as thinkers argued over the solutions to China&#x2019;s problems. This spurred a widespread enthusiasm for education and learning, leading to what was called the period of the &#x201c;Hundred Schools of Thought,&#x201d; as new ideas flowed and flourished. This is when Confucianism and Daoism developed, along with Mohism (a form of impartial consequentialism); the School of Names (concerned with the philosophy of language and dialectics); Legalism (a philosophy of government based on clear laws that are strictly enforced); and the School of Yin-yang (which sought to understand and potentially control the course of history through the use of concepts such as yin, yang, and the Five Phases).<br><br>Kongzi, more commonly known in the West as Confucius, advocated compassion for others and personal integrity. Kongzi claimed that we have special obligations to those tied to us by personal relations such as kinship. This emphasis on filial piety is one of the best-known aspects of Confucianism. However, Confucians stress that we should have compassion not only for those close to us, but for &#x201c;all under Heaven,&#x201d; since we are all interdependent. The Confucian way is to treat everyone as if they were our own siblings, parents, or children, because we exist within relationships, and good relationships make for a good life.<br><br>Compassion for others is a manifestation of benevolence, one of the four Confucian cardinal virtues, along with righteousness (integrity in the face of temptations), wisdom, and propriety (skillfulness in following social conventions such as etiquette and ritual). Confucianism is similar to Buddhism in advocating compassion. However, Buddhism sees attachments as the source of suffering, while Confucianism argues that a good life is one rich in healthy attachments, to family, friends, and humans in general. Confucians and Buddhists also disagree on the nature of the self. For the Buddhist, we are impermanent and without a fixed essence. A Confucian says that to deny the fact of individual existence, &#x201c;is like closing one&#x2019;s eyes so that one does not see one&#x2019;s nose&#x2014;but the nose is still there where it belongs,&#x201d; as Bryan Van Norden notes.<br><br>Another influential philosophy to emerge from the Hundred Schools of Thought was Daoism&#x2014;sometimes spelled Taoism in English, but the Chinese characters are the same&#x2014;or the &#x201c;School of the Way,&#x201d; founded by the sages Laozi and Zhuangzi.2 Whereas Confucianism is concerned with social harmony, Daoism is interested in the individual living in harmony with nature and the natural flow of the universe. As Robin Wang explains, we align ourselves with the Dao (the way) by putting our mind on a diet. We dig out the tangled weeds of anxiety and worry that clog up our mind, and clearing them out leaves some empty space for illumination and acuity. We prepare for and accept uncertainty, and go with the flow of the world, but focus on taking control of our body and nurturing it, like a garden. Happiness comes not from nirvana or relationships necessarily, but rather from trusting and following the flow and, as Mama Wang tells her daughters, when we &#x201c;eat well, exercise daily, get plenty of sleep, and do well in school.&#x201d; Daoism&#x2019;s ultimate vision, however, is a spiritual transformation that brings the finite human life into an infinite cosmos.<br><br>Notes<br><br>1Pew-Templeton Global Religious Futures, &#x201c;The Future of World Religions: Population Growth Projections, 2010&#x2013;2050,&#x201d; Pew Research Center (April 2, 2015): 102, https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/NAzdCZ6WyZF6XmrXfzi-Kq?domain=assets.pewresearch.org.<br><br>2Laozi is also sometimes known as Lao-Tzu, Lao-Tze, or Li Er and means &#x201c;Old Master.&#x201d; Zhuangzi, meaning &#x201c;Master Zhuang,&#x201d; is also sometimes known as Chuang-Tzu or Zhuang Zhou.<br><br>Chapter One<br><br>Buddhism<br><br>Owen Flanagan<br><br>Let me tell you about the occasion on which I first vividly experienced Buddhism as both an utterly alien and extremely attractive form of life, simultaneously unimaginable given that I was already well socialized in another way of world-making, and yet worth emulating if I could change myself completely, becoming a different kind of person with an entirely different economy of heart and mind. Since then I have been trying to become more like that person, to absorb some Buddhist wisdom and Buddhist habits of the heart. I am still very much a hybrid being.<br><br>It was March 2000, and I was in Dharamsala, India, a hill station in the Himalayan foothills, for four days of meetings with the fourteenth Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso; some of his fellow Buddhists; and a group of Western scientists, mostly psychologists and neuroscientists, to discuss the topic of destructive emotions and how to overcome them (see Goleman 2003 for a report on these meetings).<br><br>It became clear after a day or so of talks that Tibetan Buddhists believe that anger, resentment, and their suite of emotions are categorically bad, always unwarranted, wrong, and &#x201c;unwholesome,&#x201d; as they are inclined to say. That was surprising by itself. We, denizens of the North Atlantic, don&#x2019;t categorically dismiss anger as inappropriate, but we do draw limits around its expression or magnitude, such as &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get too angry&#x201d; or &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get so angry.&#x201d; Wrath, after all, is considered by Christians to be a deadly sin. Most of us do not think that we should never get angry (even if we could show such self-restraint) or that anger is always wrong. For us, justifiable anger demonstrates that one sees and cares about something genuinely valuable. Everyday anger and annoyance only show that one is human. Minimally, we expect and tolerate a certain amount of these emotions. Then there is the fact that most people I know were raised to think it okay, permissible, possibly sometimes required, to feel and express outrage. Righteous anger is something we ought sometimes to experience and express, something that certain people or states of affairs deserve.<br><br>I know that there are coping mechanisms and rules of decorum&#x2014;&#x201c;counting to ten,&#x201d; sublimation, or &#x201c;tamping it down&#x201d;&#x2014;norms that keep us from expressing anger or that work to contain it, but not experiencing anger at all seems to me unnatural, weird, not human. Again, self-work to keep from getting pissy over small frustrations makes good sense and is certainly possible. But except for the rare bird of saintly even temperament, never experiencing anger&#x2014;at the cosmos or the gods or especially evil people for their awfulness&#x2014;seems close to a psychological impossibility. But then there was this kicker, even more mind-boggling: these Buddhists also believed that anger could be eliminated in mortals, that there are practices that actually work so that it is possible not to experience anger, practices that can extirpate anger, cleanse the soul of tendencies to anger.<br><br>I found myself posing this thought experiment to the Dalai Lama. Imagine that one were to find oneself in a public space&#x2014;a park, a movie theater&#x2014;where one realizes that one is seated next to Hitler&#x2014;or Stalin or Pol Pot or Mao&#x2014;early in the execution of the genocides they actually perpetrated. We, my people, think it would be appropriate first to feel moral anger, possibly outrage at Hitler et al., and second, that it would be okay, possibly required, to kill them, supposing one had the means. What about you Tibetan Buddhists?<br><br>The Dalai Lama turned to consult the high lamas who were seated behind him, as usual, like a lion&#x2019;s pride. After a few minutes of whispered conversation in Tibetan with his team, the Dalai Lama turned back to our group and explained that one should kill Hitler (actually with some martial fanfare, in the way&#x2014;to mix cultural practices&#x2014;a samurai warrior might). It is stopping a bad, a very bad, karmic causal chain. So, &#x201c;Yes, kill him. But don&#x2019;t be angry.&#x201d;<br><br>What could this mean? How did it make sense to think of one human being killing another, being motivated to kill another human being, without feeling, without activating the suite of reactive attitudes such as anger, resentment, blame?<br><br>The thought is that Hitler is an unfortunate node in the way the world is unfolding. He did not choose to be the evil person he is. He deserves compassion, not anger. And he must die for reasons of compassion: compassion for him and all those who might suffer his awfulness.<br><br>Stoics, excellent warriors, thought something similar, that when effective action is required against an enemy, including his elimination, emotions like fear and anger get in the way, immobilize, cause one to under- or overreach, and undermine skillfully achieving one&#x2019;s aims. In De Ira, and in a direct challenge to Aristotle, Seneca writes: &#x201c;It is easier to banish dangerous emotions than to rule them.&#x201d; The mature person is disciplined and thoughtful, whereas the angry person is undisciplined and sloppy; &#x201c;anger is excited by empty matters hovering on the outskirts of the case.&#x201d;<br><br>Seneca, like other Stoics, thought that we confuse the occasional necessity of severe punishment and war with the necessity of anger. Aristotle, he says, claims that anger is useful for the soldier, although not for the general. But good soldiers, good Stoic warriors are never angry; otherwise they make a mess of what sometimes sadly needs to be done. Seneca&#x2019;s recommendation for anger: &#x201c;Extirpate root and branch. . . . What can moderation have to do with an evil habit?&#x201d;<br><br>I came to understand later that the requirement to extirpate anger in the Buddhist and Stoic cases has to do with the primacy of ethics in both philosophies. The aim of ethics is to do good, to reduce pain and suffering (dukkha), and, if possible, to bring happiness in its stead. Anger, at least in one standard mode, aims to hurt, to do harm, to inflict suffering. And one should never aim to do that. Anger is the handmaiden of the rapacious ego that demands satisfaction, and the grasping, rapacious ego that seeks to destroy what lies in its way is the problem, the main cause of suffering, not the solution.<br><br>In the Buddhist case, there is an additional reason to oppose anger that has to do with a uniquely Buddhist metaphysics of human agency. Hitler and his ilk are bad nodes in the way the universe is unfolding. He must be stopped. That is a practical imperative. But we who are positioned to stop him, and duty-bound to do so, must do so with love and compassion. Hitler, after all, could have been one&#x2019;s own self, one&#x2019;s child, or one&#x2019;s parent. The ethical imperative is always to love, to substitute compassion and love whenever and wherever there is suffering, violence, cruelty, and hate. This impulse to live compassionately, to try to relieve the suffering of all sentient beings is the key Buddhist idea. It is put forward as the only sensible response to the universal predicament of suffering. Where there is suffering, try to relieve it, and to bring happiness instead.<br><br>In the fertile spiritual ecology of northern India in the fifth century BCE, there was a plethora of spiritual practices promoting solutions to the problem of samsara, the cycle of birth and death. In the first instance, samsara refers to the simple fact that whatever arises or is born eventually dies, decays, and disperses. Each and every thing&#x2014;plant, animal, and person&#x2014;is born and dies. Each one of us will lose others whom we love and be lost to people who love us. Knowing even at the moment of birth that the precious and innocent child will suffer the slings and arrows of fortune, and will eventually grow old and die, shadows the happiness of welcoming a newborn into the world.</p><h2>All&#39;s Well That Ends Well (Folger Shakespeare Library)</h2><p><b><i>All's Well That Ends Well</i>&nbsp;from the Folger Shakespeare Library</b><br>Shakespeare's&nbsp;<i>All's Well That Ends Well</i>&nbsp;is the story of its heroine, Helen, more so than the story of Bertram, for whose love she yearns.

When he was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway. The couple had three children--an older daughter Susanna and twins, Judith and Hamnet. Hamnet, Shakespeare's only son, died in childhood. The bulk of Shakespeare's working life was spent in the theater world of London, where he established himself professionally by the early 1590s. He enjoyed success not only as a playwright and poet, but also as an actor and shareholder in an acting company. Although some think that sometime between 1610 and 1613 Shakespeare retired from the theater and returned home to Stratford, where he died in 1616, others believe that he may have continued to work in London until close to his death.<br>Barbara A.

Something in our nature points beyond itself; something in us searches for and desires personal connection with God. Although communicating with our Creator through prayer is innate, the effective practice of it often feels just beyond our reach. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unique book guides you to pray in deeper and more authentic ways. The short prayers and thought-provoking imagery, interspersed with contemplative reflections and suggested practices, will stir, inform, and encourage you. The simplicity of the prayers and the aesthetic appeal of the images will inspire people in every facet of life, including those with no real religious background at all.</p><p><b>Justin McRoberts</b>&nbsp;is an author, musician, and retreat leader. He lives in the Oakland/San Francisco Bay Area with his wife and two children.<br><br><b>Scott Erickson</b>&nbsp;is a touring painter, performance artist, and creative storyteller who mixes autobiography, biblical narrative, and aesthetics to create art that speaks to our deepest experiences. Scott lives in Portland, Oregon, with his wife and three children.<p><b>Before You Begin</b><br><br>Creators of all kinds (particularly authors) tend to refer to our work as &#x201c;content,&#x201d; that is, something contained. I&#x2019;ve come to think that&#x2019;s a bit of a misnomer. I&#x2019;d like to suggest that Scott and I make resources and tools that stir, inform, and inspire human lives but that it is what is happening in those human lives that is most rightly understood as content. In that spirit, this book is rooted in the content of two human lives (Scott&#x2019;s and mine) but should not be, as an artifact, most accurately considered content.</p><p>This book is a piece of art.</p><p>This book is an act of love.</p><p>This book is a redemptive tool.</p><p>This book is a resource.</p><p>This book is designed to stir, inform, and inspire you.</p><p>This book is not &#x201c;content.&#x201d;</p><p>The ongoing conversation between you and God is content.</p><p>***</p><p>I remember kneeling next to my mother&#x2019;s bed, trying to balance a small porcelain statue of Jesus on the lumpy bedspread. When I thought I had set it firmly upright, I folded my hands and closed my eyes to pray, only to be interrupted by the light thump of Jesus toppling over again. I don&#x2019;t know how many times I repeated the process, but as best as I remember, I never got around to the actual business of praying because I couldn&#x2019;t set up correctly.</p><p>As I have with so much else in my process of faith, I had allowed mechanics to trump essence. I thought I needed all the right elements properly executed in order to pray. Instead of seeing those elements as helpful (which they most certainly can be), I treated them as essential (which they most certainly are not). I was like a man who had seen water delivered only in clear glasses and would not, regardless of how deep his thirst, drink from another container. I think you will agree that the method of delivery, be it glass or plastic or the cupped shape of a human hand, can be very helpful and might even be beautiful, but it is the act of drinking that matters first.</p><p>I have come to believe that allowing the mechanics of prayer to trump essence presents a grave danger. Having grown distracted or disillusioned by mechanics, I might too easily abandon something I essentially need. You see, I believe I pray because I am human rather than because I am religious. An essential aspect of my nature points me beyond my nature and, I further believe, beyond what I know of nature altogether. Some primal thing urges me to search for and connect with the Divine. Tradition can and does provide language, shape, and space for that primal urge to pray, but the instinct to connect with God does not emanate from that tradition. Having allowed the mechanics of tradition to take a back seat to the essential nature of prayer, I can more readily receive the language and imagery of tradition as a great gift.</p><p>Our desire in this book is to extend a gift to you from our own practices and traditions by providing language and imagery you may find helpful for your practice of prayer. Herein, you will find us doing that in four ways:</p><p>~&nbsp; Guided prayers</p><p>~&nbsp; Contemplative imagery</p><p>~&nbsp; Meditations</p><p>~&nbsp; Suggested practices</p><p><br><b>Guided Prayers </b></p><p>Since 1998, as a writer of both prose and song, I have worked to provide language for the process of faith and life. In a sense, I am offering back a gift given to me. I have often needed the words of others to help me see what was in my soul when my own language failed me.</p><p>From Thomas Merton to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. or from my neighbor to immediate family, the gift of others&#x2019; words has been like borrowing a cup from someone else so that I could pour my life into it...or pour it out.</p><p>May the language herein be that same kind of gift to you. Consider focusing on one guided prayer (and its corresponding image) each day and see what you find in you.<br><br></p><p><b>Contemplative Imagery </b></p><p>Scott and I wanted to create something that invites you to do far more than simply read what is written and agree or disagree. The design of this book is an invitation to stop, listen, hear, see, recognize, and contemplate your life, the lives of those you love, and the presence of God in, through, and around all of it. That kind of contemplation takes what Scott likes to call an &#x201c;excavation of the soul&#x201d;&#x2014;the kind of digging good art invites us to do.<br><br></p><p><i>In Scott&#x2019;s words: </i></p><p>We&#x2019;ve all read a book that has pictures in it. Most likely the illustrations creatively visualized the words being communicated in the story. If it was a children&#x2019;s book, the images did all the heavy lifting in keeping your attention. That&#x2019;s how most of us experience imagery.</p><p>But I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s what these images are for. I think imagery is another language entirely. Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Newberg agrees, writing in his book <i>How God Changes Your Brain</i>, &#x201c;Drawing is a form of communication that is neurologically distinct from writing and speech.... In essence, words and pictures are two integrated elements of language, and most words...have an &#x2018;image&#x2019; quality associated with them. If the right hemisphere is injured, words and pictures lose their meaning.&#x201d; He continues, &#x201c;Words are not enough to describe a spiritual experience.&#x201d;[1]</p><p>Prayer is a conversation about everything. Words and images are vital tools that can help us grow in this endless and ongoing conversation, but we must understand that the words and images we use are not the content itself. They are excavation tools that help dig toward and into the real content: the ongoing, ever-present conversation between us and the Divine.</p><p>Scott has often been asked what his paintings mean. And while questions of intrinsic meaning can lead to interesting conversations, perhaps a better question about visual art is, <i>What does the piece draw out of you?</i> Henri Nouwen&#x2019;s remarkable book <i>The Return of the Prodigal Son</i> is a retelling of his interactions with Rembrandt&#x2019;s iconic work by that same name. Rather than centering the book on what can be found in the painting, Nouwen shares the ways Rembrandt&#x2019;s work dug into and unearthed pieces of his soul, helping him see things in himself in need of repair, as well as things healed and in the process of restoration.</p><p>May the imagery herein be that same kind of gift to you. <br><br></p><p><b>Meditations </b></p><p>The transitions between the book&#x2019;s sections are highlighted by meditations on the essence or nature of prayer. By calling them meditations instead of essays or even reflections, we are inviting you to engage with them a touch differently. Rather than asking yourself, <i>What do I think about this?</i> or&nbsp;<i>Is this correct?</i>, pay attention to your responses, emotions, and thoughts. What is happening in you as you read through the meditations? In other words, we&#x2019;re not asking you to come to a conclusion or make a judgment about the content or to agree with the philosophical or theological angle taken. These meditations, much like the brief prayers and images, are intended to stir what is in you rather than to get information into you.<br><br></p><p><b>Suggested Practices</b></p><p>Each of the six meditations is paired with a way to practice the discipline of prayer. Our desire is to be a help to you in your long-term process rather than to provide a singular moment of inspiration. Including these suggested practices is a way for us to offer something you can return to and use on the road ahead&#x2014;the kind of book you keep with you in your bag or on your nightstand.</p><p>We suggest allowing yourself some time to practice unfamiliar types of prayer. Not everything works for everyone, but we&#x2019;ve found that it can take a fair bit of work and honest trial to truly discover what works for you. For both Scott and me, engaging the almost endless variety of methods and shapes of prayer has been a freeing and soul-shaping gift. May the practices suggested herein (journaling, exercise, fasting, meditation, lament, and intercession) be that same kind of gift to you. <br><br></p><p><b>May I...Make an Assumption? </b></p><p>In putting this book together, Scott and I assume the loving and redemptive activity of the Divine in, around, and through your life. In that light, framing our prayers with &#x201c;May I...&#x201d; is a way to enter into the extant movement of God rather than feel we are responsible for chasing God down somewhere we aren&#x2019;t yet living.</p><p>The &#x201c;May I...&#x201d; language of these prayers borrows from the jussive mood in the Genesis creation account, wherein God speaks all things into being by saying &#x201c;Let there be....&#x201d; The jussive mood suggests that Reality should be the way God desires it, not simply because God says so, but because being shaped and ordered according to the Divine Will is the fullest expression of Reality. Praying &#x201c;May I...&#x201d; is a way to enter into the work God is already doing in, around, and through us, according to God&#x2019;s Will and design.</p><p>We join Mary, the mother of Jesus, who prayed, &#x201c;May Your word be fulfilled in me,&#x201d; or &#x201c;May it be with me as You say,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Let it be with me according to Your word,&#x201d; or &#x201c;May everything You have said about me come true.&#x201d; Praying &#x201c;May I...&#x201d; means leaning into what God is doing and how the Divine Will has set things in and around us in motion.<br><br></p><p><b>Teach Me to Number My Days </b></p><p>While there is a great deal of value in prayer guides offering a more structured and chronologically ordered approach to the practice, we&#x2019;re offering something rather different here. Consider the layout and format of this book an invitation to let your soul, rather than a page number or calendar day, tell you where to stay or move and when. Certainly, you are welcome to start with prayer 1 and work straight through to prayer 40 in linear fashion (the book&#x2019;s layout allows for that as well). But should you find yourself resonating with a particular prayer, stay there. And if you land on a prayer that just doesn&#x2019;t connect with or stir anything in you, feel free to move on.</p><p>Because it isn&#x2019;t the format of this book that matters most.</p><p>Nor is it the words in this book.</p><p>Nor its imagery.</p><p>What&#x2019;s happening in you is what matters.</p><p>What&#x2019;s happening in you is real content.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<br><br></p><br><p>[1] Andrew Newberg and Mark Robert Waldman, <i>How God Changes Your Brain: Breakthrough Findings from a Leading Neuroscientist&nbsp;</i>(New York: Ballantine, 2009), 99&#x2013;100.</p></p><h2>Peter Zumthor: Buildings and Projects, 1985-2013 [5 Volume Set]</h2><p>Unquestionably one of the most influential and revered contemporary architects, Peter Zumthor has approached his work with a singular clarity of vision and a strong sense of his own philosophy, both of which have earned him the admiration of his peers and the world at large. Choosing to only take on a few projects at a time and keep his studio small, Zumthor has produced a comparatively few number of realized buildings, but they rank among the world&#x2019;s most stunning: St. Benedict&#x2019;s Chapel in Sumvitg, Switzerland; Therme Vals in Vals, Switzerland; Kunsthaus Bregenz in Bregenz, Austria; and the Kolumba Art Museum in Cologne, Germany number among his most famous buildings. This collection, however, explores his entire body of award-winning work from 1986 to 2012 in five volumes, including his lesser-known but nonetheless critically acclaimed works such as the Field Chapel for Brother Klaus near Mechernich, Germany, and the <i>Steilneset. Memorial for the Victims of the Witch Trials in Vard</i><i>�</i><i>,</i> Norway.<i>Peter Zumthor </i>presents around forty of his projects, both realized and unrealized, through Zumthor&#x2019;s own writing, and with photographs, sketches, drawings, and plans. A complete catalog of his works starting in 1979 rounds out the book. Richly illustrated and beautifully designed, this book serves as both an introduction to Zumthor&#x2019;s work and philosophy for the layperson and a required addition to any architect&#x2019;s library. <br><br>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Thomas Durisch </b>is an architect who worked at Peter Zumthor&#x2019;s studio from 1990&#x2013;94, and has owned his own firm in Z�rich since 1995.

Rather than simply juxtaposing sketches, maps, and design plans with photographs of realized buildings, as is often the case with the architecture coffee-table book, these visual materials are deployed in a manner that reveals the working of the architect&#x2019;s imagination. . . . Each section is accompanied by well-written, translucent, somewhat rhapsodic reflections by Zumthor.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2016-05-04)</p><h2>The RSC Shakespeare: The Complete Works</h2><p><p>Developed in partnership with The Royal Shakespeare Company, this edition of the Complete Works of William Shakespeare combines exemplary textual scholarship with elegant writing and design.

It&#39;s the essential reference book for anyone who&#39;s ever been in love, felt jealousy, fear, hatred, or desire. All human life is here - and every home should have one.&#39; - Dame Judi Dench &#39;The paper quality and page design are excellent, and the illustrations in the introductory materials are lavish and well reproduced ...a virtual comet-tail of supplementary materials are to be found at www.rscshakespeare.co.uk - the RSC is certainly the first edition of Shakespeare to provide a link to it&#39;s editor&#39;s blog... Bate&#39;s general introduction to Shakespeare&#39;s life, stage and reputation is superb, and the short introductions to individual works, in particular, are among the best of their kind available...they manage to speak about what really matters about the plays to readers who wish, whether they are already familiar with them or not, to come to them freshly.&#39; - Michael Dobson, writing in The London Review of Books &#39;Timely, original, and beautifully conceived, the RSC edition makes Shakespeare&#39;s extraordinary accomplishment more vivid than ever.&#39; - James Shapiro, Professor, Columbia University and prize-winning author of 1599: A Year in the Life of Shakespeare &#39;Everything about this edition is outstanding. To begin with, it&#39;s an attractively produced volume of the plays based on the 1623 First Folio, the landmark Shakespeare edition. Second, it&#39;s the work of two fine scholars who have harvested the labours of many experts to produce an edition that contains the fruit of the best contemporary research. Third, this exemplary text has greatly benefited from the active involvement of the RSC, a company whose recent work has exhibited an almost obsessional devotion to the meaning of Shakespeare&#39;s words in performance.&#39; - Robert McCrum writing in The Observer &#39;A handsome volume...printed on fine paper and elegantly designed... This is a beautiful book that will be a pleasure to own.&#39; - Good Book Guide &#39;Professor Jonathan Bate has written thought provoking essays for each play, discussing the source material and its influence on the play as well as pointing out the familiarities...for...contemporary audiences... The glossary includes much that has been ignored in the past, enlightening the new student...as well as adding to the vocabulary of those who have been enjoying his plays all their lives... This volume is an invaluable resource to anyone interested in or simply in love with Shakespeare.&#39; - Speech and Drama &#39;... anyone who wants a good single volume edition of the plays... won&#39;t do better than this.&#39; - Tribune &#39;Bate provides excellent introductory essays to each play and his terrific introduction, simply and effectively summarising everything you need to know about Shakespeare, man and work, is alone worth buying the edition for.&#39; - The Daily Express &#39;Thanks to Bate and Rasmussen, we now have a rendering of the Complete Works that, in a rare publishing achievement, would also give complete satisfaction to the author himself.&#39; - Robert McCrum, The Observer &#39;A magnificent new volume.&#39; - A. N. Wilson, Daily Telegraph &#39;A triumphant addition to our times.&#39; - Fiona Shaw, The Times &#39;This outstanding new edition of Shakespeare&#39;s plays is the closest yet to the originals ... a new and thoroughly radical edition ... supervised by Jonathan Bate, an outstanding scholar (and author of the best existing biography of Shakespeare) who writes with as much elegance as insight about the making of theatre and the creation of the plays... an impeccably informative introduction gives a comprehensive theatrical, social, political and biographical context to the plays. There are pithy essays, also by Bate, to introduce each play as well as exemplary notes at the foot of each page which translate verbal and topical obscurities ... for actors and directors it will be incomparably useful, but for any curious reader of Shakespeare&#39;s plays it provides an invaluable guide to reading them not as novels or dramatic poems, but as they were intended to be read: blueprints for live performance.&#39; - Richard Eyre, The Sunday Telegraph &#39;Excellent, succinct notes and introductions to each play.&#39;- John Carey, The Sunday Times &#39;A splendid edition.

My very favorite book (and one that stands out in my mind--and with much affection--to this day) is Tunnel in the Sky. I really, really wanted to go off to explore new worlds with a covered wagon and horses, like the hero does at the very end of the book. But one of the nice things about Robert Heinlein is that he's got something for everyone. One of my best friends has a different favorite: Podkayne of Mars. Go figure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Shelly Shapiro, Executive Editor<b>Robert A. Heinlein</b> was the greatest science fiction writer who ever lived. His novels have been translated into every literate language on the globe&#x2014;over 25 million Heinlein books are in print in this country alone.&nbsp; For five decades, young readers of science fiction discovered Heinlein, then gone on to voraciously devour every Heinlein book they can get their hands on. His now-legendary <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i> was the first hardcover bestseller by a science fiction writer. From 1975 on, every new Heinlein novel made the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller list and shipped a million copies, including <i>The Number of the Beast</i>, <i>Friday</i>, <i>Job: A Comedy of Justice</i>, <i>The Cat Who Walks Through Walls</i>, and <i>To Sail Beyond the Sunset</i>. In a career spanning half a century, he wrote over forty books, and four of his novels won Hugo Awards, an unequalled record for almost four decades. For the last three generations of readers, Heinlein <i>is</i> science fiction. <p>&nbsp; </p><p></p></p><h2>Mounting Fears (Will Lee, No. 7)</h2><p>In the aftermath of the vice president&#39;s unexpected death, President Will Lee finds his efforts to select a replacement hampered by a contender&#39;s secret misdeeds, a rogue CIA agent&#39;s vengeful plot against the first lady, and a nuclear threat in Pakistan. 300,000 first printing.</p><p>Stuart Woods is the author of fifty novels, including the New York Timesbestselling Stone Barrington and Holly Barker series.

It had been the nuclear nightmare wherein some unidentified country had launched missiles on the United States and he had to decide at whom to strike back. It was not the first time.<br>Will wiped the sweat from his forehead with the sleeve of his nightshirt, then tried to get out of bed without waking his wife. He was halfway to the bathroom when he remembered that Kate, who for the past four years had been director of intelligence, head of the CIA, had left for work two hours before, after an urgent phone call in the early hours.<br>Will stared at himself in the bathroom mirror while he waited for the water in the sink to get hot for shaving. How was he different from four years before? Considerably grayer, but Kate thought that lent him gravitas. His face was relatively unlined, still, and he took some pride in the fact that his waist size had not changed, in spite of only sporadic efforts to exercise.<br>He ran hot water onto the shaving brush, lathered his face, and began shaving while reviewing the high points of the day to come. Most important was a nine a.m. with the vice president, George Kiel, and he thought he knew what the meeting would be about.<br>FORTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER, dressed in a standard chalk-striped suit and a red-and-blue-striped necktie, Will walked through the door of the White House family quarters to be greeted by the young naval officer who carried the &#x201c;football,&#x201d; the briefcase containing the codes for a nuclear launch, and two Secret Service agents, who escorted him down the hallway and into the elevator.<br>Will had become accustomed to never being alone outside the family quarters and, sometimes, the Oval Office; he also had become accustomed to traveling to the airport in a large new helicopter, and from there in an outrageously well-equipped Boeing 747 with a bedroom and shower and conference room and telephones and Internet hookups and everything else that the minds of electronics experts could conceive. It had been harder to become accustomed to constantly being the most looked-at person in any room, up to and including Madison Square Garden. He had learned never to scratch his nether regions, because the video would be on the Internet within seconds.<br>The elevator reached the lower floor, and then, instead of being walked to the Oval Office, Will was walked to the press room in the basement of the White House. No preparation had been necessary, because the press had not been invited. Instead, the auditorium was filled with White House staffers.<br>Will stepped to the lectern. &#x201c;My God,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;who&#x2019;s answering the phones?&#x201d;<br>Tim Coleman, his chief of staff, stood up in the front row. &#x201c;Nobody, Mr. President,&#x201d; he said, then sat down again. Everybody laughed.<br>&#x201c;Well, good morning to you all,&#x201d; Will said. &#x201c;As I expect you may have heard, I&#x2019;m headed for New York today to accept the nomination tonight, and I wanted to say just a few words to you before I go.&#x201d; He looked around at the happy faces. &#x201c;It may surprise some of you that I got the nomination.&#x201d; Everybody laughed again. &#x201c;But I guess being the incumbent helps. What was even more of a help was the successful nature of our first term, and I use the pronoun advisedly. The people in this room had as much, maybe more, to do with that success than anyone else, and I wanted to thank you, personally, for that help.<br>&#x201c;Now, assuming that I win a second term for us&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s only an assumption at this point&#x2014;I&#x2019;m going to be faced with being called a lame duck for the next four years. It&#x2019;s my fervent hope that you will all be here to face that with me, but I understand that practically all of you have served for the past four years at a considerable financial sacrifice and that the call of the private sector, as the Republicans like to call the defense contractors and the Washington lobbying firms, will be ringing in your ears.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my hope that you will all be here during the campaign, because somebody has to run the White House, and that you&#x2019;ll be here early in the next four years to help break in your replacements&#x2014;should you choose to leave. I know, of course, that the last year of the next administration the rats will all be swimming for shore, and I can&#x2019;t blame them. I just want you to know that every one of you here has proved your value to the White House and to your country, and I would be delighted if you all decided to stay on for another four years.<br>&#x201c;That said, be sure to tune in to the convention tonight to learn if any of your suggestions made it into the speech. Bye-bye for now.&#x201d;<br>Will walked off the platform and was followed by Tim Coleman and Kitty Conroy, his director of communications. These two had been his aides when he was in the Senate, and they were closer to him than anyone else on the staff.<br>Will walked through the reception room outside the Oval Office. His secretary, Cora Parker, spoke up. &#x201c;Mr. President, the director of Central Intelligence and the deputy director for operations of the CIA are waiting in the Oval Office.&#x201d;<br>This was a surprise. &#x201c;Please send the vice president in when he arrives,&#x201d; he said. Kate and her DDO, Lance Cabot, were waiting for him, and they both stood as he entered. Will waved them to their seats and hung his coat on a stand by the door.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&#x201c;Mr. President,&#x201d; Kate said&#x2014;she always addressed him formally in meetings with others&#x2014;&#x201c;we have a report that a Taliban group, possibly aided by Al Qaeda operatives, have captured a missile site in northwestern Pakistan, near the Afghanistan border.&#x201d;<br>Will stopped in his tracks. &#x201c;A nuclear missile site?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; Kate said.<br>&#x201c;Are the Taliban able to fire the missiles?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They also captured most of the technicians alive.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So it&#x2019;s possible they could fire at something?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Just possible,&#x201d; Kate said. &#x201c;Not likely, but possible.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Have they made any demands?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, but we&#x2019;re expecting that shortly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Has the story broken?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not yet. The Pakistani president has clamped a tight lid on it, but I don&#x2019;t think we can count on that for long. When the occupiers of the site start making demands, they&#x2019;re very likely to make a lot of noise about it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why are there no military people here?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re on the way, sir,&#x201d; Kate replied. &#x201c;Their departure from the Pentagon was delayed by what they hope is new information coming in.&#x201d;<br>Cora Parker &#x2019;s head appeared from behind a door. &#x201c;Mr. President, the vice president and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Army chief of staff are here with their aides.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Send them right in,&#x201d; Will said, then stood up to receive the group. There was not a happy face among them.<br>Cora came back in behind them. &#x201c;Mr. President, President Mohammed Khan of Pakistan is on the phone.&#x201d;<br>Will walked to his desk. &#x201c;Excuse me, gentlemen,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better take this. Maybe he&#x2019;ll have something new.&#x201d;</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>WILL PICKED UP THE TELEPHONE AND PRESSED THE FLASHING BUTTON. &#x201c;PRESIDENT Khan?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, Mr. President.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I understand that a nuclear missile site has been taken by the Taliban.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That is correct, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And that Al Qaeda may be involved?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We expect so.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How can we help?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I am meeting with my military staff in a moment, and I hope to have an answer to that question afterward.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I understand that most of the technical staff were captured at the site?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, that is true, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Have the occupiers made any demands?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, and they are not responding to our communications.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is there anything I can do for you at this moment?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not yet, sir, but I will be in touch. I just wanted to be sure that you had been made aware of the situation.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I have, and my military and intelligence staff have just arrived. I hope to speak to you again when your meeting is over. Good-bye.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good-bye.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That was Mohammed Khan,&#x201d; Will said to the others. &#x201c;He seems to know little right now, but he&#x2019;s about to meet with his military staff.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mr. President,&#x201d; General Boone, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said, &#x201c;I think it would be best if we moved this meeting to the Situation Room, since we have some electronic intelligence to display, and that room is best equipped for it.&#x201d;<br>TEN MINUTES LATER the group had settled in around the conference table in the Situation Room. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;d like to start?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&#x201c;I would,&#x201d; Kate said. &#x201c;We have some satellite photos to show you.&#x201d; She clicked a remote control, and an image of mountains appeared; with a laser pointer she indicated a narrow valley. &#x201c;This is the location of the installation,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;As you can see we have clear weather, so this is a very good photo.&#x201d; She clicked again and zoomed in until the missile site appeared clearly. &#x201c;This is the view from about two thousand feet. You can see the cluster of buildings and the array of silos.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No people?&#x201d; Will asked.<br>&#x201c;Everyone seems to be inside the buildings, but you can see dead bodies here, here and here, around the perimeter fence.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What missiles are present?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I can answer that,&#x201d; General Boone said. &#x201c;There are six silos, two of which contain nuclear-tipped missiles. The others are conventional high explosive.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do we know the tonnage?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We believe no more than ten kilotons each,&#x201d; the general said, &#x201c;perhaps less.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what, half the tonnage of the Hiroshima bomb?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What range?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We think no more than a thousand miles. They could reach all of northwestern India, including Delhi.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But not Israel.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, sir. But if they were able to move a missile to the southwestern corner of Afghanistan, they could just about do it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But they can&#x2019;t move them?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There are two mobile missile launchers inside one of the buildings, but it would be quite a job to load a missile onto one and truck it four or five hundred miles, then fire. We think that very unlikely, and if they tried it we could knock out the vehicle and the missile.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If they were to attempt such a thing, how long might it take them?&#x201d;<br>The general permitted himself a small shrug. &#x201c;A week, ten days, perhaps.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s keep that in mind during our planning.&#x201d;<br>The vice president, George Kiel, spoke up. &#x201c;How far to the nearest Pakistani military base?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thirty miles,&#x201d; the general replied.<br>&#x201c;And what forces are present there?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;An armored regiment.&#x201d;<br>Will spoke up. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how they could attack the missile site with that sort of force,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;without risking a launch. They could certainly hit any city in Pakistan.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Correct, Mr. President,&#x201d; the general said. &#x201c;The key would be speed, to get there before the invaders get a grip on how to fire a missile.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That could be a very short time.&#x201d; Lance Cabot, the CIA DDO, had spoken for the first time, and everyone turned and looked at him.<br>&#x201c;They would need time to persuade the staff to start firing missiles,&#x201d; the general said.<br>&#x201c;Not if they had one or more men on the inside,&#x201d; Cabot said, &#x201c;and we know there have been terrorist attempts to penetrate the Pakistani nuclear program.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s troubling,&#x201d; Will said.<br>&#x201c;If it&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; the general countered. &#x201c;Mr. Cabot, do you have any evidence of such a penetration or even an attempt?&#x201d;<br>Cabot opened a folder in front of him. &#x201c;Three weeks ago, we received a report from a source inside the Pakistani government that two technicians at this site had not returned from weekend leave on schedule. They still have not returned. Up to now, at least.&#x201d;<br>The room was silent for a long moment.<br>&#x201c;General Boone,&#x201d; Will said, &#x201c;have you had time to do any planning? And if so, do we have the relevant forces available?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mr. President, we have a detachment of Navy SEALs deployed in the mountains, less than a hundred miles from the missile site.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How many men?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thirty, plus support people.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thirty doesn&#x2019;t sound like many.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There may be no Taliban other than the invading party,&#x201d; Boone said.<br>&#x201c;But we have no intelligence on the size of that party?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Correct, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do we know which silos contain the nuclear warheads?&#x201d; Will asked.<br>&#x201c;No, sir, but the Pakistanis do. So that information should be available to us.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is it possible, if the SEALs could get into the compound, to destroy the missiles in their silos without setting off a nuclear blast?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Theoretically, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Certainly,&#x201d; Cabot said, interrupting. &#x201c;The warheads are wired not to explode in the silos; they are armed by radio after firing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know that for sure,&#x201d; the general said.<br>&#x201c;We know for sure,&#x201d; Cabot replied. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve known since before the missiles were deployed. I would have thought the Pentagon would know it, too.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If we sent a few cruise missiles in there with conventional warheads,&#x201d; Will asked, &#x201c;could we knock out the nukes before they could be fired?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In theory,&#x201d; Cabot said, looking at Boone. &#x201c;General?&#x201d;<br>Boone turned to the president. &#x201c;Sir, the site was chosen to make that difficult, with high mountains surrounding it. An air strike would be more vertical&#x2014;and more precise.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What defenses would the site have against an air attack?&#x201d; Will asked. &#x201c;I presume that the surrounding mountains would reduce the effectiveness of radar until the aircraft were right on top of them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s probable, sir,&#x201d; the general replied. &#x201c;There are ground-to-air defensive missiles on the site. We don&#x2019;t know how many.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>California Mathematics Grade 5 (Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving) (Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving) by Patricia Frey, Arthur C.

To the millions it has sustained, it has been a treasure more precious that gold. This book spans 1,000 years and four continents. From the Vikings to Clarence Birdseye, Mark Kurlansky introduces the explorers, merchants, writers, chefs and fisherman, whose lives have been interwoven with this prolific fish. He chronicles the cod wars of the 16th and 20th centuries. He blends in recipes and lore from the Middle Ages to the present. In a story that brings world history and human passions into captivating focus, he shows how the most profitable fish in history is today faced with extinction.</p><p>You probably enjoy eating codfish, but reading about them? Mark Kurlansky has written a fabulous book--well worth your time--about a fish that probably has mattered more in human history than any other. The cod helped inspire the discovery and exploration of North America. It had a profound impact upon the economic development of New England and eastern Canada from the earliest times. Today, however, overfishing is a constant threat. Kurlansky sprinkles his well-written and occasionally humorous history with interesting asides on the possible origin of the word codpiece and dozens of fish recipes. Sometimes a book on an offbeat or neglected subject really makes the grade. This is one of them.<p>"Books as beautifully written and elegantly illustrated as this are, unhappily, as rare as cod. Kurlansky's marvellous fish opus stands as a reminder of what good non-fiction used to be: eloquent, learned, and full of earthy narratives that delight and appall. This book yields a feast of common and uncommon truths about the greatest of all hunters, homo sapiens."-The Globe and Mail</p> <p>"[A] marvellously enlightening ... concise biography that does justice to the vibrant and tragic history of the cod." -St. John's Evening Telegram</p> <p>"Stephen King would be proud.

Every mile took me farther from Plain City, Ohio, where I&#x2019;d been a flyspeck on the wallpaper of small--town life. Each new state I passed throughloosened another rope around my heart, my legs, my arms, yet my whole body ached and I couldn&#x2019;t shake my vertigo. I lived on aspirin, crackers, and soda pop. I cried and cried and cried. On the eighth day, California. Many hours after crossing the boundary,I got off the bus and pulled my sweater a little more tightly around me. I expected sun and warmth, but on that October afternoon, fog hung over San Francisco, damp, and shockingly cold.<br>&nbsp;<br>Picking up my suitcase, I left the bus station and started to walk. The receptionists at the cheap hotels I visited told me they were full. &#x201c;Go to Chinatown,&#x201d; they suggested. &#x201c;You can get a room there.&#x201d; I had noidea where Chinatown was, so that didn&#x2019;t help me. And I&#x2019;ll say this about San Francisco: lots of hills, water on practically every side, and, it seemed to me, not a single street ran purely in any one direction. Finally, a man at a fleabag took my money&#x2014;-adollar a day, in advance&#x2014;-and gave me a key to a room.<br>&nbsp;<br>I washed my hair in the basin and put it up in pin curls, then leaned in to the mirror to examine what remained of my injuries. My forehead had healed completely, but the inside of my skull continued to swim frombeing banged against the kitchen floor. The skin over my ribs was mottled green, gray, and purple. My shoulder still felt swollen and stiff from being dislocated and then jammed back into place, but the cut on my lip had nearly disappeared. I turned away andsat on the edge of the bed, hungry but too frightened to go out, and listening to the sound of God knows what coming through the walls.<br>&nbsp;<br>I opened my purse and pulled out the magazine clipping Miss Miller, who&#x2019;d taught me dance from the age of four, had torn from a magazine and given to me a few months earlier. I smoothed the advertisement with mypalm so I could study the artist&#x2019;s sketch of the Golden Gate International Exposition. Even its location on Treasure Island seemed to beckon. &#x201c;See, Grace, they&#x2019;re looking for six thousand workers,&#x201d; Miss Miller had said. &#x201c;Dancers, singers, welders, carpenters.The whole works.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d sighed then. &#x201c;I wanted to go so many places when I was young, but it takes guts&#x2014;-and talent&#x2014;-to leave everything and everyone you know. You could do it, though.&#x201d; Her few words and that slip of paper had given me the courage to believeI actually could. After all, I&#x2019;d won first prize at the Plain City Fair for my tap dancing and singing when I was seven and had held the title ever since.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>You always planned to leave home,</i> I told myself. <i>Just because you had to escape sooner than expected doesn&#x2019;t mean you can&#x2019;t still fly to the stars.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>But my pep talk&#x2014;-in a scary hotel room, in a strange city, in the middle of the night&#x2014;-did little to ease my fears. Once in bed, I could practically see the walls closing in around me. To calm myself, I began aroutine I&#x2019;d invented as a small child, running my hands the length of my arms (a broken tibia when I was three; my mom told Doc Haverford I fell down the stairs), slipping along my sides (several broken and fractured ribs over the years), and then lifting eachleg and squeezing all the way to my feet (my legs had been a frequent target until I started dancing). The ritual both strengthened and soothed me. I was now alone in the world, with no home to return to and no one to rely on, but if I could survive my father&#x2019;sbeatings and the petty prejudices of my hometown, then I could triumph over whatever obstacles the future threw my way. Maybe. Hopefully.<br>&nbsp;<br>The next morning, I combed out my hair, sweeping up the sides and letting the curls billow below, the way Carole Lombard did in <i>My Man Godfrey.</i> I put on the dress my dad bought for me when he took us toCincinnati to buy supplies for the laundry. I&#x2019;d chosen a dusty--rose--colored cotton frock, with a geometric print composed of interlocking mustard--yellow and steel--gray squares. Mom said the pattern of the fabric and cut of the dress looked too mature forme&#x2014;-and maybe that was so&#x2014;-but now I considered myself lucky to be wearing something so sophisticated.<br>&nbsp;<br>Filled with a sense of determination, I went downstairs and onto the street. I asked directions on nearly every corner and managed to find my way to the Ferry Building, where I boarded the boat to Treasure Island,about halfway across the bay and just under the Bay Bridge. I imagined everyone onboard was seeking a job at the Golden Gate International Exposition. As excited as I was, the pulse of the ferry through the choppy water roused my vertigo and my hunger untilI felt, once again, dizzy and sick. Once we reached the dock, everyone walked fast, wanting to be first in line for interviews. Me too. I spotted my first palm trees, which was thrilling because they meant I surely was in California. I&#x2019;d never seen anythinglike the fair&#x2019;s entrance. Giant towers composed of stacked cubes crowned by stylized elephants bookended the gate. Beyond, I glimpsed spires still clothed in scaffolding. My ears pounded from the sounds of hammers, the buzz of electric saws, the rumble of tractors,bulldozers, and flatbed trucks, and the shouts of men calling out orders and cursing the way they do on construction sites.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Will they be done on time?&#x201d; a man&#x2019;s voice asked very close to my ear.<br>&nbsp;<br>I jumped, spiraling into the terror I experienced around my dad. I swung around to find a young Occidental man about six feet tall, with broad shoulders and sandy--colored hair. He put up his hands in surrender.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I scared you.&#x201d; His mouth spread into a contrite smile as I met his deep blue eyes. He looked older than I&#x2014;-maybe around twenty. He extended his hand. &#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Joe.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Grace.&#x201d; No last names. I liked that.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for a job as a rolling--chair boy.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t bother to explain what that was. &#x201c;But the real reason I&#x2019;m here is that I love planes, and I love to fly.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Up ahead, the others from the ferry disappeared through the gate.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I love planes so much that my parents told me if I got straight <i>A</i>s in high school they&#x2019;d let me take flying lessons,&#x201d; Joe continued, sure of my interest. &#x201c;I trained in a Piper Cub. I learned how to takeoff, land, what to do in a stall, and how to pull out of a spin. Now I have my pilot&#x2019;s license.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>This told me, among other things, that his family had to be pretty well--off.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What does that have to do with rolling chairs?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He laughed and ran a hand through his hair. &#x201c;Pan Am&#x2019;s Clipper ships are going to be taking off and landing right here at Treasure Island!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I nodded, pretending interest when I didn&#x2019;t know what in the heck he was talking about.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been chewing your ear off,&#x201d; Joe acknowledged. &#x201c;Sorry about that. What are you doing here?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a dancer.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Neat.&#x201d; He pointed his chin toward the gate. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d better catch up.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>When I stumbled a bit in my low--slung heels, he grabbed my arm to steady me, and I instinctively pulled away. His eyes went banjo big. I could tell he was about to apologize again.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Where are you from?&#x201d; I blurted, hoping to shift his attention.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Winnetka, Illinois. I&#x2019;m going to Cal.&#x201d; Seeing my confusion, he explained, &#x201c;The University of California. It&#x2019;s over there.&#x201d; He pointed east. &#x201c;In Berkeley. I live in a fraternity house. How about you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Plain City, Ohio.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t heard of it, but we&#x2019;re both from the Midwest, and our states are practically neighbors. Friends?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I nodded. He sure was a nice guy&#x2014;-good--looking, and I liked the way the left side of his mouth tweaked up when he smiled.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Whew!&#x201d; He wiped his forehead in mock relief.<br>&nbsp;<br>He was funny too.<br>&nbsp;<br>When we had all reached the trailer, a man&#x2014;-wearing gray flannel trousers, a leather jacket zipped halfway up his chest, and a charcoal--colored trilby pulled down to shield his eyes from the sun&#x2014;-jumped on a crateand spoke above the din around us: &#x201c;A lot of you have come from far away. That&#x2019;s great! We need plenty of folks to get this place up and running. If you&#x2019;re a painter, electrician, or plumber, head over to the Court of the Seven Seas. Harry will lead the way.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Half the folks followed the man pointed out as Harry.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I figure the rest of you are here to apply for either service or performance jobs,&#x201d; the man in the trilby continued. &#x201c;If you want to drive one of the elephant trams, work in a concession, become a rolling--chairboy, barker, waitress, fireman, or cop, then go to the Court of Flowers. No flowers there yet, just another trailer like this one.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s my cue,&#x201d; Joe whispered. Then, &#x201c;Good luck!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He peeled away with a large group. He turned to look back at me, gave me a thumbs--up and another smile, both of which I returned. He strode with such confidence that dust kicked up around his shoes. Through theracket around me, I could just make out him whistling &#x201c;All of Me.&#x201d; I loved that song.<br>&nbsp;<br>The man in the hat sized up those who remained. &#x201c;All right then,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re here to be models, dancers, or musicians, you&#x2019;re with me. I&#x2019;ll see you one at a time. After a preliminary look--see, I&#x2019;ll sendyou on to auditions. If you make the cut&nbsp;. . . Aw, hell,&#x201d; he said with a casual wave of his hand. &#x201c;You know the drill. Line up here.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>One person after another entered the trailer and then exited five or so minutes later with either a grin or a grimace. I tried to prepare myself for the questions I might be asked about my dance experience, andonce again my father came into my mind. He may have beat me at home, but he liked to boast to others about how many ribbons and apple--pie prizes I&#x2019;d won. He&#x2019;d pushed me to be an &#x201c;all--American girl,&#x201d; which meant that he let me go to the Rialto to watch musicalsto inspire me to practice even harder. I adored Eleanor Powell in <i>Broadway Melody of 1936,</i> in which she danced without music. I saw that movie maybe ten times, and then tried to re--create her steps at every opportunity: on the sidewalk outside the theater,at Miss Mil-ler&#x2019;s studio, and in our family&#x2019;s laundry. Of course, the kids in school made fun of me when I said I wanted to be a star. &#x201c;You? An Oriental girl?&#x201d; They had a point. It wasn&#x2019;t like there were any famous Chinese movie stars apart from Anna May Wong,and she didn&#x2019;t sing or dance as far as I knew. Then I saw Dorothy Toy and Paul Wing&#x2014;-a <i>Chinese</i> dance team&#x2014;-in the whimsically titled <i>With Best Dishes.</i> I decided if they could make it, why not me? But would any of that help me now? I suddenly feltvery apprehensive and very alone.<br>&nbsp;<br>When my turn came, I entered the trailer and closed the door behind me as I&#x2019;d seen others do. The man motioned for me to sit.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Your name?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Grace Lee.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;How old are you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Old enough to sing and dance,&#x201d; I answered pertly. I wanted to be a star, so no matter how desperate I was, I had to act like one. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m good.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The man pinched his chin as he considered my response.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re Oriental,&#x201d; he observed, &#x201c;and you&#x2019;re quite the knockout. Problem is, I don&#x2019;t have anything for you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I opened my purse, pulled out Miss Miller&#x2019;s clipping, and pushed it across the desk. &#x201c;It says here you need performers for the Cavalcade of the Golden West&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a big show. Hundreds of performers. But I don&#x2019;t need an Oriental girl.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What about at the Japanese Pavilion?&#x201d; I asked, my false confidence instantly eroding. &#x201c;I came from so far away. I really need a job.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the Depression, kid. Everyone needs a job.&#x201d; He glanced again at my application. &#x201c;And I hate to break it to you, but you aren&#x2019;t Japanese.

Can you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I shrugged. I&#x2019;d never seen a Japanese. I&#x2019;d never seen a Chinese either other than my mother, my father, and my own reflection in the mirror&#x2014;-and Anna May Wong, Toy and Wing, and a couple of Orientals playing maidsand butlers on the silver screen, but those weren&#x2019;t in real life&#x2014;-so how could I be certain of the difference between a Japanese and a Chinese? I only knew my mother&#x2019;s thin cheeks and chapped hands and my father&#x2019;s weathered face and wiry arms. Like that, myeyes began to well. What if I failed? What if I had to go home?<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have Orientals where I&#x2019;m from,&#x201d; I admitted, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;ve always heard that they all look alike.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Be that as it may, I&#x2019;ve been told to be authentic&nbsp;. . .&#x201d; He snapped his fingers. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got it. There&#x2019;s going to be a Chinese Village. Those folks are doing their own hiring. Maybe I can get you set as a dancerfrom China.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not <i>from</i> China. I was born here.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Unconcerned, he picked up the phone. I listened as he suggested me to the person I assumed was in charge of the Chinese Village. He dropped the receiver back in the cradle. &#x201c;They aren&#x2019;t hiring dancers in a permanentway. With all the troubles in China, it wouldn&#x2019;t be right.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Troubles in China? I&#x2019;d read about Germany&#x2019;s aggression in Europe in the <i>Plain City Advocate,</i> but the newspaper came out only once a week. It barely covered events in Europe and never in Asia, so I was ignorantabout all things Chinese except Chinese rice wine, which my mom made and sold out our back door on Friday and Saturday nights to the men in Plain City&#x2014;-a place as dry as chalk even after Prohibition ended. My mind pondered these things, but they were just adiversion from my panic.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What about on the Gayway?&#x201d; I remembered that from Miss Miller&#x2019;s advertisement.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a carnival. I don&#x2019;t see you there at all.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been to a carnival before&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Not like this one.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I can do it,&#x201d; I insisted, but he&#x2019;d better not try sending me to a hoochie--coochie tent like they had for men at the Plain City Fair. I&#x2019;d never do that.<br>&nbsp;<br>He shook his head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a regular China doll. If I put you in the Gayway, the men would eat you up.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>My five minutes were done, but the man didn&#x2019;t dismiss me. Instead, he stared at me, taking in my dress, my shoes, the way I&#x2019;d curled and combed my hair. I lowered my eyes and sat quietly. Perhaps it was proof ofhow the most innocent can remain safe&#x2014;-or that the man really was of good character&#x2014;-that he didn&#x2019;t try or even suggest any funny business.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do anything,&#x201d; I said, my voice now shaking, &#x201c;even if it&#x2019;s boring or menial&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not the way to sell yourself, kid.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I could work in a hamburger stand if I had to.

Whitney and Death Valley--and that relief exposes spectacular geology. These thirty driving and walking tours each weave the tale of a geological features or relationship in this land of extremes. Some sketches ponder questions that puzzle geologists: how do stones slide across Racetrack playa? Others spotlight the earth-sculpturing role of volcanoes and earthquakes: lava columns at Devils Postpile and fault scarps that shape a golf course. Still others focus on less obvious but equally powerful processes: boulders shattered by salt crystals and rocks blasted by windblown sand.</p><p>Robert P.

SIMAK produced some of the most iconic science fiction stories ever written. Born in 1904 on a farm in southwestern Wisconsin, Simak got a job at a small-town newspaper in 1929 and eventually became news editor of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, writing fiction in his spare time. Simak was best known for the book City, a reaction to the horrors of World War II, and for his novel Way Station. In 1953 City was awarded the International Fantasy Award, and in following years, Simak won three Hugo Awards and a Nebula Award. In 1977 he became the third Grand Master of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, and before his death in 1988, he was named one of three inaugural winners of the Horror Writers Association&#39;s Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement. DAVID W. WIXON was a close friend of Clifford D. Simak&#39;s. As Simak&#39;s health declined, Wixon, already familiar with science fiction publishing, began more and more to handle such things as his friend&#39;s business correspondence and contract matters. Named literary executor of the estate after Simak&#39;s death, Wixon began a long-term project to secure the rights to all of Simak&#39;s stories and find a way to make them available to readers who, given the fifty-five-year span of Simak&#39;s writing career, might never have gotten the chance to enjoy all of his short fiction. Along the way, Wixon also read the author&#39;s surviving journals and rejected manuscripts, which made him uniquely able to provide Simak&#39;s readers with interesting and thought-provoking commentary that sheds new light on the work and thought of a great writer.&#x201c;To read science-fiction is to read Simak. The reader who does not like Simak stories does not like science-fiction at all.&#x201d; &#x2014;Robert A.

"The tales of Greek mythology do not throw any clear light upon what early mankind was like," Hamilton explains in her introduction. "They do throw an abundance of light upon what early Greeks were like--a matter, it would seem, of more importance to us, who are their descendents intellectually, artistically, and politically. Nothing we learn about them is alien to ourselves." Fans of Greek mythology will find all the great stories and characters here--Perseus, Hercules, and Odysseus--each discussed in generous detail by the voice of an impressively knowledgeable and engaging (with occasional lapses) narrator. This is also an excellent primer for middle- and high-school students who are studying ancient Greek and Roman culture and literature. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>MONSTERS, MORTALS, GODS, AND WARRIORS<p>For over fifty years readers have chosen this book above all others to discover the thrilling, enchanting, and fascinating world of Western mythology. From Odysseus's adventure-filled journey to the Norse god Odin's effort to postpone the final day of doom, Edith Hamilton's classic collection not only retells these stories with brilliant clarity but shows us how the ancients saw their own place in the world and how their themes echo in our consciousness today. An essential part of every home library, MYTHOLOGY is the definitive volume for anyone who wants to know the key dramas, the primary characters, the triumphs, failures, fears, and hopes first narrated thousands of years ago -- and still spellbinding to this day.</p></p><h2>I&#39;ll Be Home for Christmas</h2><p>Toot goes to a family reunion in Scotland, promising Puddle that he&#39;ll be back in Woodcock Pocket in time for Christmas.

As in Holly Hobbie's earlier <i>Toot and Puddle</i>, Toot has the travel bug while Puddle contentedly tends the home fires. In his postcard from Scotland, Toot promises to be home for Christmas. But ice storms and delayed flights threaten to spoil the holiday plans... until an unexpected fellow traveler saves the day.<p> Hobbie's marvelous illustrations are filled with telling details and subtle wit: Toot caroling his heart out in an Edinburgh blizzard with a few sheep buddies; Puddle curled up in an armchair with crayons and holiday cards (signed with a blank space before "and Puddle," in anticipation of Toot's signature). The devotion the pigs share for each other is sweet, never sickly, and young readers with best friends will know exactly how they feel, being apart at a most important time.

It shows how to enter the timeless now to heal events that occurred in the past, and to correct the course of destiny. Dr. Villoldo discusses ways in which you can heal yourself and your loved ones by employing intention through practices used by shamans of the Americas&#x2014;which, until now, have been inaccessible to most of the world. The shamans of old called this journeying.&nbsp;In this book, you&#x2019;ll discover that you have a four-chambered heart in the same way you have a four-chambered soul. In the first chamber, you store away the memory of a wound that derailed your destiny. In the second, you keep the limiting beliefs and soul contracts that you entered into at the time of your loss. In the third, you recover the grace and trust that will make you whole again; and in the fourth, you remember the calling and mission that you choose to unfold in this lifetime. "While everyone has a future," Villoldo says, "only certain people have a destiny." This book shows you how to find and manifest yours.</p><p>Alberto Villoldo, Ph.D., has trained as a psychologist and medical anthropologist, and has practiced yoga for more than 25 years. He has traveled to the source of India&#x2019;s holy rivers in the Himalayas to rediscover the wisdom of the Sadhu, India&#x2019;s ancient shamans.

Born Janet Miriam Holland Taylor Caldwell in Manchester, England, she moved with her family to Buffalo, New York, in 1907. She started writing stories when she was eight years old and completed her first novel when she was twelve. Married at age eighteen, Caldwell worked as a stenographer and court reporter to help support her family and took college courses at night, earning a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Buffalo in 1931. She adopted the pen name Taylor Caldwell because legendary editor Maxwell Perkins thought her debut novel, <i>Dynasty of Death </i>(1938), would be better received if readers assumed it were written by a man. In a career that spanned five decades, Caldwell published forty novels, many of which were <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers. Her best-known works include the historical sagas <i>The Sound of Thunder </i>(1957), <i>Testimony of Two Men </i>(1968), <i>Captains and the Kings </i>(1972), and <i>Ceremony of the Innocent </i>(1976), and the spiritually themed novels <i>The Listener </i>(1960) and <i>No One Hears But Him </i>(1966). <i>Dear and Glorious Physician </i>(1958), a portrayal of the life of St. Luke, and <i>Great Lion of God</i> (1970), about the life of St. Paul, are among the bestselling religious novels of all time. Caldwell&#x2019;s last novel, <i>Answer as a Man</i> (1981), hit the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller list before its official publication date.

Casey's remarkable doctrine of Visionary Activist Astrology. In this reverently irreverent mystery school disguised as a book (in which each of the planetary gods is a professor), we are invited to think of our lives as spiritual detective novels. For example, Venus teaches us that our affinities and quirks are clues to our unique mission and contribution to the world. The astrological language of the psyche is a tool for deciphering and revitalizing this sense of mission. Casey teaches you how to expand your range of intimacy with the ten parts of yourself represented by the planets, here called gods. You will learn how to use this language to reverence and feed the forces of your psyche that connect you to very real external forces. This book intends to catalyze a movement to engage the imagination of all people with a sense of humor and a desire to do collaborative good in the world.<br><br>Expanding on the ideas first presented in her popular audiotape series, Inner and Outer Space, Casey explores the archetypes at the heart of human relationships, aspirations, and spiritual quests. In an engaging narrative enlivened by stories, fables, exercises, and meditations developed through her work as an astrological counselor, she provides a practical system of personal and collective liberation. Making the Gods Work for You provides us with innovative principles to live by and rituals inviting us to become active, dynamic participants in the dance of life. We can then become increasingly conscious players on the team of creation, capable of sharing our gifts with the world at this crucial historical time.</p><p>Like Joseph Campbell&#39;s &#34;The Power of Myth&#34; and Clarissa Pinkola Estes&#39; &#34;Women Who Run with the Wolves&#34;, Casey&#39;s book reveals a new way of using myth and symbols for self-understanding and to change life for the better. &#34;Caroline Casey is brilliant, charismatic, and hysterically funny, and she has a way with words and ideas that will take your breath away&#34;.--&#34;Common Boundary&#34;."Writing with wit, intelligence, and much good humor, Caroline W. Casey uses the symbolic language of astrology to clarify the nature of the universe and our place in it.

She remembers the exhilaration of whipping a snowball at a car and having it hit straight on. She remembers playing with the skin on her mother's knuckles, which "didn't snap back; it lay dead across her knuckle in a yellowish ridge." She remembers the compulsion to spend a whole afternoon (or many whole afternoons) endlessly pitching a ball at a target. In this intoxicating account of her childhood, Dillard climbs back inside her 5-, 10-, and 15-year-old selves with apparent effortlessness. The voracious young Dillard embraces headlong one fascination after another--from drawing to rocks and bugs to the French symbolists. "Everywhere, things snagged me," she writes. "The visible world turned me curious to books; the books propelled me reeling back to the world." From her parents she inherited a love of language--her mother's speech was "an endlessly interesting, swerving path"--and the understanding that "you do what you do out of your private passion for the thing itself," not for anyone else's approval or desire. And one would be mistaken to call the energy Dillard exhibits in <i>An American Childhood</i> merely youthful; "still I break up through the skin of awareness a thousand times a day," she writes, "as dolphins burst through seas, and dive again, and rise, and dive."<p>A book that instantly captured the hearts of readers across the country, <em>An American Childhood</em> is Pulitzer Prize-winning author Annie Dillard's poignant, vivid memoir of growing up in Pittsburgh in the 1950s.</p></p><h2>The New England Wild Flower Society Guide to Growing and Propagating Wildflowers of the United States and Canada</h2><p>A comprehensive, beautifully illustrated primer on the fine art of grown wildflowers covers the North American continent, providing would-be cultivators of these beautiful flowers plentiful expert advice.</p><p>The New England Wild Flower Society is the oldest plant conservation organization in North America. It celebrated its 100th birthday by publishing this beautiful and useful guide to identifying, growing, and propagating native wildflowers. <p> Cultivating and appreciating native flora is a first step towards ecological gardening, a concept whose time has come. By choosing to grow the plants that thrive naturally in the conditions your garden offers, you are working with rather than against nature, resulting in easier maintenance and a reduced need of water and chemicals. A great many of the very loveliest flowers are available as natives, such as columbines, iris, trout lilies, violets, trillium, and even orchids. The delicacy of the native species, their simple forms and unadorned beauty, make many of the cultivars we see in the nursery appear overdone and blowzy, like a girl who has overdressed for a party. Horticulturists have worked for years to make new colors, double forms, and larger, brighter flowers, but these small natives have all the appeal of the original, plus they naturally thrive in appropriate conditions. </p><p> More than a thousand species of flowers are discussed and pictured, with thorough information on native habitat, cultural requirements, propagation, and design considerations. At the back of the book are lists of plants ideal for specific situations and with certain characteristics; look here to find what species have large leaves or attract butterflies, as well as which do best in dry shade, rocky areas, bogs, and, perhaps most useful of all, which wildflowers are deer-resistant. <i>--Valerie Easton</i></p>&#34;In my mind [this] book is the best single source of wildflower propagation information available.&#34; -- Richard E.

The Democrats may be in the White House---but even President Clinton can't ruin this country in only four years, proclaims Rush. Conservatism's most outspoken champion, Rush leads the charge to embrace and defend the fundamental values that have shaped the American character---the same values that cause liberals to have conniptions. Ever the optimist, Rush sees the "pernicious liberal movement" as a philosophy whose inevitable demise will lead us back to the values that made America great. A must for the politically incorrect, and sure to be anther blockbuster audio bestseller, <i>See, I Told You So</i> is Rush at his best---revealing once again why his syndicated radio show reaches over 20 million listeners each week.Rush Limbaugh Rush Limbaugh was born in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, a &#34;quintessential Midwestern small town,&#34; where he fell in love with radio in elementary school.

As she rose through the ranks to become a clinic director, however, things started to shift. Finances grew tighter, clinic practices changed, and Abby became increasingly unsettled about what she was being asked to do. But it wasn&#x2019;t until she helped perform an actual abortion procedure that Abby fully realized what she&#x2019;d been a part of all those years. <br>In the pages of <i>Unplanned</i>, you&#x2019;ll also discover: <ul><li> What Abby found so attractive about the mission and goals of Planned Parenthood </li><li> The personal secret that Abby had kept buried for years</li><li> The things she&#x2019;d believed and told patients that she discovered not to be true </li><li> An insider&#x2019;s perspective on Planned Parenthood&#x2019;s practices as well as the heartfelt but misguided efforts of some radical antiabortion activists </li><li> The courage and resilience she&#x2019;s seen on both sides of the fence&#x2015;from staff members to clients in crisis to prayerful volunteers </li> </ul> A compelling story of crisis and change, <i>Unplanned</i> is also a reminder of how grace finds us in unlikely places, and how we can all reach out with love to those who stand on opposing sides. <br>Abby Johnson holds a B.S. in psychology from Texas A&amp;M University and an M.A. in counseling from Sam Houston State University.

NOT A NASTY, DIRTY, WET HOLE, FILLED WITH THE ENDS OF WORMS AND AN OOZY SMELL, NOR YET A DRY, BARE, SANDY HOLE WITH NOTHING IN IT TO SIT DOWN ON OR TO EAT: IT WAS A HOBBIT-HOLE, AND THAT MEANS COMFORT.<br><br>--J. R. R. TOLKIEN, THE HOBBIT<br><br>If you're wondering how I went from risk-averse nerd to globe-trotting Indiana Jones, it started in 2007 with a panic attack.<br><br>It happened while I was sitting on a plane flying home to San Diego, but it wasn't because I was afraid of flying. The issue was that I dreamed of traveling to far-off lands, doing exciting things, and living an epic life full of adventure, but my reality was drastically different from the dreams taking place in my head. After spending all day at a job I was ill-suited for, I would spend every night and weekend hiding behind my computer screen, emptying hour after hour into video games in order to escape an existence that could best be described as dull and directionless. I ate the same foods, did the same boring things, and put off any adventure and growth of any kind until things in my life were "less busy." I felt like I was having a midlife crisis at the age of 23. As Ben Franklin said, "Some people die at 25 and aren't buried until 75." I felt like he was speaking to me.<br><br>I wanted more out of life, but had no idea how to make it happen. I continued to escape into video games, books, and movies to live life through the eyes of characters whose lives seemed (and were) more exciting than mine. I zoned out every night in front of a screen, got drunk on the weekends to forget the previous week, and dreaded Sunday nights because I knew I'd have to wake up early the next morning and go back to a reality that I despised. I thought back to my youth and tried to figure out where things went wrong.<br><br>I had a very normal childhood. Well, if you can call growing up in a town called Sandwich "normal." To answer your first two questions, yes, our police cars say "Sandwich Police" on them, and no, our high school mascot is not a sandwich. As a young child, I had an overly active imagination, and split my free time equally between playing games like The Legend of Zelda and exploring my backyard as if I was Link, the tunic-wearing hero of that game. I honestly felt like I grew up alongside Link, watching him jump from a 2D sprite in A Link to the Past to a fully realized 3D badass in The Ocarina of Time, widely considered the greatest games of all time.<br><br>And then came my four years at Sandwich High School; as a sophomore I stood a towering 5'1", on year #3 of braces, and I somehow managed to get the acne that comes with puberty without the accompanying growth spurt. Finally, my exceptionally tall father's genetics kicked in, and I grew to 5'11" by the time I finished my junior year. The braces came off and two rounds of Accutane treatments helped clear up my skin. I even tried out for the varsity basketball team, as my brother was captain and I prided myself on trying really hard. Unfortunately, all the effort in the world couldn't mask the fact that I wasn't very good, and I got cut. Thus, the only two sports I ended up playing in high school were those generally recommended for geriatrics: golf and tennis. It was right around this time, too, that I managed to fall in love and spend all of my free time hopelessly addicted. Her name?<br><br>EverQuest.<br><br>For the unfamiliar, EverQuest is an immensely popular online multiplayer video game like World of Warcraft in which a world of wizards, warriors, and dragons reside. If you grew up playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons, think of this like its video game equivalent without a dungeon master. I didn't have my driver's license or a girlfriend, so my weekends and summer nights were spent exploring in a different way. Rather than actively exploring my backyard or new parts of town, I explored the game world of Norrath as Morphos Novastorm, an Erudite Wizard. No longer did I need to use my imagination to fill in the gaps, because Norrath had it all: massively high peaks, deep dark oceans full of secrets, deserted islands, haunted houses, caves, castles, and everything in between.<br><br>What had begun as a fun way to blow off some steam after school or work quickly became an addiction. I specifically remember a few nights after marathon gaming sessions in which I would quietly try to sneak up to bed so as to not wake my parents, only to bump into my dad who was getting ready for work. Sorry, Dad. There were quite a few days during the summer in which I stayed up all night trying to complete a particularly challenging quest, only to realize it was already time to go work a 12-hour shift at my summer day job, stocking shelves in busy supermarkets for Coca-Cola. It paid great, but boy was I miserable.<br><br>Although I dedicated a lot of my time to gaming after school and on weekends, I made sure to keep a strong focus on my academics, too. Having an older brother who graduated second in his class paved a nice path for me to put all sorts of unnecessary pressure on myself to follow in his footsteps. I joined every club I could, served on student council, got the best grades I could, and managed to graduate second in my small class as well. Eventually, I chose to attend Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. I didn't know much about the school other than the fact that it had a great reputation and nicer weather than the Northeast, so when they offered me a decent academic scholarship I decided to visit the campus and instantly fell in love with it.<br><br>My four years of college progressed rather quickly. I wasn't sure what I wanted to be when I grew up--and I still don't know--so I bounced between majors before finally settling on economics. I loved college. Not because I could party all the time--I actually didn't start drinking until my senior year. I loved college because I had freedom and a computer with max specifications that could run the best games at the highest resolution. My roommates and I pooled our money together to buy a big TV and every available game system, and we spent hours upon hours playing Super Smash Bros., Halo, Mario Kart, Resident Evil, and every role-playing game (RPG) we could find. It was in the fall of my junior year that EverQuest 2 was released, and my love affair with online video games began anew. In between classes, after class, before going out on weekends (or instead of going out on weekends), and instead of writing papers, my time went into leveling up my character in the newly designed Norrath.<br><br>As graduation neared and I still had zero plans for my future, my brother Jack contacted me from a frozen Chicago to tell me he wanted me to move with him to San Diego, California. Because I had no other plans, I quickly consented, and after graduating I moved out West and took the highest paying job I could find in an industry that would have me: construction equipment rental and sales. I figured, "How hard could it be? I like talking to people, and both of my parents are in sales!"<br><br>We lived 20 yards from the beach, I surfed when I could, I had a company car, a steady salary, and a job that kept me busy, and I was miserable. Every morning hit me like a sack of hammers, and I quickly counted down the minutes until my shift ended and I could go home. I certainly don't mean to knock the construction industry or sales, it's just that it only took me a few days to realize that I was simply mismatched and terrible at it. Fortunately, I had a wallet full of money and a computer that could run EverQuest 2. So afternoons were spent playing video games, weekends were spent getting drunk at bars or drinking and playing EverQuest, and Sundays were reserved for walking along the beach, fighting back tears, wondering what's wrong, and asking myself, "Am I really supposed to be this unhappy for the next forty years?"<br><br>Even though I wasn't great at my job, I tried to tough things out and did so for over a year, hoping things would improve. Spoiler alert: they didn't. In fact, things got worse! My boss had GPS devices installed on our sales trucks, and I vividly remember one morning getting a phone call from the boss man at 7:05 a.m. "Steve," he said. "I can see that your truck is still parked in front of your house. Why haven't you left yet? Your day should start at seven a.m." Not to be outsmarted, I simply drove from job site to job site, quickly made my sales pitches and usually got rejected, and then sat in my truck and read Harry Potter novels for 20 minutes before repeating the process until my work day was over. As an overachiever in high school, I couldn't help but think about how far I had fallen in just a few short years. Honestly, I'm thankful I was so miserable and mismatched with that job, as a somewhat happier existence might not have spurred me to action!<br><br>Now, it was right around this time that I had the aforementioned panic attack on the airplane and decided some adventure was in order. I had just spent an amazing weekend back in Nashville with all of my college friends for a reunion, and, for the first time in over a year, I was truly happy.<br><br>I walked off that plane a different man and decided I needed to make a change. I reached out to the friends I had just visited, who informed me they were in search of a third roommate for their new apartment in Atlanta. I woke up the next morning, marched into my brother's room, and let him know I had to move to Atlanta as quickly as possible. Fortunately he was incredibly supportive and helped me begin my job search; my boss was less enthusiastic about the idea.<br><br>While checking Craigslist, I stumbled across a posting online for a job that required "creativity, a love of music, and willingness to travel." Even though it was a subentry level position, it was with a company named Sixthman that gave me a warm fuzzy feeling. Sixthman produces floating music festivals by chartering cruise ships and filling them up with music acts of various genres.<br><br>During the interview process, I was asked which movie had inspired me the most. Having just gone through a perfectly mundane and boring existence out in California, I went on and on about the movie The Shawshank Redemption, in which an inmate refuses to let his prison walls beat him down or change him. As luck would have it, Shawshank also happened to be the favorite movie of the owner of the company, and I was brought on as a marketing assistant.<br><br>Although I earned less than half of what I'd been making out in San Diego, I absolutely loved the job: I worked with people I admired, I made an immediate impact, and my day-to-day office life always built up to an amazing event with incredible musicians. On one cruise, the company tasked me to write about my experiences onboard: my first creative writing assignment. After sharing my work with the company, I was soon put in charge of the company blog, and I fell in love with using written words to share stories and inspire people to live a life of fun.<br><br>Now, although I enjoyed my time on these cruises and in the office, whenever it was possible I still poured dozens of hours into EverQuest 2. Deep down, I knew something was still missing. I no longer dreaded Mondays, and I had plenty of things in my life to look forward to, but something inside me told me my future still lay elsewhere. A year prior I had purchased the domain NerdFitness.com, a half-baked idea I had to help nerds like myself not make all of the mistakes I had made in the gym trying to get healthy. I enjoyed exercising, but increasingly saw my fitness and my dreams of building a company get put on the back burner as more and more time was required of my wizard, Morphos Novastorm.<br><br>And then fate intervened again. While on a taxing dungeon raid in EverQuest, the fan in the computer I had built burned out, and many of the internal components fried. It was then that I made a commitment to myself: because I lacked the money to fix or replace the computer, I wouldn't allow myself to play EverQuest again until I had actually done something with Nerd Fitness. I spent the next 18 months leading a double life; during the day I was the marketing guy for Sixthman, while at night I worked on Nerd Fitness--writing articles, connecting with readers, and helping others make better food and exercise decisions. I didn't get much sleep, but I spent most of my days smiling, happy, and freaking wired: I had finally found my path. True growth and adventure had thus far eluded me, but it was getting closer by the day. And that's when my life started to get interesting.<br><br>After those 18 months working on Nerd Fitness on nights and weekends, it became clear to me that my destiny and future lay with the website and community I was building. So I made the brutally difficult decision to walk away from a great job and devote myself full-time to helping people live healthier lives. Fortunately, my boss understood completely and asked how he could support my dream. To this day Andy and I remain great friends, and I count him as a trusted advisor. I picked up odd jobs here and there to make ends meet while Nerd Fitness grew--including pushing around heavy concert gear, working beer stands at festivals, painting soundstage floors late into the night--and put a focus on the true life I wanted to build for myself.</p><h2>The Histories (Barnes &amp; Noble Classics)</h2><p><i>The Histories</i>, by <b>Herodotus</b>, is part of the <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i><i>&nbsp;</i>series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

His scholarship focuses on Homer and Herodotus. He has published a book on each. He also researches nonverbal behaviors in ancient literature.<b>From Donald Lateiner's Introduction to <i>The Histories</i><br><br></b>"Herodotus sometimes writes for children and sometimes for philosophers," said the greatest of modern historians, Edward Gibbon (<i>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>, 1776-1788, chapter 24, note 54). Casual and serious readers alike have loved the first historian, the inventor of history, for his narrative genius and tragi-comic view of human events, great and small. He has been equally criticized and damned by professional historians, ethnographers, and geographers for errors of fact and method, and even for his Greek. Cicero was not the first to call him "the father of lies." The German scholar Detlev Fehling (see "For Further Reading") actually avers that he never left Greece or perhaps even his Anatolian study, copying others' lies and travelers' tales, inventing claims of visits to exotic places and familiar monuments, and fabricating hundreds of alleged sources.<br>Whereas other ancient historians who followed his large footsteps narrowed their scope in terms of topic (Thucydides, Polybius, Sallust), time (Theopompus, Livy, Tacitus), or territory (the local historians, such as those of Athens, the Atthidographers, or the chroniclers of other <i>poleis</i>), Herodotus Homerically encompasses vast realms in topic, time, and territory. After leaving his birthplace, Halicarnassos on the western edge of Asia Minor (Anatolia, now roughly Turkey), he sailed on various voyages, perhaps as a merchant, south to Egypt, east to Sidon, north to the Hellespont and Black Sea, and west to Italy and Sicily. He then traveled inland in all these directions, although one cannot always separate his reports based on personal visits from what he heard or thought he heard, through interpreters who were sometimes comparatively informed and sometimes no better than local loungers eager to help a tourist. He saw the earth beneath his feet and existing structures at Delphi, Marathon, and Delos. He traveled to the edges of the known and unknown inhabited world in Egypt and Italy, and around the Black Sea. He heard about Spain, Babylon (in modern Iraq), Afghanistan, cold Britain, and the hot Sahara. This last region, described with wonder and some disparagement in the latter half of book IV, is crucial to the story of Ondaatje's protagonist in <i>The English Patient</i>, a Central European explorer of North Africa. Herodotus was his guide in those vast spaces, and he was never separated from this talisman, a kind of Bible for his restless search in life.<br>Herodotus&#x2014;the inquirer, evaluator, and judge (a combination of the three is what "historian" means in Greek)<b>&#x2014;</b>tells us what he observed. He saw pyramids, inscriptions, and other natural and artificial alterations of the environment. He heard facts and fictions from combatants, travelers, and survivors. He gathered legends and anecdotes from oral traditional tales. And he surmised certain things to be possible or probable from his own penetrating critiques of humans, their normal and odd behaviors, and their environment. Some of his alleged errors turn out to be misunderstandings of what he wrote. Some real errors (such as his disbelief [4.42] in the possibility of Phoenician circumnavigation of Africa) derive from his honest mistakes in a young and illiterate world without prose books&#x2014;his was one of the first and certainly the most ambitious work of research to his day. <br><br>Notwithstanding the somewhat exceptional case of the Athenians and the unavailability of scribal records of the Eastern autocracies, his world possessed few public records, no libraries or databases, only many personal and parochial biases and foreign tongues. His sources and source materials include Egyptian, African, Persian, Phoenician, Scythian, Celtic, and Ethiopian as well as Greek information. For one exotic example, his account of gold-digging, furry giant ants in the northeastern corner of the Persian Empire (Pactyike; 3.102-105) may have misreported, through many intermediary sources, the habits of a larger animal. The large burrowing marmots of the Dansar plateau, which overlooks the Indus in Kashmir, may have given rise to Herodotus' bizarre account of mining insects; see Michel Peissel's <i>The Ants' Gold: The Discovery of the Greek El Dorado in the Himalayas</i> (1984)<b></b> and an article<i></i> by Marlise Simons ("Gold-Digging Ants' Mystery Seems Solved, After Bugging Scholars for Centuries"; <i>New York Times</i>, November 25, 1996). In "The Place of Herodotus in the History of Historiography," the eminent student of ancient historiography Arnaldo Momigliano wrote: "If we had to give an <i>a priori</i> estimate of . . . success in writing history by Herodotus' method, we should probably shake our heads in sheer despondency."</p><h2>Steamboat Entertains: Winning Recipes from Ski Town USA</h2><p>These recipes were collected from famous ski champions, renowed local chefs, true gourmands, and infamous local cooks.

These insightful essays are the result of a remarkable dialogue between the two men, sponsored by the Catholic Academy of Bavaria, a little over a year before Joseph Ratzinger was elected pope.</p><p><p><b>Joseph Ratzinger</b> (Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI)&nbsp;is recognized as one of the most brilliant theologians and spiritual leaders of our age. As pope he authored the best-selling&nbsp;<i>Jesus of Nazareth</i>. Prior to his pontificate, he wrote many influential books important for the contemporary Church, such as &nbsp;<i>Introduction to Christianity&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Spirit of the Liturgy.</i></p>Is a public culture of reason and ordered liberty possible in our post-metaphysical age? Is philosophy permanently cut adrift from its grounding in being and anthropology? Does this decline of rationality signal an opportunity or a deep crisis for religion itself? These are truly urgent questions, discussed by two of the greatest thinkers of our time, Jurgen Habermas and Joseph Ratzinger. -- <i>Russell Hittinger</i><br><br>This book may be small in its number of pages, but it is large in its warning of a disintegration of western culture as it enters the global age. -- <i>Dr. Raymond Dennehy</i></p><h2>Spandau: The Secret Diaries</h2><p>He served as Hitler's architect, the undisputed master of the German war machine, and the one responsible for conscripted foreign labor in the Third Reich. And, when Albert Speer was captured and sentenced at Nuremberg--after becoming the only defendant to plead guilty--he started keeping this secret diary, much of it on toilet paper. After 20 years of imprisonment, he found 25,000 of the smuggled pages waiting for him, and from those entries he shaped this deeply powerful document. "Albert Speer's book is a deeply moving document. It is also of extraordinary political and psychological interest...a must for anyone interested in psychological motivation of political action and the problem of guilt and repentance. But, beyond this it is so fascinatingly written that I could not put it down before I finished it." --<i>Erich Fromm</i>.<br></p><p>Albert Speer (March 19, 1905 &#x2013; September 1, 1981) was a German architect who was, for part of World War II, Minister of Armaments and War Production for the Third Reich. Speer was Adolf Hitler's chief architect before assuming ministerial office. As "the Nazi who said sorry", he accepted responsibility at the Nuremberg trials and in his memoirs for crimes of the Nazi regime. His level of involvement in the persecution of the Jews and his level of knowledge of the Holocaust remain matters of dispute. As Hitler's Minister of Armaments and War Production, Speer was so successful that Germany's war production continued to increase despite massive and devastating Allied bombing. After the war, he was tried at Nuremberg and sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the Nazi regime, principally for the use of forced labour. He served his full sentence, most of it at Spandau Prison in West Berlin. Following his release from Spandau in 1966, Speer published two bestselling autobiographical works, Inside the Third Reich and Spandau: The Secret Diaries, detailing his often close personal relationship with Hitler, and providing readers and historians with a unique perspective within the workings of the Nazi regime. He later wrote a third book, Infiltration, about the SS. Speer died of natural causes in 1981 while on a visit to London.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>The Way and Its Power, A Study of the Tao Te Ching and Its Place in Chinese Thought</h2><p>First published in 1934.<br><br>Unlike previous translations, this translation of Lao Tzu's <em>Tao T� Ching</em> is based not on the medieval commentaries but on a close study of the whole of early Chinese literature.</p><p>Lao Tzu&#39;s Tao Te Ching is one of the most important and profound texts of world literature. A guide to transcending everyday appearances and dilemmas in order to find peace in the immortal spirit of Tao, the book is divided into eighty-one short sections that are both eloquent and inspiring. This edition of Arthur Waley&#39;s definitive translation includes a comprehensive introduction, commentary, and notes section and offers the reader a perfect introduction to this timeless spiritual document.</p><h2>America</h2><p>Photographs portray American celebrities and areas of the country such as Texas, New York City, and Washington, D.C</p><p>Andy Warhol (1928-1987) was a painter, graphic artist filmmaker, and leader of the Pop Art movement. He also produced a significant body of film work, including the famous Chelsea Girls. Equally well known in the late Sixties and early Seventies as resident host at his studio, the Factory. Andy Warhol died following gall bladder surgery, in New York on the 22nd February 1987. As Warhol said: &#39;I never think that people die. They just go to department stores.&#39;Warhol carries a camera everywhere he goes. He shoots celebrities, entertain ers, writers, avant-garde artists, body- builders, wrestlers, eccentrics, and ur ban street poor. This collection has been selected from a 10-year archive. Warhol's eye catches the odd contra diction, the outlandish, the amusing, the touching. It is never contemptuous. The cumulative effect tells us some thing about contemporary America be yond the familiar picture-magazine view.

Most people think Walter Cronkite was the first to tell America about the assassination. But when Cronkite broke the news on TV, he read from one of Smith&#x2019;s dispatches. At Parkland Hospital, Smith saw President Kennedy&#x2019;s blood-soaked body in the back of his limousine before the emergency room attendants arrived. Two hours later, he was one of three journalists to witness President Johnson&#x2019;s swearing-in aboard Air Force One. Smith rightly won a Pulitzer Prize for the vivid story he wrote for the next day&#x2019;s morning newspapers.<br><br>Smith&#x2019;s scoop is journalism legend. But the full story of how he pulled off the most amazing reportorial coup has never been told. As the top White House reporter of his time, Smith was a bona fide celebrity and even a regular on late-night TV. But he has never been the subject of a biography.<br><br>With access to a trove of Smith&#x2019;s personal letters and papers and through interviews with Smith&#x2019;s family and colleagues, veteran news reporter Bill Sanderson will crack open the legend. <i>Bulletins from Dallas</i> tells for the first time how Smith beat his competition on the story, and shows how the biggest scoop of his career foreshadowed his personal downfall.<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.</p><p>Bill Sanderson spent almost two decades as a reporter and editor at the New York Post. His work has also appeared in the Wall Street Journal, New York Observer, and the Washington Post. Sanderson lives in New York City."I thoroughly enjoyed Bulletins From Dallas ... I had only known the briefest superficial story about Merriman Smith&#x2014;that he was a dogged reporter with great access to LBJ and a Pulitzer to his credit for his JFK reporting. <i>Bulletins</i> opened up a fresh and thoroughly engaging world of a very unpleasant and troubled man who was nevertheless at times a gifted reporter. I've recommended this book book to quite a few people, especially journalist friends and JFK readers."&#x2014;Gerald Posner, author of <i>Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK</i><br><br> So much of what we know about any story depends on how reporters do their work. <b>Bill Sanderson takes us through every heartbreaking minute of one of the biggest stories of our lifetime</b>, with sharp detail and powerful observations.

His skills were quite good then. They are superb today. <b>I have read many accounts of the JFK assassination, but none has been anything like <i>Bulletins from Dallas</i></b>. This is the in-your-face story of Merriman Smith, the iconic UPI reporter who was in the President&#x2019;s motorcade and first told the world in real time, as it existed in 1963, what was happening to JFK. <b><i>Bulletins</i> is a page turner</b>, and only a reporter with Sanderson&#x2019;s skills could have brought us so realistically back to Dallas through the sharp eyes and the meticulous work of the most significant journalist of the era.&#x201d;<br> <b>Hon.

It&#x2019;s a clinic on how to be a newspaper journalist circa 1963, one with equal measures of precision and emotion. Smith was the Dean of White House reporters of his day, a man who could dictate perfect copy off the top of his head,&#x2019; whose punctuation was unerring. Such focus and determination, and a competitive spirit that led him to beat out the AP especially on the JFK assassination story, makes this book exciting reading. You&#x2019;ll want to be a reporter even as the species is endangered. Merriman Smith, unlike other sycophantic reporters, did not worship his subjects. Wisely, he offered his allegiance not to individuals, but to the White House itself. <b>This is an important book and a must for anyone interested in how a seasoned reporter covered the JFK assassination without mythologizing or distorting available history</b>.&#x201d;<br> <b>Joan Mellen</b>, author of <i>A Farewell to Justice</i> and <i>The Great Game in Cuba</i><br><br> Bill Sanderson provides readers <b>a probing, in-depth look at one of the most fascinating journalists of the twentieth century</b>. From Franklin Roosevelt to Richard Nixon, Merriman Smith was a front row observer to people and events that shaped the course of history Truman&#x2019;s decision to use the atomic bomb, the turbulence of the Civil Rights Movement, LBJ&#x2019;s ill-advised and misguided conduct of the Vietnam War. And, of course, President Kennedy&#x2019;s assassination. In <i>Bulletins from Dallas</i>, the author uncovers new observations of and insights into Smitty&#x2019;s&#x201d; reporting on that tragic day, as well as compelling stories and anecdotes about the journalist&#x2019;s personal life and struggles. <b>Anyone interested in presidential history, journalism, and that fateful day in Dallas, will love this read.</b> I certainly did.&#x201d; <b>Dean R.

He has also done his own research, corroborating for example the report that Jack Ruby was at Parkland Hospital when the president died.

Should one forgive abusers? Ought we not hope for the final reconciliation of all the wronged and all wrongdoers alike, even if it means spending eternity with perpetrators of evil? We live in an age when it is generally accepted that past wrongs - genocides, terrorist attacks, bald personal injustices - should be constantly remembered. But Miroslav Volf here proposes the radical idea that letting go of such memories - after a certain point and under certain conditions - may actually be the appropriate course of action. While agreeing with the claim that to remember a wrongdoing is to struggle against it, Volf notes that there are too many ways to remember wrongly, perpetuating the evil committed rather than guarding against it. In this way, the just sword of memory often severs the very good it seeks to defend. He argues that remembering rightly has implications not only for the individual but also for the wrongdoer and for the larger community. Volfs personal stories of persecution offer a compelling backdrop for his search for theological resources to make memories a wellspring of healing rather than a source of deepening pain and animosity. Controversial, thoughtful, and incisively reasoned, The End of Memory begins a conversation hard to ignore.</p><p>Miroslav Volf is Director of the Yale Center for Faith and Culture and Henry B.

He was bleeding from a wound in the neck, where one of the razor-sharp shards of ice the creatures hurled like javelins had slipped beneath the rim of his helmet. The young fool was fortunate to be alive, and neck wounds were notoriously treacherous. If he didn't stop flailing about and have it attended to, it might tear wider and cost the Legion an irreplaceable asset.</p> <p>High Lord Antillus Raucus adjusted his own windstream to match the young Knight's dive and followed him down toward the embattled Third Antillan Legion upon the Shieldwall. "You!" he snarled, passing the young Knight without particular effort by his own, far-stronger furies. What was the idiot's name? Marius? Karius? Carlus, that was it. "Sir Carlus, get to the healers. Now."</p><p>Carlus's eyes went wide with shock as Raucus shot ahead, leaving the younger man behind as if he had been hovering in place instead of power diving for the earth at his most reckless speed. Raucus heard him say, "Yes, my l&#x2014; But the rest of the word vanished into the gale roar of the High Lord's windcrafted wake.</p><p>Raucus bid his furies to enhance his sight, and the scene below him sprang into magnified vision. He assessed the Legion's situation as he swept down upon them. Raucus spat out an oath. His captain had been right to send for aid. </p><p>The Third Antillan's situation was desperate.</p><p>Raucus had cut his teeth in battle at fourteen years of age. In the forty years since, scarcely a month had passed in which he had not seen action of one scale or another, defending the Shieldwall against the constant menace of the primitive Icemen of the north.</p><p>In all that time, he had never, not once, seen so many of them.</p><p>A sea of the savages spread out from the Shieldwall, tens of thousands strong, and as Raucus dived closer, he was suddenly enveloped by a chill far deeper than the mere bite of winter. Within seconds, crystalline laceworks of frost had formed across the surface of his armor, and he had to begin the familiar effort of low-grade firecrafting to ward away the cold.</p><p>The enemy had built mounds of snow and corpses against the Shieldwall, piling them into ramps. It was a tactic he had seen before, in the most determined assaults. The Legion had responded with their usual doctrine&#x2014;burning oil and blasts of fire from their Knights Ignus.</p><p>The wall itself was very nearly a feature of the land, a massive edifice of granite furycrafted from the bones of the earth, fifty feet tall and twice as thick. It must have cost the Icemen thousands of lives to mount those ramps, to see them melted down, and to mount them again, and again, and again&#x2014;but they had done it. The cold had lasted long enough to sap the <i>legionares</i> of their strength, and the battle had raged long enough to wear the Third's Knights down, until they could no longer sustain the effort needed to keep the foe at bay.</p><p>The Icemen had gained the wall itself.</p><p>Raucus felt his teeth clench in frustration and rage as the apelike creatures swarmed over the breach in the defenses. The largest of the brutes was as tall as an Aleran <i>legionare</i>, but far broader across the shoulders, far thicker through the chest. Their arms were long, with enormous hands, and their leathery hides were layered with a sparse coating of wiry, yellow-white fur that could make them all but invisible in the frozen wastes of the north. Yellow-white eyes glared from beneath shaggy brows, and a pair of heavy tusks jutted up from massively muscled jaws. Each Iceman bore a club of bone or stone in his hands, some of them edged with chips of sharp, unnaturally hard ice that, like the cold of the winter itself, seemed to bend itself to the will of the savages.</p><p>The <i>legionares</i> rallied behind the crested helmet of a centurion, struggling to push forward and seal the breach&#x2014;but the furycraftings that were supposed to keep the top of the wall clear of ice were failing, and their footing had become treacherous. Their foe, more at home on the slippery surface, began to drive the Legion back into a pair of separate, vulnerable elements, as more and more of their kind surged onto the wall.</p><p>The yellow-eyed sons of crows were killing his men.</p><p>The Third Antillan had minutes of life left in it, and after that, the Icemen would be through them, and that horde would be free to ravage the lands beyond. There were a dozen steadholts and three small towns within a few hours' march for the horde, and though the militia of every town along the Shieldwall was well maintained and diligent in its continued training&#x2014;Raucus would permit nothing less&#x2014;against such an enormous number of the foe, they would be able to do nothing but die in a futile effort to allow their women and children time to flee.</p><p>He wouldn't allow it to happen. Not to his people. Not to his lands.</p><p>Antillus Raucus, High Lord of Antillus, let the rage boil up inside him in a white-hot fire as he swept his sword from its sheath at his side. He opened his mouth in a wordless roar of pure wrath, bellowing to his furies, calling out to the land around him, to <i>his</i> land, which for a lifetime he had fought to defend, as had his father, and his father, and his father before him.</p><p>The Aleran High Lord screamed his outrage to the land and the sky.</p><p>And the land and the sky gave answer.</p><p>The clear twilight air boiled and blackened with storm clouds, and dark streamers of mist followed him in a spiral as he dived. Thunder magnified the High Lord's battle cry tens of thousands of times over. Raucus felt his rage flow into the sword in his hand, and the blade burst into scarlet flame, burning through the cold air in a sizzling hiss, lighting the sky around him as if the sun had suddenly risen back above the horizon.</p><p>Light fell onto the desperate <i>legionares</i>, and faces began to turn skyward. A sudden roar of hope and wild excitement rose from the Legion, and lines that had begun to buckle abruptly locked into place again, shields binding together, firming, holding.</p><p>It took a few seconds more before the first of the Icemen began to look up, and only then, as Raucus readied himself to enter the fray, did the High Lord unleash the furies of his skies against the foe.</p><p>Lightning came down from the sky in threads so tiny and numerous that more than anything, they resembled burning rain. Blue-white bolts raked the Icemen on the ground below the shield, killing and burning, sending Icemen into screaming confusion&#x2014;and suddenly choking the pressure of their advance onto the wall.</p><p>Raucus flung his sword's point down as he closed on the exact center of the Icemen's position atop the wall, and called fire from the burning blade, sending out a white-hot column of flame that charred flesh to ash and blackened bone in a circle fifteen feet across. At the last second, he called upon his wind furies to slow him, landed hard upon the unyielding stone of the wall&#x2014;now cleared of the treacherous ice.</p><p>Raucus called strength up from the earth, shattered two hurled clubs with sweeps of his burning blade, swept a wave of fire over a hundred of the foe between himself and the southern side of the wall, then began grimly hacking his way northward. The Icemen were no fools. They knew that even the mightiest furycrafter could be felled if enough spears and arrows and clubs were thrown at them&#x2014;and Raucus knew it, too.</p><p>But before the shocked Icemen could coordinate their attacks, the High Lord of Antillus was among them with his deadly sword, giving them no chance to overwhelm his defenses with a storm of missiles&#x2014;and no Iceman alive, no dozen of the savages, was the match for the skill Antillus Raucus with steel in his hand.</p><p>The Icemen fought with savage ferocity, each of them possessed of far more strength than a man&#x2014;but not more than an enraged High Lord, drawing power from the stones of the land itself. Twice, Icemen managed to seize Raucus with their huge, leathery hands. He broke their necks with the use of one hand and flung the corpses through several ranks of the enemy around him, knocking down dozens at a time.</p><p>"Third Antillan!" Raucus bellowed, all the while. "To me! Antillus, to me! Antillus, for Alera!"</p><p>"Antillus for Alera!" came the thunder of his <i>legionares'</i> reply, and his soldiers began to reverse the tide and drive the foe from the walls. The veteran <i>legionares</i>, bellowing their war cry, fought their way to the side of their lord, hammering their way through the enemy who had been close to overwhelming them moments before.</p><p>The enemy resistance melted abruptly, vanishing like sand washed away by a tide, and Raucus sensed the change in pressure. The Third Aleran's Knights Ferrous cut their way to his side and fell in on his flanks, and after that, it was only a matter of dispatching the animals who remained on the wall.</p><p>"Shields!" Raucus barked, mounting up on a crenel, where he could overlook the Icemen's snow ramp below. A pair of <i>legionares</i> immediately came to his side, covering all three of them with their broad shields. Spears, arrows, and thrown clubs hammered against the Aleran steel.</p><p>Raucus focused his attention on the snow ramp. Fire would melt it, right enough, but it would be an enormous effort. Easier to shake it apart from beneath. He nodded sharply to himself, laid a bare hand on the stone of the Shieldwall, and sent his attention down through the stones. With an effort of will, he bade the local furies to move, and the ground outside the Shieldwall suddenly rippled and heaved.</p><p>The great structure of ice cracked and groaned&#x2014;and then collapsed, taking a thousand screaming savages with it.</p><p>Raucus rose, nudging the shields aside, as a great cloud of ice crystals leapt into the air. He gripped the burning sword in hand, and stared out intently, waiting for his view of the enemy. For a moment, no one on the wall moved, as they waited to see through the cloud of snow.</p><p>There was a cry from farther down the line, one of triumph, and a moment later the air cleared enough to show Raucus the enemy, routed and in full retreat.</p><p>Then, and only then, did Raucus let the fire fade from his sword.</p><p>His men crowded against the edge of the wall, screaming their defiance and triumph at the retreating enemy. They were chanting his name.</p><p>Raucus smiled and saluted them, fist to heart. It was what one did. If it gave his men joy to cheer him, he'd be even more of a heartless bastard than he was not to let them have their moment. They didn't need to know that the smile was a false one.</p><p>There were too many still, silent forms in Antillan armor for it to be genuine.</p><p>The efforts of the day's furycrafting had exhausted him, and he wanted nothing so much as a quiet patch of dry, flat space to go to sleep on. Instead, he conferred with his captain and the Third's staff, then went to the healer's tents to visit the wounded. </p><p>Like accepting cheers, one didn't deserve, it was also what one did. </p><p>Those men lying wounded had become so in service to him. They had suffered their pains for him. He could lose an hour of sleep, or two, or ten, if it meant easing that pain for a few moments for the cost of nothing more than a few kind words.</p><p>Sir Carlus was the last of those Raucus visited. The young man was still fairly groggy. His injuries had been more extensive than he had known, and the watercrafting that had healed them had left him exhausted and disoriented. Neck injuries could be that way. Something to do with the brain, Raucus had been told.</p><p>"Thank you, my lord," Carlus said, when Raucus sat down on one edge of his bunk. "We couldn't have held without you."</p><p>"We all fight together, lad," Raucus replied roughly. "No thanks need be given. We're the best. It's how we do our work. How we do our duty. Next time, it could be the Third saving me."</p><p>"Yes, my lord," Carlus said. "Sir? Is it true what they say? That you challenged the First Lord to the<i> juris macto</i>?"</p><p>Raucus snorted out a quiet laugh. "That was a while ago, lad. Aye, true enough."</p><p>Carlus's dulled eyes glittered for a minute. "You'd have won, I wager."</p><p>"Don't be daft, boy," Raucus said, rising and giving the young Knight a squeeze on the shoulder. "Gaius Sextus is the First Lord. He would have handed me my head. And still would. Think about what happened to Kalarus Brencis, eh?"</p><p>Carlus didn't look happy to hear that answer, but he said, "Yes, my lord."</p><p>"Get some rest, soldier," Raucus said. "Well done." </p><p>At last, Raucus turned to leave the tent. There. Duty done. At last he could get a few hours of rest. The increased pressure on the Shieldwall, of late, had left him wishing that he had demanded that Crassus serve his first Legion hitch at home. Great furies knew, the boy could make himself useful now. As could Maximus. The two of them, it seemed, had at least learned to coexist without attempting to murder one another.</p><p>Raucus snorted at his own train of thought. He sounded, to himself, like an old man, tired and aching and wishing for younger shoulders to bear his burdens. Though he supposed he would rather grow old than not. </p><p>Still. It would be nice to have the help.</p><p>There were just so <i>many</i> of the crowbegotten savages. And he'd been fighting them for so bloody long.</p><p>He walked toward the stairway leading down into the fortifications within the Shieldwall itself, where a heated chamber and a cot waited for him. He'd gone perhaps ten paces when a scream of wind, the windstream of an incoming Knight Aeris, howled in the distance.</p><p>Raucus paused, and a moment later, a Knight Aeris soared in, escorted by one of the Third Aleran's Knights who had been flying patrol. Night had fallen, but the snow always made that a minor inconvenience, particularly when the moon was out. All the same, it wasn't until the man had landed that Raucus spotted the insignia of the First Antillan upon his breastplate.</p><p>The man hurried to Raucus, panting, and slammed his fist to his heart in a hasty salute. "My lord," he gasped.</p><p>Raucus returned the salute. "Report."</p><p>"Message from Captain Tyreus, my lord," the Knight panted. "His position is under heavy attack, and he urgently requests reinforcements. We've never seen so many Icemen in one place, my lord."</p><p>Raucus looked at the man for a moment and nodded. Then, without another word, he summoned his wind furies, took to the air, and headed west, toward the First Antillan's position, a hundred miles down the wall, at the best speed he could manage for the distance. </p><p>His men needed him. Rest would have to wait. </p><p>It was what one did. </p><p>****</p><p>"And I don't care how hungover you are, Hagan!" said Captain Demos, in a perfectly conversational voice that nonetheless carried the length of the ship and up and down the dock. "You get those lines coiled properly, or I'll have you scraping barnacles all the way across the Run!"</p><p>Gaius Octavian watched the surly, bleary-eyed sailor turn back to his work, this time performing more to the liking of the <i>Slive</i>'s captain.

She has been on the front lines of some of the FBIs most gripping and memorable cases, including being chosen as one of the three agents to carry out the manhunt for the Unabomber in Lincoln, Montana. She has tailed terrorists, gone undercover as a gangsters moll, and posed as the madam for a call-girl ring. Now for the first time she reveals the dangers and rewards of being a woman on the front lines of the worlds most powerful law enforcement agency. She traces the unusual career path that led her to crime fighting, and recounts the incredible obstacles she faced as a woman and as a fledgling agent. She takes readers step by step through the profiling process and shows how she helped solve a number of incredible cases. The story of her role as a lead investigator on the notorious Tylenol Murderer case is particularly compelling. Finally, she gives the true, insiders story behind the investigation that led to the arrest of the Unabomberincluding information that the media cant or wont reveal. A remarkable portrait of courage and grace under fire, Special Agent offers a missing chapter to the annals of law enforcement and a dramatic and often funny portrait of an extraordinary woman who has dedicated her heart and soul to the crusade against crime.Candice DeLongs Top Cases: 1.

An early practitioner of profiling, the analysis of crime data for what it reveals about the perpetrator, DeLong handled such ugly cases that she and her partner at one point were known as "the Gruesome Twosome." Her arrests included child molesters, rapists, and serial killers; among the book's useful features are her tips on what to do if you or your child is attacked. (Yell "Fire!" rather than "Help!" she advises; it attracts more attention.) Not that human nature's darker side was a surprise to DeLong, who came to the FBI from a job as head nurse in a maximum security psychiatric ward, where a violent paranoid schizophrenic crooned at her, "You better pray I never get out of these [restraints]. I could cut your head off. Or do you want me to tear your heart out?" The frank, conversational text ably captures the forceful personality of a female pioneer.

Only one would survive the encounter. In 1519, Hern�n Cort�s arrived on the shores of Mexico with a roughshod crew of adventurers and the intent to expand the Spanish empire. Along the way, this brash and roguish conquistador schemed to convert the native inhabitants to Catholicism and carry off a fortune in gold. That he saw nothing paradoxical in his intentions is one of the most remarkable&#x2014;and tragic&#x2014;aspects of this unforgettable story of conquest.<br><br>In Tenochtitl�n, the famed City of Dreams, Cort�s met his Aztec counterpart, Montezuma: king, divinity, ruler of fifteen million people, and commander of the most powerful military machine in the Americas. Yet in less than two years, Cort�s defeated the entire Aztec nation in one of the most astonishing military campaigns ever waged. Sometimes outnumbered in battle thousands-to-one, Cort�s repeatedly beat seemingly impossible odds. Buddy Levy meticulously researches the mix of cunning, courage, brutality, superstition, and finally disease that enabled Cort�s and his men to survive.<b><br><br>Conquistador </b>is the story of a lost kingdom&#x2014;a complex and sophisticated civilization where floating gardens, immense wealth, and reverence for art stood side by side with bloodstained temples and gruesome rites of human sacrifice. It&#x2019;s the story of Montezuma&#x2014;proud, spiritual, enigmatic, and doomed to misunderstand the stranger he thought a god. Epic in scope, as entertaining as it is enlightening,<i> Conquistador</i> is history at its most riveting.</p><p>Buddy Levy is the author of <i>American Legend: The Real-Life Adventures of David Crockett</i> and <i>Echoes on Rimrock: In Pursuit of the Chukar Partridge</i>. He is clinical associate professor of English at Washington State University, and lives in northern Idaho with his wife, Camie, and two children.<i>Chapter One<br>Setting Out for New Spain and the Serendipitous Gift of Language<br></i><br><br>Hern�n Cort�s strode to the bow of his flagship Santa Mar�a de la Concepci�n, a one-hundred-ton vessel and the largest of his armada, and scanned the horizon for land. He had much to ponder. His navigator and chief pilot, Antonio de Alaminos, an experienced veteran who had been pilot for Columbus on his final voyage, had been in these waters before&#x2014;on the Ponce de Le�n expedition in search of the fabled Fountain of Youth&#x2014;and he suggested that if they encountered foul weather, the entire fleet should make land and convene on the island of Cozumel, just east of the Yucat�n Peninsula&#x2019;s northernmost tip. Since their hurried departure from Cuba, the fleet had been buffeted by foul weather, scattering the boats. Cort�s brought up the rear, simultaneously scouring for land and for brigantines and caravels blown astray. A few, perhaps as many as five, had been lost during the night, an inauspicious beginning to such an ambitious voyage.<br><br>Cort�s had staked everything he owned on this venture&#x2014;in fact more than that, for he had incurred significant debt building the ships and stocking them with provisions. His hope to get off to a good start had been slightly compromised when his patron, the fat hidalgo Diego Vel�zquez, now governor of Cuba, attempted to thwart his departure, even after he had signed a contract officially confirming Cort�s as captain- general. Vel�zquez&#x2019;s behavior was no surprise, given the contentious nature of their relationship. On his arrival in Hispaniola (the modern-day Dominican Republic) in 1504, Cort�s had sought out the established countryman and worked under him, initially on a raid to suppress an Indian uprising on the island&#x2019;s interior, and later on an expedition captained by P�nfilo de Narv�ez to conquer Cuba, which they accomplished easily enough. After this successful venture Vel�zquez, feeling magnanimous, gifted Cort�s a large plot of land with many Indians and a number of viable, working mines on it, effectively making Cort�s rich. But the two men were both obstinate, and their relationship was soon fraught with tensions that would ultimately threaten prison, and even death, for Cort�s.<br><br>Both men shared a passion for women, and a disagreement over one Catalina Su�rez resulted in the governor&#x2019;s having Cort�s arrested and placed in the stocks. Cort�s escaped by bribing the jailor, and Vel�zquez had him arrested again, even bringing a suit upon him and threatening to hang him for his refusal to marry Su�rez, a snubbing that had sullied her reputation. Eventually Vel�zquez calmed, and the two men smoothed over their differences, but their relationship remained volatile. At present, in mid-February 1519, Vel�zquez held the political upper hand, for Cort�s sailed under his aegis, as his emissary on a mission to trade, to find gold, and to obtain more Indians to work the mines of Cuba. But the wily Cort�s had other intentions as he spotted land and had his pilot make anchor at Cozumel.<br><br>Cort�s&#x2019;s ship was the last to arrive, and on setting foot on the island he found that the local inhabitants had fled at the arrival of the first ships, dispersing into the hills and jungle. Cort�s noted their fear, filing it away as useful information. Then he was met with vexing news, and a reason for the local Indians&#x2019; behavior: one of his most trusted captains, Pedro de Alvarado, had arrived early, immediately raided the first village he encountered&#x2014;brusquely entering temples and thieving some small gold ornaments left there as prayer offerings&#x2014;and then seized a flock of about forty turkeys that were milling around the Indians&#x2019; thatch-roofed houses, even taking a few of the frightened Indians, two men and a woman, prisoner. Cort�s, incensed, contemplated how to handle the situation. He needed to trust Alvarado, and he respected the fiery redheaded countryman who also hailed from his homeland, Estremadura. Alvarado, already battle-hardened and having commanded the previous Grijalva expedition to the Yucat�n, was cocksure and felt justified in making his own independent decisions. Cort�s needed him and required a symbiotic relationship with his captains, but he also insisted that they obey his command, and he would tolerate no insubordination.1 Such behavior, he impressed upon his men, &#x201c;was no way to pacify a country.&#x201d;2<br><br>Cort�s rebuked Alvarado by commanding his men to turn over the pilfered offerings and return them to their Indian owners. He also had Alvarado&#x2019;s pilot Camacho, who had failed to obey orders to wait for Cort�s at sea, chained in irons. The turkeys had been slaughtered, and some of them already eaten, so Cort�s ordered that the fowl be paid for with green glass beads and small bells, which he gave to the prisoners as he released them, along with a Spanish shirt for each. Then Cort�s asked for a man named Melchior, a Mayan who had been taken prisoner during an earlier expedition and converted into something of an interpreter, having been taught some Spanish by his captors. Through Melchior, Cort�s spoke to the Indians as he released them and sent them back to their families, instructing them that the Spaniards came in peace and wished to do them no harm, and that Cort�s as their leader would like to meet personally with their chiefs or caciques.*<br><br>The initial diplomacy worked. The next day men, women, children, and eventually the chiefs of the villages poured forth<br><br>*Cacique is a Caribbean Arawak word for &#x201c;chief&#x201d; that the Spaniards brought with them from the islands. Many of the chroniclers, including Bernal D�az and to a lesser extent Cort�s, use the term. The word would have been unknown to mainland Mexicans.<br><br>from their hiding places in the lowland scrub and repopulated their village, which soon was bustling again. Conquistador Bernal D�az, a soldier under Alvarado&#x2019;s command who had been on both the C�rdoba and Grijalva expeditions, remarked that &#x201c;men, women, and children went about with us as if they had been friends with us all their lives.&#x201d; Cort�s sternly reiterated that the natives must not be harmed in any way. D�az was impressed by Cort�s&#x2019;s leadership and style, noting that &#x201c;here in this island our Captain began to command most energetically, and Our Lord so favored him that whatever he touched succeeded.&#x201d;3<br><br>The islanders brought food to the Spaniards, including loads of fresh fish, bundles of colorful and sweet tropical fruits, and hives of island honey, a delicacy that the island people nurtured and managed. The Spaniards traded beads, cutlery, bells, and other trinkets for food and low-grade gold ornaments. Relations seemed convivial, and Cort�s decided to hold a muster on the beach to assess the force he had amassed in Cuba.<br><br>The ships included his one-hundred-ton flagship plus three smaller vessels displacing seventy or eighty tons. The remaining boats had open or partially covered decks with makeshift canvas roofs to provide shade from the scorching sun or shelter from the rain squalls. The bigger ships transported smaller vessels that could be lowered at ports or some distance offshore, then rowed or sailed to a landing.4 The ships were packed belowdecks with ample supplies of island fare: maize, yucca, chiles, and robust quantities of salt pork which had a long shelf life, plus fodder for the stock.<br><br>The crew of mercenaries comprised chivalrous men bred on war and adventure. Over five hundred strong, these travel-hardened pikemen and swordsmen and lancers had either paid their way onto the voyage or come spurred by the promise of fortune. Cort�s strode the beach and surveyed the sharpshooters, thirty accurate crossbowmen and twelve well-trained harquebusiers bearing handheld matchlocks fired from the shoulder or chest. Ten small cannons would be fired by experienced artillery-men, who also carried light, transportable brass cannons called falconets. The detail-oriented, highly prepared Cort�s had the foresight to bring along a few blacksmiths who could repair damaged weaponry and, most important, keep the prized Spanish horses well shod. Extensive stocks of ammunition and gun- powder were packaged carefully in dry containers and guarded at all times. For land transport, Cort�s brought two hundred islanders from Cuba, mostly men for heavy portaging, but also a handful of women to prepare food and repair and fabricate the wool, flax, and linen doublets, jerkins, and brigandines the men wore.<br><br>Cort�s ordered the horses lowered from the ship&#x2019;s decks by means of strong leather harnesses, ropes, and pulleys, then had them led ashore to exercise and graze on the island&#x2019;s dense foliage. Curious islanders came forward. They had been observing the general muster, and now they were absolutely entranced by the horses&#x2014;some islanders running away in fear at the sight of them&#x2014;the first such creatures they had ever witnessed. Intrigued by the horses&#x2019; impression on the locals, Cort�s had his best cavalrymen mount the glistening and snorting animals and gallop them along the beach. Artillerymen tested cannons, firing them into the hillsides; the explosions were thunderous, flame and smoke belching from the muzzles. Archers shouldered crossbows and sent arrows whistling through the air at makeshift targets.5<br><br>When the smoke from the military display had cleared and the horses were put away, islanders approached the Spaniards more closely, and tugged at their beards and stroked the white skin of their forearms. A few of the chiefs became animated and gesticulated aggressively using sign language and pointing beyond the easternmost tip of the island. Cort�s had Melchior brought forward, and after some discussion he reported some extraordin...</p><h2>The Diplomat&#39;s Wife</h2><p><b>From the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Orphan's Tale</i></b><br><br><em>How have I been lucky enough to come here, to be alive, when so many others are not?

Her novels are inspired by her experiences working at the Pentagon and as a diplomat for the State Department handling Holocaust issues in Poland. She lives with her husband and 3 children near Philadelphia, where she teaches law.<br><br>I do not know how many hours or days I have lain on this cold, hard floor, waiting to die. For some time, it seemed certain that I already was dead, shrouded in the dark stillness of my grave, unable to move or speak.<br><br>A sharp pain shoots through my right side. It is not over. Sound comes back next in tiny waves: rats scratching inside the walls, water dripping beyond my reach. My head begins to throb against the icy concrete.<br><br>No, not dead. Not yet, but soon. I can take no more. In my mind I see the guard standing above me, an iron bar raised high above his head. My stomach twists. Did I talk? No, a voice within me replies. You said nothing. You did well. The voice is male. Alek, or Jacob perhaps. Of course, it could be neither. Alek is dead, captured and shot by the Gestapo. Jacob might be gone, too, if he and Emma did not make it across the border.<br><br>Emma. I can still see her face as she stood above me on the railway bridge. Her lips were cool on my cheek as she bent to kiss me goodbye. "God bless you, Marta." Too weak to reply, I nodded, then watched as she ran to the far end of the bridge, disappearing into the darkness.<br><br>After she was gone, I looked down at the bridge. Beneath me a dark red stain seeped into the snow, growing even as I watched. Blood, I realized. My blood. Or maybe his. The Kommandant's body lay motionless just a few meters away. His face looked peaceful, almost innocent, and for a moment I could understand how Emma might have cared for him.<br><br>But I had not; I killed him.<br><br>My side began to burn white-hot where the bullet from the Kommandant's gun had entered. In the distance, the sirens grew louder. For a moment, I regretted telling Emma to leave, rejecting her offer to help me escape. But I would have only slowed her down and we both would have been caught. This way she had a chance. Alek would have been proud of me. Jacob, too. For a moment I imagined that Jacob was standing over me, his brown hair lifted by the breeze. "Thank you," he mouthed. Then he, too, was gone.<br><br>The Gestapo came then and I lay with my eyes closed, willing death to come quickly. For a moment, when they realized that I had shot the Kommandant, it seemed certain that they would kill me right there. But then one pointed out that bullets were scarce and not to be wasted, and another that I would be wanted for questioning. So instead I was lifted from the bridge. "She'll wish we had killed her here," one said as they threw me roughly into the back of a truck.<br><br>Remembering his words now, I shiver. Most days he is right. That was some months ago. Or even years; time here blends together, endless days of loneliness, starvation and pain. The solitude is the hardest part. I have not seen another prisoner the whole time I have been here. Sometimes I lie close to the wall, thinking that I hear voices or breathing in the next cell. "Hello?" I whisper, pressing my head against the crack where the wall meets the floor. But there is never any response.<br><br>When the footsteps in the corridor do come at last, I am always filled with dread. Is it the kitchen boy, who stares at me with dark, hollow eyes as he sets down the tray of moldy bread and brown water? Or is it one of them? The torture sessions come in sudden, unpredictable bursts, none for days or weeks, then several in rapid succession. They ask the same questions over again as they beat me: Who were you working for? Who ordered you to shoot Kommandant Rich-walder? Give us the names and we'll stop, they promise. But I have not spoken and they do not stop, not until I have passed out. Once or twice they have revived me and begun again. Most times, like today, I wake up back in my cell, alone.<br><br>Yet despite everything, I have said nothing. I have done well. I smile inwardly at this. Then my satisfaction disappears. I thought, almost hoped, that this last beating would mean the end. But I am alive, and so they will surely come again. I begin to tremble. Each time is worse than the last. I cannot take any more. I must be dead before they come.<br><br>Another sharp pain shoots through my side. The Nazis operated on me shortly after I arrived at the prison, removing the bullet. At the time, I didn't understand why they would try to save me. Of course, that was before the interrogations began. The pain grows worse and I begin to sweat. Suddenly, the room grows colder and I slip from consciousness once more.<br><br>Sometime later, I awaken. The smell of my own waste hangs heavy in the air. In the distance, I hear a low, unfamiliar rumbling sound. Through my eyelids I sense light. How much time has passed? I raise my hands to my face. My right eye is sealed shut by a fresh, round welt. I rub my left eye, brushing away the thick crust that has formed in the outside corner. Blinking, I look around the cell. The room is blurry, as everything has been since they confiscated my glasses upon arrival. I can make out a pale beam of daylight that has found its way in through the tiny, lone window by the ceiling, illuminating a small puddle on the floor. My parched throat aches. If only I could make it to the water. But I am still too weak to move.<br><br>The rumbling sound stops. I hear footsteps on the floor above, then on the stairwell. The guards are coming. I close my eye again as the key turns in the lock. The cell door opens and I can hear low male voices talking. I force myself to remain still, to not tremble or give any indication that I am awake. The footsteps grow louder as they cross the room. I brace myself, waiting for the rough grasp and blows that will surely come. But the men pause in the middle of the room, still talking. They seem to be having a disagreement of some sort. They aren't speaking German, I realize suddenly. I strain to listen. "...too sick," one of the voices says. The language is not Russian or Slavic at all. English! My heart leaps.<br><br>"She must go." I open my eye quickly.Two men in dark green uniforms stand in my cell. Are they British? American? I squint, trying without success to make out the flag on their sleeves. Have we been liberated?<br><br>The shorter man has his back to me. Over his shoulder, I can see a second man, pointing toward the door. "She must go," he repeats, his voice angry. The shorter man shakes his head.<br><br>I have to get their attention. I try to sit up, but the pain is too much. I take a deep breath and cough, then raise my arm slightly. The man who had been pointing looks in my direction. "See?" he calls over his shoulder as he races toward me. The other man does not reply, but shakes his head and walks out of the cell.<br><br>The soldier kneels beside me. "Hello."<br><br>I open my mouth to respond, but only a low gurgling sound comes out. "Shh." He puts a finger to his lips. I nod slightly, feeling my cheeks redden. He reaches out to touch my arm. I jerk away. For so long, human contact has only meant pain. "It's okay," he says softly. He points to the flag on his sleeve. "American. It's okay." He reaches out again, more slowly this time, and I force myself not to flinch as he lifts my arm, pressing his large, callused fingers against my wrist. I had nearly forgotten that a person could touch so gently. He feels for my pulse, then brings his other hand to my forehead. His brow furrows. He begins to speak quickly in English, his blue eyes darting back and forth. I shake my head slightly. I do not understand. He stops mid-sentence, a faint blush appearing in his pale cheeks. "Sorry."<br><br>He pulls a metal bottle from his waistband and opens it, pouring some liquid into the cap. Then he takes one hand and places it behind my neck. I allow myself to relax against the warmth of his touch. His sleeve gives off an earthy scent that stirs a childhood memory, pine needles on the forest ground. He lifts my head slightly, cradling it as one might an infant's, bringing the cap to my lips. "Drink." I swallow the water he pours into my mouth. It has a salty, slightly metallic taste, but I do not care. I drink all that is in the first cap and a second, too.<br><br>As I drink, I study his face. He is no more than a few years older than me, twenty-three or twenty-four at most. His dark hair is very short on the sides but wavy on top. Though his expression is serious now, the crinkles at the corners of his eyes make me think he has smiled a lot. He looks kind. And handsome. I am suddenly aware of my soiled prison dress and matted curls, caked thick with dirt and blood.<br><br>I take one last sip. Then, exhausted from the effort, I go limp as he gently lowers my head to the floor. Don't, I want to say, as he slides his hand out from under my neck. His touch is familiar now, comforting. Instead I smile, trying to convey my gratitude. He nods, his eyes wide and sad. I can feel him wondering how I have come to be here, who would do this to me. He starts to stand. Panicking, I struggle to reach up and grab his hand.<br><br>"It's okay." He kneels beside me once more, gesturing toward the door of the cell with his head. "Doctor." He means to bring me help. I relax slightly, still clinging to him. "It's okay," he repeats slowly, squeezing my hand. "You will go." Go. My eyes start to burn. The nightmare is over. It is almost too much to believe. A single tear rolls hot down my cheek. He reaches out to brush it away.<br><br>He clears his throat, then touches his chest with his free hand. "Paul."<br><br>Paul. I stare up at him, repeating his name in my mind. I do not know if I can speak. But I need for him to know my name, too. I swallow, then take a deep breath. "M-Marta," I manage to say. Then, overwhelmed by the effort and all that has happened, I collapse into darkness once more.<br><br>"Awake now, are we?" A woman's voice, brisk and unfamiliar, cuts through the darkness. Have the Germans returned? I inhale sharply. Something is different. The air is no longer thick with waste, but with smells of rubbing alcohol and fresh paint. Gone are the sounds of the rats and dripping water, too. They have been replaced by gentle rustling, voices talking softly.<br><br>Snapping my eyes open, I am stunned to discover that I am no longer in my cell, but in a large room with bright yellow walls. Where am I? A woman stands by the foot of the bed. Though her face is blurry, I can see that she is wearing a white dress and cap. She comes up beside me and touches my forehead. "How are you feeling?" I swallow uncertainly. There is still pain in my side, but it is duller now, like a toothache. "My name is Dava. Do you know where you are?" She is not speaking Polish, but I understand what she is saying. Yiddish, I realize. I have not heard it since leaving the ghetto. But Yiddish is so close to German, and the woman speaks it with some sort of an accent. Perhaps this is just another Nazi trick to get me to talk. The woman, seeming to notice my distress, quickly answers her own question. "You are in a camp run by the Allies for displaced persons, just outside Salzburg."<br><br>Camp. Salzburg. My mind races. "Nazis...?" I manage to say. My throat aches as much from saying the word as from the effort of speaking.<br><br>"Gone. Hitler killed himself and what was left of the German army surrendered. The war in Europe is over." She sounds so sure, so unafraid. I relax slightly, letting her words sink in as she reaches above my head to a window and adjusts the curtains to block some of the sunlight that is streaming through. Don't, I want to say. I have lived in darkness for so long. "There, that's better." I look up at her. Though her full figure gives her a matronly appearance, I can tell by her face that she is not more than thirty. A lock of brown hair peeks out from beneath her cap.<br><br>Dava pours water from a blue pitcher into a glass on the low table beside my bed. I start to sit up, but she presses against my shoulder with her free hand. "Wait." She takes a pillow from the empty bed beside mine and, lifting me up slightly, places it atop the one already beneath my head. I notice then that I am wearing a hospital gown made of coarse, light-blue cotton. "Your body has been through a great deal. You need to move slowly." I lift my head as Dava brings the glass to my lips. "Slowly," she repeats. I take a small sip. "That's good, Marta." I look up, wondering how she knows my name. "It was written on your forehead when they brought you in," she explains. Then, noticing my surprise, she adds, "The soldiers who are liberating the camps often write things, names or conditions directly on the patients. They either don't have paper or they're afraid the information would be lost on the way in."<br><br>I take another sip, then lay my head down on the pillow once more.<br><br>Suddenly I remember the soldier helping me drink on the prison floor. "How did I get here?"<br><br>Dava replaces the glass on the table. "The Americans found you in the Nazi prison when they liberated Dachau, just outside Munich. We're just two hours south, not far from the German border, so many of the liberated are brought here. You've been unconscious since they brought you in more than a week ago. Your wound was infected and you had a very high fever. We weren't sure if you were going to pull through. But you're awake now, and the fever is gone." Dava looks over her shoulder across the room, then turns back to me. "You rest for a few minutes. I'm going to let the doctor know you're awake."<br><br>As she walks away, I lift my head again. Although my vision is blurry, I can make out two rows of narrow, evenly spaced beds running along the walls of the long, rectangular room. Mine is in the farthest corner, pressed against a wall on one side. All of the beds seem to be filled, except the one beside me. Several women dressed in white move briskly between them.<br><br>Dava returns a few minutes later carrying a tray, an older man with thick glasses in tow. He picks up my wrist with one hand and touches my forehead. Then he lifts the blanket and reaches for the corner of my gown. Surprised, I recoil.<br><br>Dava sets down the tray on the empty bed behind her and steps forward. "He just needs to examine the wound to make sure it is healing properly." I relax slightly and let the doctor lift my gown, trying not to feel his cold, unfamiliar hands as they press on my stomach. Then he pulls the gown back farther, revealing the wound. I am surprised to see fresh stitches along the incision line. "They had to operate again when you first arrived here," Dava explains. "There was a piece of bullet still inside you and you had developed an infection." I nod. In prison I often wondered why my side still ached so long after the Nazis operated on me. Now, not long after the second surgery, it already feels much better.<br><br>The doctor replaces my gown and turns to Dava, speaking to her in German too brisk and accented for me to comprehend. Then he hurries away. "He said you're healing really well. And that you should try to eat something. Are you hungry?" Before I can answer, Dava picks up a bowl from the tray behind her. "Soup," she announces brightly. I sit up slowly and this time she does not stop me, but brings the bowl close under my chin. A rich aroma wafts upward. Nausea rises in me and a cold sweats break out on my forehead. Noticing, Dava sets the bowl down on the table and picks up a cup and saucer from the tray. "Let's just start with some tea."<br><br>I sw...</p><h2>Toe-Up Socks for Every Body: Adventurous Lace, Cables, and Colorwork from Wendy Knits</h2><p>RANDOM HOUSE-Potter Craft Books: Toe-Up Socks For Every Body.

Crumb Coffee Table Art Book (Kitchen Sink Press Book for Back Bay Books)</h2><p>When published in hardcover,, The R. Crumb Coffee Table Art Book was hailed as an original &amp; audacious celebration of artistic genius &amp; American popular culture. This paperback edition makes the best of this author available in a price that fans of comic book art are sure to appreciate.</p><p>Robert Crumb, world-famous illustrator and definite pervert, got his start in the underground comics scene of the late 1960s and early 1970s. <i>The R. Crumb Coffee Table Art Book</i> is a collection of his best work from the last 50 years (it's got kids stuff, too, which is pretty fascinating). The volume is a welcome reminder that, screwed up as Crumb may be, he's also a tremendously talented, utterly original artist. He artistically embodies a certain segment of the '60s, and as that fades even further into history, Crumb's material becomes more important. Is <i>The R. Crumb Coffee Table Art Book</i> funny? Yes, certainly, in a coarse, Rabelaisian way; you'll either find it a hoot, or horribly racist and sexist. And it's not for the kiddies, obviously. But R. Crumb is so well known by now, that you probably know which group you fall into, the lovers or the haters. The lovers will find this book a wonderful treat.Robert Crumb was born in 1943 in Philadelphia. After a period drawing greeting cards, he began to work with MAD creator Harvey Kurtzman on his new humor magazine, Help! After Help! folded, Crumb heard the siren song of the Summer of Love and moved to San Francisco in 1967. He began drawing LSD-influenced comics for various underground newspapers, including The East Village Other and Yarrowstalks. In 1968, the first issue of Zap Comix was published and Crumb hawked copies from a baby carriage in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. Zap Comix was a success and attracted the attention of other artists, including S. Clay Wilson, Victor Moscoso, and Rick Griffin, all of whom joined Zap with issue 2. Crumb&#39;s comics mixed a nostalgia for comics&#39; rich history with a psychedelic exuberance. Crumb produced many more comics in the late sixties and early seventies, including Despair, Motor City, Big Ass Comics, Home Grown Funnies, People&#39;s Comix, and Your Hytone Comics, as well as the books Head Comix and Fritz the Cat. Pursued by hustling businessmen who wanted to merchandise his characters Mr. Natural and Fritz the Cat, Crumb retreated to rural California. In 1981, Crumb started Weirdo, a new anthology magazine featuring his own new work, the comics of a new generation of young cartoonists, and intriguingly strange work by certifiable &#34;outsider&#34; cartoonists. At the same time, Crumb drew several issues of a new solo comic book, Hup. In 1995, Crumb was the subject of an award-winning film biography, Crumb. Recent books and comics include Kafka, Waiting for Food, and Self-Loathing. Crumb lives in France with his wife, the artist Aline Kominsky-Crumb, and their daughter.</p><h2>Harry Potter and The Philosopher&#39;s Stone - Gryffindor Edition (Broche)</h2><p>Russian Book. Publisher: Bloomsbury. Pages: 352. Year: 2017. Cover: Paperback.</p><p>The amazing popularity of <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i> means that now even Muggles know about the Leaky Cauldron, Diagon Alley, and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Whether or not you've read about Harry, this unabridged audiobook brings his world to life. Reader Jim Dale brings an excellent range of voices to the characters, from well-meaning Hermione's soft, earnest voice to Malfoy's nasal droning; from Professor McGonagall's crisp brogue to Hagrid's broad Somerset accent; and from snarling Mr. Filch to p-p-poor, st-tuttering P-Professor Quirrel. Some of the characterizations are peculiar--why do the centaurs have Welsh accents?--but that's a small price to pay to hear one of the myriad ways to sing the Hogwarts School song. Harry Potter fans of all ages--Muggle or not--will enjoy curling up with a few chocolate frogs, a box of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans ("Alas! Ear wax!"), and this marvelous, magical audiobook.

From the surprising way he is greeted by a lovable giant, to the unique curriculum and colorful faculty at his unusual school, Harry finds himself drawn deep inside a mystical world he never knew existed and closer to his own noble destiny.</p><h2>Asterix Le Gaulois (French Edition)</h2><p>Used.

The Catholic families were Mexican, as was the majority of the population. Soon the town's Anglos, furious at this "interracial" transgression, formed a vigilante squad that kidnapped the children and nearly lynched the nuns and the local priest. The Catholic Church sued to get its wards back, but all the courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, ruled in favor of the vigilantes. <p></p><p> <i>The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction</i> tells this disturbing and dramatic tale to illuminate the creation of racial boundaries along the Mexican border. Clifton/Morenci, Arizona, was a "wild West" boomtown, where the mines and smelters pulled in thousands of Mexican immigrant workers. Racial walls hardened as the mines became big business and whiteness became a marker of superiority. These already volatile race and class relations produced passions that erupted in the "orphan incident." To the Anglos of Clifton/Morenci, placing a white child with a Mexican family was tantamount to child abuse, and they saw their kidnapping as a rescue. </p><p> Women initiated both sides of this confrontation. Mexican women agreed to take in these orphans, both serving their church and asserting a maternal prerogative; Anglo women believed they had to "save" the orphans, and they organized a vigilante squad to do it. In retelling this nearly forgotten piece of American history, Linda Gordon brilliantly recreates and dissects the tangled intersection of family and racial values, in a gripping story that resonates with today's conflicts over the "best interests of the child." </p></p><p><b>Linda Gordon</b> is Professor of History at New York University. She is the author of the now classic history of birth control in <i>America, Woman's Body, Woman's Right</i>, and of <i>Heroes of Their Own Lives: The Politics and History of Family Violence</i>, winner of the Joan Kelly Prize for the best book in women's history.In her gripping book, <i>The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction</i>, Linda Gordon has written a model study of the creation and maintenance of race relations that manages to capture both the breathless sensationalism of the era's tabloids and the complexity of social status, shifting racial codes and the multiple uses of sex roles in social action...Gordon divides her story into six scenes, most of them devoted to some portion of the four days when the orphans' arrival engulfed Clifton-Morenci in a near riot followed by a mass kidnapping. Spliced between each scene is the history--long-term and proximate--of the towns' sociocultural landscape. It is an ingenious narrative device that enables her to reconstitute the distinct social structures of the area while rendering a taut journalistic account of the unfolding drama...The magnificence of her achievement [is] her masterly assembly of historical detail and acute sensitivity to the intricacies of human relations as mediated by power, prejudice and the passing of time. (Stephen Lassonde <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>If Gordon's book did nothing more than redeem from obscurity the story of the Arizona orphans, it would be an extraordinary contribution to social history. But Gordon has gone beyond that scanty written record, mainly from the court proceedings, to explore the motives of the Mexican and Anglo women...Gordon's achievement is that she so effectively and fair-mindedly delved into the site and unearthed this appalling and poignant story. (Michael Kenney <i>Boston Globe</i>)<br><br>This is an unusual and interesting work of history, whose chief strength lies in the way it lovingly recreates the spirit of a particular Arizona community and, through its insistence on micro-historical detail, gives the reader a clear sense of how racial assumptions and antagonisms operated within everyday life. (Paul Giles <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>A story of racism, vigilantism, and injustice that retains its grim fascination after nearly a century...The sordid but suspenseful story is told against a background that encompasses the mining industry, labor unions and even a waffling U.S. Supreme Court. (<i>Parade Magazine</i>)<br><br>Gordon's extraordinary achievement in this book lies in her narrative strategy as much as in her insights as a social historian: she alternates dramatic short chapters detailing the events in the mining communities of Clifton-Morenci from the first to the fourth of October 1904 with longer, denser ones that reconstruct the conflation of class, gender, racial, religious, and economic interests that initiated the children's journey west from New York City and underlay their distribution by Father Mandin, the local priest. (Gay Wachman <i>Women's Review of Books</i>)<br><br>Linda Gordon has used [the orphan abduction's] events to explore issues of race, gender, class, economics and theories of the family in a beautifully constructed narrative and analysis of a flashpoint in American domestic history...Gordon uses her multiplicity of sources with great skill, all the time reminding us that some participants in the story have left no record of their experiences, particularly the children's birth mothers, the children themselves, and the Mexican families with whom they were to be placed. She contextualises the event superbly, giving us a well-rounded portrait of Clifton-Morenci at the time, as well as taking us through the ideological and emotional processes which moved people to act as they did. (Catriona Crowe <i>Irish Times</i>)<br><br>Historian Linda Gordon has unearthed a small, forgotten story, and told it exceptionally well...[The] astonishing story, less than a century old, contains much to ponder. Gordon does a masterful job probing class and race, gender and religion, family and border economics to shed light on conflicts unresolved to this day...She has crafted both an exhilarating yarn and a sober morality tale. (Karen R. Long <i>Plain Dealer</i>)<br><br>[A] fascinating, almost cinematic book...Gordon has brilliantly retrieved history, in the process providing a vivid, complex addition to the growing scholarship on 'whiteness.' (JoAnn Wypijewski <i>Lingua Franca Book Review</i>)<br><br>It is both fascinating and disturbing to delve into specific events of American history: Cultural biases explode, exploitation simmers, and religious identity is challenged. Linda Gordon's book confronts all these issues...Delving deeper and deeper into the American conscience, Gordon shatters layer upon layer of assumption. She has done her research, and the story she has written breathes life as a dragon breathes fire, burning sometimes accidentally, though oftentimes intentionally. As a challenge to preconceived notions of American history, as a reflection of cultural, religious and economic realities and as a how-to guide for retrieving important historical lessons, <i>The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction</i> is fascinating, repelling and completely engrossing. (Ian Graham <i>The Star-Ledger</i>)<br><br>In 1904, a group of New York nuns delivered 40 mostly Irish but entirely Catholic orphans to a remote Arizona mining town to be adopted by local Catholics. What happened next is the subject of historian Linda Gordon's compelling new book: For their act of Christian charity, the nuns were rewarded with near-lynching and public vilification of an intensity hard to fathom today. As Gordon makes clear in writing so alive it makes the reader smell sagebrush and white supremacy, the Eastern nuns didn't realize that, in turn-of-the-century Arizona, Catholic also meant Mexican, and Mexican meant inferior.

Her earlier works include Postmortemthe only novel to win five major crime awards in a single yearand Cruel and Unusual, which won Britains prestigious Gold Dagger Award for the best crime novel of 1993. Dr. Kay Scarpetta herself won the 1999 Sherlock Award for the best detective created by an American author.Kay Scarpetta, renowned criminal investigator with the National Forensic Academy in Florida, hunts another serial murderer. Basil Jenrette, imprisoned serial killer and research subject, is somehow connected. Kate Reading's narration is good; she is particularly adept at depicting the therapist's calm, controlled voice, then switching to the anger and belligerence of Moreno, former city cop. Scarpetta fans may be disappointed that her focus in this novel is forensics of the dysfunctional , rather than murder and investigative work, and that the story's ending is illogical. Some parts of the story are overly gruesome, as well. Even excellent narration and characterization can't salvage this poorly plotted mystery. One expects better from Cornwell.

He is a member of the Latino Literary Hall of FameIn May 2001, 26 Mexican men scrambled across the border and into an area of the Arizona desert known as the Devil's Highway. Only 12 made it safely across. American Book Award�&#x20ac;"winning writer and poet Urrea (<i>Across the Wire</i>; <i>Six Kinds of Sky</i>; etc.), who was born in Tijuana and now lives outside Chicago, tracks the paths those men took from their home state of Veracruz all the way <i>norte</i>. Their enemies were many: the U.S. Border Patrol ("La Migra"); gung-ho gringo vigilantes bent on taking the law into their own hands; the Mexican Federales; rattlesnakes; severe hypothermia and the remorseless sun, a "110 degree nightmare" that dried their bodies and pounded their brains. In artful yet uncomplicated prose, Urrea captivatingly tells how a dozen men squeezed by to safety, and how 14 others�&#x20ac;"whom the media labeled the Yuma 14�&#x20ac;"did not. But while many point to the group's smugglers (known as coyotes) as the prime villains of the tragedy, Urrea unloads on, in the words of one Mexican consul, "the politics of stupidity that rules both sides of the border." Mexican and U.S. border policy is backward, Urrea finds, and it does little to stem the flow of immigrants. Since the policy results in Mexicans making the crossing in increasingly forbidding areas, it contributes to the conditions that kill those who attempt it. Confident and full of righteous rage, Urrea's story is a well-crafted mélange of first-person testimony, geographic history, cultural and economic analysis, poetry and an indictment of immigration policy. It may not directly influence the forces behind the U.S.'s southern border travesties, but it does give names and identities to the faceless and maligned "wetbacks" and "pollos," and highlights the brutality and unsustainable nature of the many walls separating the two countries.

A. Henty)</h2><p>Mr. Henty weaves into the record of Josephus an admirable and attractive story. The troubles in the district of Tiberias, the march of the legions, the sieges of Jotapata, of Gamala, and of Jerusalem, form the impressive and carefully studied historic setting to the figure of the lad who passes from the vineyard to the service of Josephus, becomes the leader of a guerrilla band of patriots, fights bravely for the Temple, and after a brief term of slavery at Alexandria, returns to his Galilean home with the favor of Titus.---11 illustrations with map/plan of the siege of Jerusalem</p><p>A stirring tale of the last days of the Temple at Jerusalem. Robber bands and political infighting sets the stage for the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70. In the face of overwhelming odds, John of Gamala does his best to save God&#39;s Temple, harrasing Roman work parties, burning Roman camps, defending Jerusalem during the Roman siege, and even fighting Titus himself in hand-to-hand combat--forging a relationship with the Roman leader that lasts until after the war. In spite of fighting a losing battle, John keeps his integrity and honor intact.Young people across America are rediscovering G. A. Henty, the 19th century literary genius whose historical adventures inspire boys to honesty, courage, diligence, and duty. Writing from a Christian perspective, Henty weaves the adventures of a fictional boy hero together with real-life events. His stories are as accurate as they are exciting, so children get important lessons in history which they remember long afterward. Just as important, these lessons come without the immoral overtones of modern novels. <p><i>For the Temple</i> descends into the turmoil that ended with the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus in A.D. 70. John, a 15-yearold Glilean, fears that the Jewish revolt against Rome could bring disaster upon his people--and the Temple. Then, his bravery in a storm attracts the attention of the governor, Josephus. Suddenly, he finds himself in the forefront of events. After escaping from the massacre at Jotapata in A.D. 67, John, with his loyal band, becomes a hero to the Jews and a scourge to the Romans. He disrupts Roman work parties. . .showers arrows and boulders onto troops. . .burns Roman camps. . .rescues his betrothed from slavery. . .even fights Titus himself in hand-to-hand combat: </p><p>"John's knife fell from his hand. He tried to rise to his feet; then everything seemed to swim round, and he fell insensible. Titus rose to his feet; he was shaken by the fall, and he, too, had lost much blood. Panting from his exertions, he looked down upon his prostrate foe, and the generosity which was the prevailing feature of his character, except when excited in battle, mastered him. 'By Hercules,' he exclaimed, 'that is a gallant youth, though he is a Jew, and he has well-nigh made an end of me! What will Vespasian say when he hears that I have been beaten in a fair fight and owe my life to the mercy of a Jew!'" </p><p>In the final defense of the Temple, John is delivered yet again, only to be enslaved. But his slavery leads him to Caesar's court and finally home, not just to Glilee, but to that Galilean preacher his father had recognized as a prophet forty years before. </p><p>BONUS!

Leaving the reek of the battlefield, he rode his blood-flecked white charger down to the very edge of the Red Sea. Behind him, he knew, Christian outliers would already be advancing against his palace--to seize his treasury, to capture his queen. Certainly, his conquerors had no cause to show him mercy. Few were more notorious among the Christians than Yusuf. Two years previously, looking to secure the south-west of Arabia for his own faith, he had captured their regional stronghold of Najran. What had happened next was a matter of shock and horror to Christians far beyond the limits of Himyar, the kingdom on the Red Sea that Yusuf had ruled, on and off, for just under a decade. The local church, with the bishop and a great multitude of his followers locked inside, had been put to the torch. A group of virgins, hurrying to join them, had hurled themselves on to the flames, crying defiantly as they did so how sweet it was to breathe in "the scent of burning priests!"1 Another woman, "whose face no one had ever seen outside the door of her house and who had never walked during the day in the city,"2 had torn off her headscarf, the better to reproach the king. Yusuf, in his fury, had ordered her daughter and granddaughter killed before her, their blood poured down her throat, and then her own head to be sent flying.<br><br>Martyrdoms such as these, feted though they were by the Church, could not readily be forgiven. A great army, crossing from the Christian kingdom of Ethiopia, had duly landed in Himyar. The defenders had been cornered, engaged and routed. Now, with the shallows of the Red Sea lapping at his horse's hooves, Yusuf had come to the end of the road. Not all his obedience to the laws granted to God's chosen prophet had been sufficient to save him from ruin. Slowly, he urged his horse forwards, breasting the water, until at last, weighed down by his armour, he disappeared beneath the waves. So perished Yusuf As'ar Yath'ar: the last Jewish king ever to rule in Arabia.<br>The collapse of the kingdom of the Himyarites in ad 525 is not, it is fair to say, one of the more celebrated episodes of ancient history. Himyar itself, despite having prospered for some six centuries until its final overthrow under Yusuf, lacks the ready brand recognition today of a Babylon, or an Athens, or a Rome. Unsurprisingly so, perhaps: for southern Arabia, then as now, was firmly peripheral to the major centres of civilisation. Even the Arabs themselves, whom the peoples of more settled lands tended to dismiss as notorious brutes--"of all the nations of the earth, the most despised and insignificant"3--might look askance at the presumed barbarities of the region. The Himyarites, so one Arab poet reported in shocked tones, left their women uncircumcised, "and do not think it disgusting to eat locusts."4 Behaviour that clearly branded them as beyond the pale.<br><br>Yet, it is not only in terms of its geography that Himyar seems to lie in shadow. Similarly obscure is the period in which the death of Yusuf occurred. The sixth century ad defies precise categorisation. It seems to stand between two ages. If it looks back to the world of classical civilisation, then so also does it look forward to the world of the Crusades. Historians categorise it, and the centuries either side of it, as "late antiquity": a phrase that conveys a sense of lengthening shadows, and the Middle Ages soon to come.<br><br>For anyone accustomed to thinking of history as a succession of neatly defined and self-enclosed epochs, there is something vaguely unsettling about this. Rather like the scientist in the classic horror film The Fly, who ends up a mutant combination of human and insect, the world of late antiquity can seem, from our own perspective, peculiarly hybrid. Far beyond the borders of Yusuf's Himyarite kingdom, empires raised on fabulously ancient foundations still dominated the Near East and the Mediterranean, as they had done for centuries. Yet, their very age served only to highlight how profoundly they were coming to slip the moorings of their past. Take, for instance, the region immediately to the north of Arabia: the land we know today as Iraq. Here, across mudflats that had witnessed the dawn of urban civilisation, loyalty was owed to a king who was, just as his predecessor had been a whole millennium previously, a Persian. His dominions, like those of the Persian Empire that had existed a thousand years before, stretched eastwards to the frontiers of India, and deep into Central Asia. The splendours of the court over which he presided, the magnificence of its rituals, and the immodesty of his pretensions: all would have been perfectly familiar to a king of Babylon. That this was so, however, had been almost forgotten by the people of Iraq themselves. A spreading amnesia was blotting out memories that had endured for millennia. Even the Persians, far from venerating the truth about their glorious imperial heritage, had begun to obscure and distort it. The legacy of Iraq's incomparable history lived on--preserved in the Persians' fantasies of global rule and in the many glories that lent such fantasies credence--but increasingly it wore the look, not of ages departed, but of something new.<br><br>Other superpowers were less neglectful of their pasts. The great cities of the Mediterranean, built of stone and marble rather than the mud-bricks favoured by the people of Iraq, were less prone to crumbling into dust. The empire that ruled them likewise wore, in 525, a veneer of venerable indestructibility. Even to the Persians, Roman might appeared something primordial. "God so arranged things," they would occasionally acknowledge, albeit through gritted teeth, "that the whole world was lit up from the beginning by two eyes: namely, by the wise rulers of the Persian realm, and by the powerful empire of the Romans."5 Nevertheless, the Romans themselves, although certainly never averse to flattery, knew better. Rather than believing that their empire had existed since the dawn of time, they knew perfectly well that all its greatness had evolved from nothing. To trace the course of that evolution might therefore be to fathom the secrets of its success. Even as Yusuf was vanishing into the Red Sea, plans were being laid in the Roman capital for an immense ransacking of libraries and archives, an unprecedented labour of scholarship whose goal was the preservation for all eternity of the empire's vast inheritance of laws. This was no arid, merely antiquarian project. History, no less than armies or gold, had come to function as one of the sinews of the Roman state. It offered the empire reassurance that it was precisely what it claimed to be: the model of human order. How, then, was the prestige of Caesar to be maintained, if not by a perpetual trumpeting of Rome's triumphant antiquity?<br><br>The challenge for Roman policy-makers, of course, was that the glories of the past did not necessarily provide them with a reliable guide for the future. Indisputably, the empire remained what it had been for almost a millennium: the most formidable superpower of all. Wealthier and more populous than its great Persian rival, its hold over the eastern Mediterranean, always the richer half, appeared secure. From the mountains of the Balkans to the deserts of Egypt, Caesar ruled them all. Nevertheless, it was clearly an embarrassment, to put it mildly, that what had once been the western half of Rome's empire had ceased, by 525, to be Roman at all. Over the course of the previous century, an immense swath of her holdings, like a sandcastle battered by the waves of an incoming tide, had crumbled utterly away. Britain had been lost as early as 410. Other provinces, over the succeeding decades, had followed. By the end of the century, the entire western half of the empire, even Italy, even Rome itself, had gone. In place of the venerable imperial order there was now a patchwork of independent kingdoms, all of them--with the exception of a few in western Britain--ruled by warrior elites from beyond the limits of the former empire. The relationship that existed between the natives and these "barbarian" newcomers varied from realm to realm: some, like the Britons, fought the invaders tooth and nail; others, like the Italians, were given to hailing them as though they were Caesars. Yet, in every case, the empire's collapse resulted in the forging of new identities, new values, new presumptions. These, over the long term, would lead to the establishment of a radically new political order in western Europe. Rome's abandoned provinces would never again acknowledge a single master.<br><br>Time would see both the great empires of the age--the Persian as well as the Roman--go the way of Nineveh and Tyre. Not so the states established in Rome's western provinces, some of which still commemorate in their modern names the intrusions back in late antiquity of barbarian war bands. Small wonder, then, that European historians have traditionally seen the arrival of the Franks in the land that would eventually become France, and of the Angles in the future England, as events of far greater long-term significance than the activities of any Caesar or Persian king. We know now, as their contemporaries did not, that ruin was stalking both the rival empires. A century on from the collapse of the Himyarite kingdom, and the two superpowers were staring into the abyss. That the Persian Empire would end up toppled completely while that of the Romans was left as little more than a mangled trunk, has traditionally served to mark them as dead-ends, bed-blockers, dinosaurs. How tempting it is to presume, then, that they must have perished of decrepitude and old age. The lateness of late antiquity, to those who trace in it only a calamitous arc of decline and fall, has the quality of dinner guests who refuse to get their coats once the party is over.<br><br>Except that the empires raised by the peoples of the age wer...</p><h2>The Eagle and the Raven</h2><p>Recounts the period in Texas history when renegade Sam Houston emigrated to the Mexican state of Tejas and helped lead the 1836 revolution against Mexican president Santa Anna</p><p>"The Raven" is Sam Houston, insolent frontiersman, brash congressman, Tennessee governor, rural schoolmaster, lawyer, land speculator in the Mexican state of Tejas (later Texas).

In 400 B.C. the Greek physician Hippocrates noted that eating cheese after a meal could cause indigestion and discomfort, especially if accompanied by wine. Apparently Europeans were already enjoying that habit if they didn&#x2019;t suffer reflux. Heartburn, also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), can have serious consequences and should not be ignored. Drugs that doctors prescribe for the condition can be very difficult to discontinue, however, and have potential side effects. We&#x2019;re not convinced that they are always better than home remedies.<br> &nbsp;<br> Baking Soda<br> Q: I used to have very bad heartburn until I remembered a home remedy my mother used to make. I mix a couple ounces of water, an ounce of apple cider vinegar, and a teaspoon of sugar. After the sugar dissolves, I add half a teaspoon of baking soda, stir it briefly, and drink the mixture immediately. This offers fast relief.<br> A: Baking soda is a time-honored approach to neutralizing stomach acid that has splashed into the esophagus and is causing heartburn.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yellow Mustard<br> Q: My wife and I both use plain old yellow mustard to combat indigestion or acid reflux. It works very well for us. If we swallow a spoonful of mustard before an Italian meal, we are okay.<br> A: Although mustard may seem like the last thing anyone would want to take for heartburn, we have heard from others that it can be helpful. The turmeric that makes mustard yellow was traditionally used for digestive upset in Chinese medicine. Mustard also contains vinegar, which some people find helpful against heartburn.<br> &nbsp;<br> Papaya<br> Q: I frequently have heartburn and finally found a wonderful remedy: papaya pills. Every time I have heartburn, I eat one of the pills and the heartburn disappears. My doctor says it&#x2019;s fine to use them. Others might like to know about this great way to treat heartburn.<br> A: Papaya is a tropical fruit that contains an enzyme (papain) that may be very helpful for digestion. Although papain does nothing to suppress acid, some people report that papaya relieves heartburn. Anyone who is allergic to latex should avoid papaya since there is cross-reactivity between latex and papaya, which could be very dangerous.

During World War I, Chandler served in France with the First Division of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, transferring later to the Royal Flying Corps (R. A. F.). In 1919 he returned to the United States, settling in California, where he eventually became director of a number of independent oil companies. The Depression put an end to his career, and in 1933, at the age of forty-five, he turned to writing fiction, publishing his first stories in <i>Black Mask</i>. Chandler&#x2019;s detective stories often starred the brash but honorable Philip Marlowe (introduced in 1939 in his first novel,<b> The Big Sleep</b>) and were noted for their literate presentation and dead-on critical eye. Never a prolific writer, Chandler published only one collection of stories and seven novels in his lifetime. Some of Chandler&#x2019;s novels, like <b>The Big Sleep</b>, were made into classic movies which helped define the film noir style. In the last year of his life he was elected president of the Mystery Writers of America. He died in La Jolla, California on March 26, 1959.</p><h2>Someone to Care: Viola&#39;s Story (The Westcott Series)</h2><p><b><b>**Instant New York Times Bestseller</b>**<br><br>Once the Countess of Riverdale, Viola Kingsley throws all caution to the wind when adventure calls in the form of a handsome aristocrat. . . .</b><br><br>Two years after the death of the Earl of Riverdale, his family has overcome the shame of being stripped of their titles and fortune--except for his onetime countess, Viola. With her children grown and herself no longer part of the social whirl of the ton, she is uncertain where to look for happiness--until quite by accident her path crosses once again with that of the Marquess of Dorchester, Marcel Lamarr. <br><br>Marcel Lamarr has been a notorious womanizer since the death of his wife nearly twenty years earlier. Viola caught his eye when she herself was a young mother, but she evaded his seduction at the time. A prize that eluded him before, she is all the more irresistible to him now although he is surprised to discover that she is as eager now for the excitement he offers as he is himself.<br><br>When the two defy convention and run away together, they discover that the ties of respectability are not so easily severed, and pleasure can ensnare you when you least expect it. . . .</p><p><b>Mary Balogh </b>grew up in Wales and now lives with her husband, Robert, in Saskatchewan, Canada. She has written more than one hundred historical novels and novellas, more than thirty of which have been <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers. They include the Bedwyn saga, the Simply quartet, the Huxtable quintet, the seven-part Survivors' Club series, and, most recently, the Westcott series, including <i>Someone to Wed</i>, <i>Someone to Hold</i>, and <i>Someone to Love</i>.The hired carriage in which Viola Kingsley had been traveling just a short while before the Marquess of Dorchester spoke to her at the country inn not only had been uncomfortable with its hard seats and surely nonexistent springs and its drafty windows and door and its innumerable squeaks and groans and pervading smell of oldness and staleness. It had also developed a severe limp and was proceeding at less than half its former speed and was listing somewhat to one side. Try as she would to sit upright, she had kept finding her left shoulder pressed up against the hard wood panel beside the seat. At any moment she had expected that the carriage would stop altogether and she would be stranded in the middle of nowhere.<br><br> And it was all her fault. She would have no one to blame but herself.<br><br> Two years before, something truly catastrophic had happened to Viola. She had been Viola Westcott, Countess of Riverdale, at the time and had recently suffered the loss of the earl, her husband of twenty-three years. Her son, Harry, had succeeded to the title. He had been only twenty years old at the time and had therefore been placed under the guardianship of Avery Archer, Duke of Netherby, and of Viola herself. Her elder daughter, Camille, had already made her debut into society and was respectably betrothed to Viscount Uxbury. Her younger daughter, Abigail, was looking forward to her own come-out Season the following spring. Viola had been satisfied with her life despite the necessity of wearing deep mourning. She had not been fond of her husband and felt no great grief at his passing.<br><br> There had been just one loose end to be tied up, and she had made an attempt to tie it. There was a girl, a young woman by then, whom her husband had kept and secretly supported&#x2014;he had thought it was a secret, anyway&#x2014;at an orphanage in Bath for as long as Viola had known him. She had made the understandable assumption that the female was his natural daughter by a mistress, and had done what she had considered the right thing after his death by sending her solicitor to Bath to find the woman, inform her of her father&#x2019;s death, and make a final settlement upon her.<br> That was when the catastrophe had hit.<br><br> For it had been discovered that the young woman concerned, Anna Snow, then twenty-five years old and a teacher at the orphanage, was in fact the late earl&#x2019;s legitimate daughter by a previous wife. By his only wife as it happened. He had married Viola a few months before Anna Snow&#x2019;s mother died of consumption. Viola&#x2019;s marriage had been a bigamous one. Worse, her son and her daughters were illegitimate. Harry was stripped of his title and fortune&#x2014;the title had passed to his second cousin, Alexander Westcott, and the fortune to Anna. All of it. The earl had made only one will, and that had been drawn up while he was still with his first wife. Everything that was not entailed went to his daughter by that marriage. Camille and Abigail lost their titles and their portions. Camille was cast off by Lord Uxbury. Abigail would have no come-out Season or any prospect of making the sort of marriage she had been brought up to expect. They had been left destitute, though Anna had tried to insist that her fortune be divided equally among her half siblings and herself. But at the time, she was a stranger to them. In their pride and hurt and bewilderment they had all refused. Viola had resumed her maiden name.<br><br> To say that the bottom had fallen out of her world would be severely to understate the case. The enormity of what had happened to her and her children had been too much for her mind to bear. She had lived on. How could she not, short of putting an end to her own existence? And in the two years since then her life had settled into a new order that was really more bearable than she could have expected. Harry was serving as a captain with a rifle regiment in the Peninsula and was forever cheerful in his insistence that it was just the life for him. Camille was married to a much better man than her former betrothed and they had three children&#x2014;two adopted and one their own. Abigail lived with Viola at Hinsford Manor in Hampshire, where Viola had spent most of her marriage. What had truly been unexpected after the whole mess was that Anna Snow would end up marrying Harry&#x2019;s guardian, Avery, Duke of Netherby. But she had, and was a duchess now herself. She had insisted she would never live at Hinsford Manor herself and had begged Viola not to let it sit empty. She had even written into her will that the house would pass to Harry and his descendants after her time if he would not accept it before then. The large dowry Viola&#x2019;s father had given when she married Humphrey had been returned, with all the interest it would have accrued since then. Anna had insisted upon it and taken care of it even before Viola could think of it for herself.<br><br> Meanwhile, the rest of the Westcott family, far from shunning Viola and her children after the truth became known, had made every effort to draw them back into the fold. As one, they had made it clear to Viola and her children that they were no less loved and valued now than they ever had been, and no less a part of the family. Two of Viola&#x2019;s sisters-in-law, the earl&#x2019;s sisters, were still fond of saying that they dearly wished Humphrey were still alive so that they could have the pleasure of killing him themselves.<br><br> All was well, in fact. Or as well as it would ever be after a few necessary adjustments had been made. Viola, who had lived her whole adult life according to the two guiding principles of duty and dignity, appeared to be back to normal, albeit with a different name. She had convinced herself that she was back to normal, anyway.<br><br> Until she was not.<br><br> Until she snapped&#x2014;unexpectedly and for no apparent reason. The trauma of what she had experienced had stealthily crept up behind her and then pounced. And she knew that she had not healed at all. She had only suppressed the pain and the hurt. And the anger.<br> She had snapped at the worst possible time, when the family had all gathered in Bath for the christening of Jacob Cunningham, Camille and Joel&#x2019;s newborn son. They had all agreed to stay on afterward for two weeks of family activities. But two days after the event, Viola, the baby&#x2019;s own proud grandmother, had fled.<br><br> She had left Bath feeling guilty and out of sorts and sorry for herself and hurt and angry and all sorts of other nasty, negative things that had no rational explanation. She had simply behaved badly, and that was something she rarely did. Through all her forty-two years she had been known for her graciousness of manner and the evenness of her temper. Yet now she had hurt and bewildered those who were dearest to her in the world. And she had done it deliberately, almost spitefully. She had insisted upon returning home to Hinsford against all reason and against the pleadings of her daughters and son-in-law and the protests of her mother and brother and the Westcott family.&nbsp;<br><br> She had announced her intention of returning home. Alone. In a hired carriage. She had pointedly insisted upon leaving her own carriage and servants, even her personal maid, for the use of Abigail when she should decide to return home. She had ignored the shocked protestations of Camille and Joel that they would of course see Abby properly conveyed and escorted home when the time came. She had ignored the kindness of the Dowager Countess of Riverdale, her former mother-in-law, who had come all the way to Bath, though she was in her seventies. She had ignored the kind effort Wren, the present countess, Alexander&#x2019;s wife, had made to come to Bath despite the fact that she was herself in expectation of a happy event, as Matilda, the eldest of Viola&#x2019;s former sisters-in-law, liked to describe pregnancy.<br><br> Viola had told them all to mind their own business. Yes, she had used those exact words. She had probably never in her life used them before. And she had spoken sharply, without humor or consideration for the feelings she was hurting. She wanted to be left alone. She had told them that too.<br><br> Leave me alone, she had said more than once&#x2014;like a petulant child.<br><br> And she had no idea why she had so suddenly snapped.<br><br> She had gone to Bath with Abigail just before Jacob&#x2019;s birth, brimful of anxiety and excitement at the imminent arrival of a new grandchild, and she had been happier when it had happened than she had been in a long while. Camille and Joel Cunningham lived in a manor in the hills above Bath with Winifred and Sarah, their adopted daughters, and now with their son too. They used the house for a variety of purposes&#x2014;for artistic or writing retreats, for workshops in music and dance and painting and other arts, for plays and concerts, and for visits varying from one day long to several days of the children from the orphanage in Bath where both Anna and Joel had grown up and Camille had taught briefly before her marriage. The house and extensive garden were always teeming with life and activity. Even just before and after Jacob&#x2019;s birth it had remained a busy, noisy place.<br><br> The amazing thing was that Camille appeared to be thriving. She had not yet lost all the weight she had gained when she was expecting Jacob, and she often looked slightly untidy, some of her hair fallen out of its pins, her sleeves pushed halfway to her elbows, her feet as often as not unshod, even when she stepped outdoors. She always seemed to have Jacob bundled up in her arms while Sarah clung to her skirt and Winifred hovered close&#x2014;except when Joel was around to share the parenting, as he often was. She never seemed harried.<br><br> Sometimes it was hard for Viola to recognize in her elder daughter the severe, straitlaced, always rigidly correct former Lady Camille Westcott, who had never set a foot wrong and had lacked any discernible sense of humor. Now she seemed vividly happy in a life that was as different from the one she had expected as it could possibly be.<br><br> Everything had gone well with the birth and the plans for the christening and the event itself. Abigail had been ecstatic, for her dearest friend came too for the occasion&#x2014;her cousin Jessica Archer, daughter of one of Humphrey&#x2019;s sisters. Viola had been happy. She had developed a close friendship with Alexander&#x2019;s wife, Wren, the year before, and she was delighted to renew it this year. She was happy that her brother and his wife had come from Dorset. Dinners, parties, teas, excursions, walks, concerts&#x2014;any number of family events had been planned. Viola had been looking forward to them.<br><br> Until she snapped.<br><br> And had to get away.<br><br> Alone.<br><br> She had behaved badly. She knew it. She had left at dawn before the family on both sides could gather to hug her and say their farewells and express their concern and wave her on her way. And she had held steady on her determination to travel by hired carriage, though she had had the offer of half a dozen private carriages and servants to go with them to give her company and protection and respectability.<br><br> Leave me alone, she had said to more than one of them.<br><br> But then suddenly there was something wrong with the hired carriage. And finally it had been creaking and moaning more than ever and leaning ever harder to one side as it turned into the yard of an inn, though surely not a major posting inn. The carriage had ground to a halt.<br><br> &#x201c;What is amiss?&#x201d; she had asked the coachman when he opened the door and set down the steps.<br> The carriage had hovered over them at an alarming angle.<br><br> &#x201c;Axle about to bust, missus,&#x201d; he had said.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; She had accepted his hand and climbed down to the cobbles of the yard. &#x201c;Can it be mended quickly?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not likely, missus,&#x201d; he had said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s going to need to be replaced, she is.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How long?&#x201d; she had asked.<br><br> He had lifted his hat to scratch his head as he went down on his haunches to assess the damage. An ostler belonging to the inn had come ambling up to stand at his shoulder and purse his lips and shake his head. &#x201c;You was lucky,&#x201d; he had said, &#x201c;not to be tipped on the open road miles from anywhere for highwaymen and wolves to find you. You might have got yourselves killed if you&#x2019;d been springing &#x2019;em. That there axle ain&#x2019;t going to be held together with no piece of string tied around it, I&#x2019;m here to tell you. It&#x2019;s got to go and a new one put in its place.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Which is exactly what I can see for myself,&#x201d; the coachman had said testily.<br><br> &#x201c;How long will that take?&#x201d; Viola had asked again, realizing anew how foolish she had been to go against all advice by venturing on her journey without even a maid to lend her countenance. Oh, she deserved this.<br><br> The coachman had shaken his head. &#x201c;I dunno, missus. All the rest of today, anyway,&#x201d; he had said. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t get back on the road till tomorrow morning at the earliest, and a blessed unlucky thing it is for me. I was to go straight back to Bath tonight, I was. I have another customer booked for tomorrow, and a right classy gent he is too, a regular. Always pays a lot more than the fare if I gets him where he&#x2019;s going with time to spare. Now someone else will get to take him and he may never ask for me again.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Tomorrow?&#x201d; Viola had said in dismay. &#x201c;But I need to be home today.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, so do I, missus,&#x201d; the coachman had said. &#x201c;But neither one of us gets to have our wish, do we? You had better speak to the innkeeper here for a room for yourself before they all gets taken, though I doubt that happens too often in this place.&#x201d; He had looked up at the inn with some contempt.<br><br> A smart traveling carriage had been standing to one side of the inn door. It must not be an entirely decrepit place, then. The thought of entering it unaccompanied, however, had caused Viola to quail inside. Whatever would they think of her lone state? But she had caught herself in the thought. Good heavens, she was thinking like the Countess of Riverdale, for whom all had had to be rigid respectability. What did it matter what anyone thought of plain Viola Kingsley? She had reached into the carriage to pull out the bag she had kept inside with her and made her way toward the inn, leaving her trunk to be fetched later.<br><br> Noise had greeted her as she opened the door, as well as the odors of ale and cooking. The double doors into the taproom to her left had been wide open, and she had seen that the room, dark and shabby though it appeared, was filled with people, all of whom had seemed to be in high spirits&#x2014;perhaps in more ways than one. It was surprising for so early in the day. But all had been clarified when the innkeeper came to tend to her and explained that if she had to be stranded by a near-bust axle, for which he expressed his sincere sympathies, at least she was fortunate that it was here and today that it had happened. The village was about to celebrate the end of the harvest, though they did not do it every year. But the church roof was leaking something bad whenever it rained, and that always seemed to happen on a Sunday morning when people were sitting in their pews trying to listen to the vicar&#x2019;s sermon. Someone had had the idea of organizing an after-the-harvest event to raise money.

It is the beginning of an infatuation that will last a lifetime.

On the Paris paddle-steamer which transports him to his home town of Nogent-sur-Seine at the outset of the novel, he becomes transfixed by the demure Madame Arnoux and, back in Paris, cultivates her ebullient and enterprising husband in order to be near her. Frederic&#39;s devotion fluctuates like his other enthusiasms, and he is caught up in the intense pleasures and the inevitable ennuis of Parisian life.<b>Gustave Flaubert</b>&nbsp;was born in Rouen in 1821, the son of a prominent physician. A solitary child, he was attracted to literature at an early age, and after his recovery from a nervous breakdown suffered while a law student, he turned his total energies to writing. Aside from journeys to the Near East, Greece, Italy, and North Africa, and a stormy liaison with the poetess Louise Colet, his life was dedicated to the practice of his art. The form of his work was marked by intense aesthetic scrupulousness and passionate pursuit of le mot juste; its content alternately reflected scorn for French bourgeois society and a romantic taste for exotic historical subject matter. The success of&nbsp;Madame Bovary&nbsp;(1857) was ensured by government prosecution for &#x201c;immorality&#x201d;;&nbsp;Salammb�&nbsp;(1862) and&nbsp;The Sentimental Education&nbsp;(1869) received a cool public reception; not until the publication of&nbsp;Three Tales&nbsp;(1877) was his genius popularly acknowledged. Among fellow writers, however, his reputation was supreme. His circle of friends included Turgenev and the Goncourt brothers, while the young Guy de Maupassant underwent an arduous literary apprenticeship under his direction. Increasing personal isolation and financial insecurity troubled his last years.

She's been shot at, spat at, cussed at, fire-bombed, mooned, and attacked by dogs. Time for a change, Stephanie thinks. Time to find the kind of job her mother can tell her friends about without making the sign of the cross. </p><p>So Stephanie Plum quits. Resigns. No looking back. No changing her mind. She wants something safe and normal. As it turns out, jobs that are safe and normal for most people aren't necessarily safe and normal for Stephanie Plum. Trouble follows her, and the kind of trouble she had at the bail bonds office can't compare to the kind of trouble she finds herself facing now. Her past has come back to haunt her. She's stalked by a maniac returned from the grave for the sole purpose of putting her into a burial plot of her own. He's killed before, and he'll kill again if given the chance. Caught between staying far away from the bounty hunter business and staying alive, Stephanie reexamines her life and the possibility that being a bounty hunter is the solution rather than the problem. After disturbingly brief careers at the button factory, Kan Klean Dry Cleaners, and Cluck-in-a-Bucket, Stephanie takes an office position in security, working for Ranger, the sexiest, baddest bounty hunter and businessman on two continents. It might not be the job she'll keep for the rest of her life, but for now it gives her the technical access she needs to find her stalker. Tempers and temperatures rise as competition ratchets up between the two men in her life---her on-again, off-again boyfriend, tough Trenton cop Joe Morelli, and her bad-ass boss, Ranger.

Can you?</p><p>Between the adventure and the adversity there's attitude, and Stephanie Plum's got plenty in her newest misadventure from Janet Evanovich, <i>Eleven on Top</i>.</p></p><p>Stephanie Plum, Trenton's favorite bondswoman, is having a career crisis, which gives Janet Evanovich plenty of opportunities to showcase her series heroine in a variety of alternative vocations, from dry cleaner to factory worker. Most of them don't last a full working day, which is good for the reader, since it plunges Stephanie back into the always seedy, often dangerous, and always colorful world of fugitives who'd rather flee than face their day in court. She may be tired of having her life threatened, her cars torched or blown up, and her apartment broken into, but one thing she can say about her job is that it's never boring... and neither is she. Despite her intentions of going straight at a job with a little more security and a bit less excitement, an old client won't let her--he keeps leaving her threatening notes, stalking and scaring her, and making sure she needs the protection of the two men in her life--Joe Morelli, the sexy cop who's been bedding her since high school, and Ranger, the even sexier tough guy who can take down the meanest fugitive around but has a tender spot in his heart for the plucky Ms. Plum. All Evanovich fans' favorite characters people this sprightly caper novel, including Lula, the fast-food-chomping former hooker who's hot to take over Stephanie's job but really belongs in a WWE Takedown; Grandma Mazur, who'd rather go to a wake than a fancy-dress ball; Grandma Bella, the matriarch of the Morelli family whose evil eye frightens even the indomitable Stephanie; and Valerie, Stephanie's sister, who's about to embark on another trip to the altar. A great beach read, <i>Eleven on Top</i> is a guilty pleasure that will delight readers of the author's 10 earlier novels and should win her even more fans. <i>--Jane Adams</i> <p> <b>Amazon.com Exclusive Content</b> </p><p> <br><b>Amazon.com's Significant Seven</b><br> <i>Janet Evanovich kindly agreed to take the life quiz we like to give to all our authors: the Amazon.com Significant Seven.</i><br><br></p><p> <b>Q:</b> What book has had the most significant impact on your life?<br> <b>A:</b> Uncle Scrooge adventures by Carl Barks.

She allowed the Bible to speak for itself with the details she presented, neither adding nor subtracting from it.&#x201d; &#x2013; Michele P from Family, Faith, and Fridays &#x201c;Fast paced, Biblically and historically accurate, great fun!&#x201d; &#x2013; Hal &amp; Melanie Young, authors of Raising Real Men, 2011 CSPA Book of the Year Know what&#x2019;s even better? Hope is a recent homeschool graduate herself &#x2013; and so is the illustrator, Mike Slaton! She actually came up with the idea when her family was studying ancient Egypt. Inspire your own children to write!</p><p>Hope Auer has been writing stories and plays actively since she was very young. Through her schooling years she developed a passion for history and telling stories which eventually culminated in the writing of The Promised Land Series. In addition to writing, Hope loves the Lord, life, church, family, and children. She was homeschooled and works and learns alongside her family, who are the first people to read her books. Hope has a heart for children that is evident as she helps in youth theatre, teaches piano, and writes stories. Hope also has a little Shih Tzu named Sophie who often sits on her lap and helps her write.Hope Auer's book, A Cry From Egypt, succeeds on multiple levels. There are shining examples of young people wrestling with doubts and trying to understand what God is doing. There are delightful examples of healthy families, under difficult circumstances, doing what families do caring for each other, teasing each other, loving each other. There is romance - young people thinking about marriage and seeking wise counsel facing the eternal struggles of the course of true love. As a historian, I particularly admired her portrayal of ancient Egypt in the time of Moses. We pass too lightly through the list of the ten plagues. We know how the story ends. For those who lived it, it must have been terrifying. They had no idea what would come next, or how the story would end. Miss Auer has done an admirable job of showing us the impact that the dramatic events of the Exodus must have had on ordinary families in Egypt. A Cry From Egypt is a great read for young adults from upper middle to high school (and adults could profit by reading it too!) ---Rob Shearer, Publisher, Greenleaf Press<br><br>Miss Fashionista is now in 8th grade, and she is reading at grade level, but she is not one of those given to curling up with a good book and staying up into the wee hours to finish Just. One. More. Chapter. <p> Until now. </p><p> Hope Auer is a young writer who has been creating stories for many years already. She is the author of A Cry From Egypt, the historical fiction story of a young Hebrew slave in Egypt prior to the Exodus. Each chapter is filled with drama and suspense woven around the dangers and trials of those who witnessed the ten plagues that fell upon Pharaoh and his people. </p><p> One night before bed, I asked Miss Fashionista to check it out for me before we started reading it aloud together later in the week. Turns out, she couldn t put it down until she finished it. I woke up to the note outside her bedroom door the next morning. When she did get up the next day, the first thing she said to me was Mom! You have to buy the next book! Order it now! Unfortunately, I had to tell her that it wasn t quite written yet that part at the end of the book was just a sample of the next book Hope is working on. This first book in The Promised Land series is still in pre-production mode itself. </p><p> I have worked as a writing teacher and editor for for my entire adult life. I have read more stories from young authors than I can count, but Hope s work is the first to make me think of JRR Tolkien, CS Lewis, and Frank Perretti when I read it. The action flows so well, it is hard to put it down. The characters and their mannerisms are genuine and entirely believable. They are so fully developed that even adults will enjoy it. Miss Fashionista loved the main character s courage and her family s willingness to risk their own lives for each other. But it s not all happy circumstance. At times, we couldn t turn the pages fast enough to find out what would happen next. At other times, we were reaching for a tissue along the way. Miss Auer has a talent for drawing in a reader s emotions and enabling us to to experience the story as all the great works of fiction do. </p><p> I could go on and on about the book, but I don t want to ruin it for anyone. You and your family just have to read it. You will love it! Whether you are studying ancient history this year or not, you won t want to miss this book. It is a great read for all ages. ---Patsy Brekke, Writing Foundations</p></p><h2>Overcoming Depression One Step at a Time: The New Behavioral Activation Approach to Getting Your Life Back</h2><p><p>What if depression weren&#x2019;t a disorder occurring on its own but was rather a kind of signpost pointing at tangible things you needed to change in your life?

It is not unusual for him to pick up a map, drive to an area that intrigues him, and then start walking. It should come as no surprise then that a detour from U.S. 66 to visit the Grand Canyon on a June morning in 1963 inspired Fletcher to walk the length of the Canyon below the rim. In <i>The Man Who Walked Through Time</i> Fletcher recounts his amazing journey. For two months Fletcher struggled against heat and cold, lack of water and dwindling supplies. The terrain was, at times, nearly impassible, yet despite the physical hardships, Fletcher came away from his experience with a new awareness of how humans fit into the vast scheme of things. He writes, for example, of meeting a rattlesnake on Beaver Sand Bar: "Now I am no rattlesnake <i>aficionado</i>. The first rattler I met scared me purple, and killing it seemed a human duty.... Yet by the end of that California summer I no longer felt an unreasoning fear of rattlers.... Instead, I accepted them as organisms with a niche in the web of life. Accepted them, that is, as fellow creatures."<p> <i>The Man Who Walked Through Time</i> is a remarkable account of a journey both physical and spiritual. It is also a record of the Grand Canyon as it was before the massive influx of tourism. Fletcher's descriptions of the spectacular geography, the wildlife, and the remnants of much older cultures serve to remind us that the Grand Canyon has been around longer than humankind and may well outlast us.</p>7 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Sex Lives of Cannibals: Adrift in the Equatorial Pacific</h2><p>At the age of twenty-six, Maarten Troost&#x2014;who had been pushing the snooze button on the alarm clock of life by racking up useless graduate degrees and muddling through a series of temp jobs&#x2014;decided to pack up his flip-flops and move to Tarawa, a remote South Pacific island in the Republic of Kiribati.

In <i>The Generals</i>, Thomas E. Ricks sets out to explain why that is. In chronicling the widening gulf between performance and accountability among the top brass of the U.S. military, Ricks tells the stories of great leaders and suspect ones, generals who rose to the occasion and generals who failed themselves and their soldiers. In Ricks&#x2019;s hands, this story resounds with larger meaning: about the transmission of values, about strategic thinking, and about the difference between an organization that learns and one that fails.</p><p><b>Thomas E. Ricks </b>is an adviser on national security at the New America Foundation, where he participates in its "Future of War" project. He was previously a fellow at the Center for a New American Security and is a contributing editor of&nbsp;<i>Foreign Policy</i>magazine, for which he writes the prizewinning blog The Best Defense. A member of two Pulitzer Prize-winning teams, he covered U.S. military activities in Somalia, Haiti, Korea, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Kuwait, Turkey, Afghanistan, and Iraq. He is the author of several books, including&nbsp;<i>The Generals</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Gamble</i>, and the number one&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestseller&nbsp;<i>Fiasco</i>, which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.

Stark, fact-based, and strongly argued."&nbsp;<b><i>&#x2014;Chicago Tribune</i></b><br><br> "Ricks shines, blending an impressive level of research with expert storytelling."&nbsp;<b><i>&#x2014;The Weekly Standard</i></b><br><br> "[A] savvy study of leadership. Combining lucid historical analysis, acid-etched portraits of generals from 'troublesome blowhard' Douglas MacArthur to 'two-time loser' Tommy Franks, and shrewd postmortems of military failures and pointless slaughters such as My Lai, the author demonstrates how everything from strategic doctrine to personnel policies create a mediocre, rigid, morally derelict army leadership... Ricks presents an incisive, hard-hitting corrective to unthinking veneration of American military prowess."&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;<i>Publisher's Weekly </i>(Starred Review)</b><br><br> "Informed readers, especially military buffs, will appreciate this provocative, blistering critique of a system where accountability appears to have gone missing - like the author's 2006 bestseller, <i>Fiasco</i>, this book is bound to cause heartburn in the Pentagon." <b>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus</i></b><br><br> "Entertaining, provocative and important." <b><i>&#x2014;The Wilson Quarterly</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;This is a brilliant book&#x2014;deeply researched, very well-written and outspoken. Ricks pulls no punches in naming names as he cites serious failures of leadership, even as we were winning World War II, and failures that led to serious problems in later wars.&nbsp; And he calls for rethinking the concept of generalship in the Army of the future.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;William J. Perry, 19th U.S. Secretary of Defense</b><br><br> &#x201c;Thomas E. Ricks has written a definitive and comprehensive story of American generalship from the battlefields of World War II to the recent war in Iraq. <i>The Generals</i> candidly reveals their triumphs and failures, and offers a prognosis of what can be done to ensure success by our future leaders in the volatile world of the twenty-first century.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Carlo D&#x2019;Este, author of <i>Patton: A Genius for War</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Tom Ricks has written another provocative and superbly researched book that addresses a critical issue, generalship. After each period of conflict in our history, the quality and performance of our senior military leaders comes under serious scrutiny. <i>The Generals</i> will be a definitive and controversial work that will spark the debate, once again, regarding how we make and choose our top military leaders.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Anthony C. Zinni, General USMC (Ret.)</b><br><br> &#x201c;<i>The Generals</i> is insightful, well written and thought-provoking. Using General George C. Marshall as the gold standard, it is replete with examples of good and bad generalship in the postwar years. Too often a bureaucratic culture in those years failed to connect performance with consequences. This gave rise to many mediocre and poor senior leaders. Seldom have any of them ever been held accountable for their failures. This book justifiably calls for a return to the strict, demanding and successful Marshall prescription for generalship. It is a reminder that the lives of soldiers are more important than the careers of officers&#x2014;and that winning wars is more important than either.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Bernard E. Trainor, Lt. Gen. USMC (Ret.); author of <i>The Generals&#x2019; War</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;<i>The Generals</i> rips up the definition of professionalism in which the US Army has clothed itself.

Used in Russian healing therapies since the time of Peter the Great, shungite contains almost the entire periodic table of the elements as well as fullerenes, the hollow carbon-based molecules that recent research shows are able to slow both the growth of cancer cells and the development of the AIDS virus. <br> <br>Citing many double-blind scientific and medical studies on shungite, Regina Martino explains its many protective, healing, and detoxifying properties, including its ability to counteract the harmful effects of electromagnetic fields and radiation from computers, cell phones, Wi-Fi, and other electronic devices and appliances. Acting as a natural antioxidant, immune booster, pain reliever, and allergen suppressant, shungite and &#x201c;shungite water&#x201d; can be used to treat skin ailments and musculoskeletal diseases, accelerate the healing of cuts and wounds, cleanse internal systems, and increase the body&#x2019;s intake of vital energy. Detailing shungite&#x2019;s many microelements and biologically active substances, Martino reveals how the stones have been proven to purify and revitalize water. Exploring the energetic properties of shungite, she reveals how it facilitates energetic transfers between the chakras and higher energies outside the body and can be used to harmonize living spaces. <br> <br>Truly a marvel of the natural world, shungite offers protection against the perils of our modern technological world and healing for both body and spirit.</p><p>Regina Martino is a geobiologist and bioenergy expert specializing in stones and crystals. She lives in Paris, France, where she runs La Roche M�re, a crystal, gem, and stone boutique.<b>CHAPTER 7 <br>BIOENERGETIC RESEARCH ON SHUNGITE</b> <br> <br>What is the unique property that distinguishes shungite from other protection stones? <br> <br>I have carried out detailed studies using bioenergetic tests and have personally tested more than 200 stones and crystals that have an influence on the chakras. Among those tested, I made comparative studies of about 20 stones, including shungite, that were able to resonate with the first chakra. <br> <br>In comparing tests on shungite with tests carried out on other stones of this group, we noticed right away that for stones of the same weight, shungite is the stone that achieves the largest expansion of the vital field, the greatest concentration, and, in a striking way, a significant expansion of the first chakra. <br> <br>It is quite possible that the presence of fullerenes would explain all of shungite&#x2019;s qualities: <br> <br>1. Helping the energetic body correct the influence of left-torsion fields <br>2. Neutralizing the impact of electromagnetic radiation <br>3. Opening access to life energy (first chakra) <br>4. Concentrating the vital field <br>5. Not taking on negative charges <br> <br><b>CORRECTING THE INFLUENCE OF LEFT-TORSION FIELDS</b> <br> <br>At every moment, our energetic body is continuously informed and influenced by everything around it. It picks up and integrates subtle information from everything that it comes into contact with, whether or not we&#x2019;re aware of it. <br> <br>A torsion field, created by the form of an object or by the spin of elementary particles as defined in quantum physics, can have a right rotation (as in DNA) or a left rotation. Research conducted by Russian scientist Vlail Kaznacheyev at the Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine at Novosibirsk has demonstrated that right rotation fosters life, whereas a torsion field that has left rotation has a negative effect on cells. Pulsed wave radiation such as Wi-Fi and DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications) generate left-torsion fields. <br> <br>The influence of left-torsion fields shifts our vertical axis and totally unbalances our bioenergetic system. Our system tries to rebalance itself, but if the influence is present for long periods it can permanently upset the energetic system and disturb it to the point where it influences the physical plane, giving rise to dysfunction and illness. <br> <br>When shungite is in direct contact with the physical body or when it is present as a nearby emanation (see the action of spheres or pyramids of shungite in the chapter &#x201c;Practical Applications&#x201d;), it helps the energetic body <i>instantaneously</i> correct the shifting of the plane to the left and allows the system as a whole to remain centered. It also allows the individual to be connected to telluric energy and cosmic energy in a natural and positive way. <br> <br>This property of shungite is its main asset. This is what makes it a stone of protection as well as a stone that accompanies the healing of a number of illnesses. <br> <br><b>NEUTRALIZING THE IMPACT OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION</b> <br> <br>Another of shungite&#x2019;s great assets, which mainly accounts for its recent fame, is its ability to protect us from electromagnetic radiation. This radiation is one of the principal sources of left-torsion fields. <br> <br>The rapid technological development of our society has brought us into contact all day long with a large quantity of sources of harmful radiation, and very often we are quite unaware this is happening. It is clear that we need to find solutions so that humankind can survive its own technology. <br> <br>Over the past fifteen years, a number of researchers in the field of bioenergy have endeavored to establish systems that would allow individuals to reestablish their equilibrium. However, it has only been recently that the public at large is beginning to be more fully informed about the health problems created by the increase in electromagnetic radiation. A simple, efficient, inexpensive solution is what we need: shungite. <br> <br>Our research on shungite demonstrated its effectiveness in neutralizing the effects of electric fields, electromagnetic fields, and pulsed electromagnetic fields such as those emitted by home appliances, cordless phones, cell phones, Wi-Fi hot spots, computers--in short, all of the electromagnetic emissions that generally surround us. <br> <br>We conducted two kinds of experiments: one was to test the different ways the impact of electromagnetic fields on the individual could be corrected and the other was to try to correct the harmful information directly at its source. In both cases we obtained satisfying results with shungite. We provide a complete account of these tests in appendix 1. <br> <br>The transformative effect of shungite appears essentially at the bioenergetic level: we could say that it transforms left-torsion information into right-torsion information. Although electromagnetic waves are invisible, they have a physical component, and it is this physical component that is picked up by electromagnetic field detectors. When information is modified on a subtler energetic level, the physical information is still picked up by the detection equipment. In other words, shungite does not interfere with the functioning of this equipment. It doesn&#x2019;t turn off the pulsed waves emitted by a Wi-Fi transmitter, a cordless phone, or a cell phone; it transforms the harmful radiation. <br> <br>The solution is not to eliminate the radiation but instead to prevent its deleterious impact on our health. <br> <br>We&#x2019;re going to illustrate this especially important property of shungite with an example drawn from an experiment carried out recently in Russia. Researchers went to a site where fowl were being raised and for twenty-one days they studied three incubators, each of which contained ninety-eight hen&#x2019;s eggs. They placed a cell phone in standby mode in the center of the first incubator. The second incubator had another cell phone in standby mode, positioned on a shungite plate. The third incubator was the control and was used in the normal way. At the end of twenty-one days, the control group had a loss rate of 11.2 percent. The incubator with an unprotected cell phone had twenty-one chicks hatch--a rate of loss of 79.42 percent! The incubator with the cell phone that had shungite protection came in with a rate of loss of 10.5 percent. The figures speak for themselves!</p><h2>The Frozen Shoulder Workbook: Trigger Point Therapy for Overcoming Pain and Regaining Range of Motion</h2><p>Powerful Techniques to Relieve Shoulder Pain and Stiffness <p> Author Clair Davies' own case of frozen shoulder led him to undertake an extensive study of trigger points and referred pain that eventually resulted in his best-selling Trigger Point Therapy Workbook. Now this renowned bodywork expert and educator revisits the subject of frozen shoulder with <strong>The Frozen Shoulder Workbook</strong>, offering the most detailed and comprehensive manual available for this painful and debilitating condition, a useful resource for self-care-with and without a partner-and for bodywork practitioners looking to expand their treatment repertoire.</p> <p> Frozen shoulder, the syndrome name for several joint and tendon-related symptoms, is experienced as a loss of motion and pain in the shoulder and upper arm. It is most often observed in women between the ages of forty and sixty and individuals with type-two diabetes. Unlike traditional medical treatments for the condition, which rely on painkillers, steroid injections, and physical therapy and often do little to moderate symptoms or speed recovery, trigger point therapy can bring real and lasting relief. This gentle massage technique targets localized areas of tenderness in soft tissue. Put it to work for you to relieve pain, restore range of motion, and shorten recovery times.</p> <p> &nbsp;</p></p><p>From the renowned author of the best-selling <b>Trigger Point Therapy Workbook</b> comes this first-ever book of self-care techniques for frozen shoulder, a very common painful and mobility-restricting condition.<p>If you&#x2019;re enduring the misery of a frozen shoulder, you need to know that "adhesive capsulitis" is almost always a mistaken diagnosis. Unless your shoulder has been "frozen" for several months or years, adhesions haven&#x2019;t had time to form. Unfortunately, most of what you hear from the medical establishment and find on the internet is outdated, parroted dogma about adhesive capsulitis.</p> <p>Your shoulder pain and stiffness is almost certainly caused by myofascial trigger points (tiny contraction knots) in muscles associated with the shoulder. Trigger points are easily treated, and good results usually come very quickly. These are medically proven facts, although very few medical schools teach them as yet, and most doctors are still out of the loop.</p> <p>Even so, thousands of massage therapists, physical therapists, and a growing number of physicians have studied trigger point therapy independently and are using it to successfully treat shoulder pain and frozen shoulder.</p> <p>Don&#x2019;t let inertia, lack of knowledge, or someone else&#x2019;s uninformed skepticism keep you from doing your own research. Try the therapy yourself and find out for yourself whether it works. Trigger point massage is such a simple therapy that most people are able to treat themselves.</p> <p>Don&#x2019;t buy the myth that you have to endure this misery for a year or longer. (I cured my own frozen shoulder in four weeks.) If you have the initiative to assimilate and apply the information contained in The Frozen Shoulder Workbook, there&#x2019;s a good chance you can cure your own frozen shoulder too.</p></p><h2>Emergence</h2><p>A true story that is both uniquely moving and exceptionally inspiring, Emergence is the first-hand account of a courageous autistic woman who beat the odds and cured herself. As a child, Temple Grandin was forced to leave her &#34;normal&#34; school and enroll in a school for autistic children. This searingly honest account captures the isolation and fears suffered by autistics and their families and the quiet strength of one woman who insisted on a miracle.</p><p>Temple Grandin is one of the world&#39;s foremost experts in the design and construction of livestock handling facilities. Her projects can be found throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, England, and Denmark. She holds an M.S. from Arizona State in animal science and received her Ph.D. in 1988 from the University of Illinois at Urbana. She now is a professor at the University of Colorado in Denver.This book is written by a woman who overcame a severe disability to become a successful designer of livestock equipment. Though professionals have been theorizing about it for years, the phenomenon called autism has re mained shrouded in mystery. The au thor makes a few dents in this mys tique, giving us insights which are rare because autism by its nature generally precludes such expression and analysis of emotion. She combines a personal perspective with relevant research in formation in assessing how autism can be overcome and even, in some ways, turned to personal advantage. This ac count will be significant reading for any professional or lay person interested in autism, and is also a moving story of the human hidden behind a distorting facade.

Galvin describes the seasons, the weather, the wildlife, and the few people who do not possess but are themselves possessed by this terrain. In so doing he reveals an experience that is part of our heritage and mythology. For Lyle, Ray, Clara, and App, the struggle to survive on an independent family ranch is a series of blameless failures and unacclaimed successes that illuminate the Western character. <i>The Meadow</i> evokes a sense of place that can be achieved only by someone who knows it intimately.</p></p><p><p>Raised in northern Colorado, <b>James Galvin</b> is the author of three volumes of poetry and a novel, <i>Fencing the Sky</i>. He has received the Nation/Discovery Award as well as fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Institutes. Mr. Galvin divides his time between Iowa City, where he teaches at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop, and his ranch near Tie Siding, Wyoming.</p>A passionate hundred-year history of a small mountain ranch on the Colorado-Wyoming border. Galvin (Writing/Univ. of Iowa) was raised and still lives for part of each year in Tie Siding, Wyoming. Here, he tells of the lives of his neighbors and of the successive owners of a ranch consisting in the main of a 360-acre hay meadow. Galvin's annals are comprised of one hundred very brief vignettes, remarkable for their sympathetic portrayals of these men and women and their Antaeus-like symbiosis with the beautiful but unforgiving land. Cutting back and forth in time, the author tells of Appleton (``App'') Worster, who homesteaded the meadow in 1895, raising three boys but losing two wives and finally the farm itself in 1938. App was buried on a ridge where his sons had to use drills and dynamite to dig his grave. Galvin also writes of App's son Ray, who, while logging at age 12 with his brothers and father, saw a man fishing and was struck dumb by astonishment--it was the first time Ray had ever seen someone he didn't know. And then there's the meadow's present owner, Lyle, slowly drowning in emphysema and condemned to sitting by himself and gazing at the log buildings he made by hand and at the meadow where he cut timothy grass for 40 years. Galvin's montage engages through its multiple views, but just as often it perplexes: The funeral of a man is described, but then the man reappears and dies only later in the book; and the relationships between some of the principal characters prove a formidable puzzle, at least at first. Still, Galvin's progressive deepening and widening of his story, and his comely prose, more than compensate.

As television, video games, and the Internet threaten to distract young people from the solitary pleasures of reading, Bloom presents a volume that will amuse, challenge, and beguile readers with its myriad voices and subjects. <br> Here are old favorites by beloved writers of children's literature, as well as exciting rediscoveries and wonderful works penned by writers better known for their adult classics, such as Herman Melville, Leo Tolstoy, Edith Wharton, and Walt Whitman. Encompassing the natural world and the supernatural; childhood, romance, and death; pets, wild animals, and goblins; mystery, adventure, and humor; the selections reflect the passion and erudition of our most revered literary critic. Arranged by season, <i>Stories and Poems for Extremely Intelligent Children of All Ages</i> is a must-have anthology, sure to delight readers young and old for years to come.</p><p>Apart from the Extremely Pompous title, and the heavy bent toward masculine authors, this collection of classics by the likes of Tolstoy, Edith Wharton, O. Henry, and Lewis Carroll is vastly impressive. And editor Harold Bloom does, of course, explain his title in the introduction. He believes that all the included authors "make themselves open to authentic readers of any age." Despising most "commercially offered" contemporary children's literature, Bloom offers up the greats: Edward Lear's "The Owl and the Pussy-Cat," Shakespeare's "The Lion in Winter," Hans Christian Andersen's "The Red Shoes," and dozens upon dozens more, organized on a seasonal scheme. Here, readers of all ages can learn, grow, be entertained, reflect. Bloom quotes poet Wallace Stevens in his test for verse or prose: "it must change, it must give pleasure, and it must be abstract." Every one of these masterpieces of varying lengths is worthy of reading, rereading, and reading aloud--Extremely Intelligent Children of All Ages would be wise to look beyond the title and devour this 573-page anthology, cover to cover.<p> Bloom is the author of more than 20 other books, including another tome on the art of reading, <i>How to Read and Why</i>.

But as Teddy unearths more information that just doesn't seem to connect, his straightforward mission becomes far bigger--and stranger--than he could imagine. The trail of breadcrumbs leads to secrets hidden within secrets, evildoers trading in money and power, and a global threat on an unprecedented scale.

He pulled himself out and sat on the deck, drinking in the morning sun.</p><p>His broken leg had nearly healed. Remarkable, considering the amount of stress he'd subjected it to before allowing it to be put in a cast. Or rather, put back in a cast. Extenuating circumstances had forced him to cut off the original cast in order to deal with a life-or-death situation. He'd been a good boy since, even followed his rehab regimen.</p><p>The fact that he liked swimming didn't hurt.</p><p>He got up, sat in a deck chair, and poured himself a cool glass of lemonade.</p><p>Teddy enjoyed the three-story split-level Hollywood house on Mullholland Drive that he'd purchased in the name of Billy Barnett. Teddy had three identities. That is . . . three current identities. In the course of his career, he had played many roles, occasionally more than one at a time, but they were usually temporary. As Billy Barnett, he had risen through the ranks from production assistant to producer at Centurion Studios. As Mark Weldon, he was a stuntman who had evolved into a character actor who specialized in playing villains.</p><p>As Teddy Fay, he was not known at all.</p><p>His cell phone rang. Teddy scooped it up. "Hello?"</p><p>"Billy Barnett?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"This is Lance Cabot."</p><p>Teddy nearly dropped the phone. Lance Cabot was the head of the CIA. Teddy had worked for Lance once, before going rogue and killing people who deserved to die. Lance had organized a global manhunt for him, but Teddy was so elusive they soon elevated him to the top of the Most Wanted list. When even a presidential pardon failed to cool the Agency's ardor, Teddy changed his name and dropped out of sight. He'd been rumored dead. Most agents subscribed to the rumor.</p><p>Teddy said, "Why would the head of the CIA be calling a Hollywood film producer?"</p><p>"I'm not calling you in your producer capacity."</p><p>Teddy paused. "Go on."</p><p>"We have a problem in Paris."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"We have a mole. Which is ridiculous-there's nothing happening in Paris that would warrant an enemy power planting a mole at that branch. The Agency was tracking only one individual recently, a low-level Syrian agent named Hassan Hamui. Recently he suddenly dropped out of sight, as if he knew he was under surveillance: knew when, how, and by whom. That's why we think we have a mole."</p><p>"And you want someone to handle the situation? Well, I'm not the man you're looking for. I happen to know you went out of your way to try to kill him, so I'd hardly care to be that guy. But if you want me to apply my meager talents to the situation, perhaps we can work something out."</p><p>"You want money?"</p><p>"Hardly. I can't be bought because I have all I need. I'm not above doing a favor for a friend, but you hardly fit into that category."</p><p>"You're still alive, aren't you?"</p><p>"What do you mean by that?"</p><p>"If I wanted to, finding and killing you wouldn't be hard. After all, I made this phone call."</p><p>"Is that a threat?"</p><p>"Not at all. I'm pointing it out as a token of friendship, since such things seem to matter."</p><p>"What would I have to do?"</p><p>"Go undercover, assume a new identity. I know you've played everybody from a bag lady to a bank president, but this might be sort of a stretch."</p><p>"Oh? Who do I have to pretend to be?"</p><p>"A CIA operative."</p><p>"Thanks a heap."</p><p>"I need you to leave at once."</p><p>"Are you picking me up here?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Will you fly me from New York?"</p><p>"It shouldn't look like we brought you in. Our mole would go on high alert. It has to appear as if you're emerging from deep cover. Whoever you wish to be will suddenly appear in our records as if he'd been there all the time. You get to pick your own legend. Once you do, you might let me know who you are."</p><p>"You're saying no one's running me. There's no one in charge of this mission I can contact."</p><p>"Would you listen to them if there were?"</p><p>"What's my cover story?"</p><p>"It doesn't matter, just so you have one. We have a leak. We don't know how high or low it goes, but we can't be telling people who might be the leak that we're looking for the leak."</p><p>"I have to create my own cover, fly myself in, and make up my own assignment?"</p><p>"I thought you'd like that."</p><p>"Fuck you, too, Lance."</p></p><h2>The Other America: Poverty in the United States</h2><p>In the fifty years since it was published, <i>The Other America </i>has been established as a seminal work of sociology. This anniversary edition includes Michael Harrington&#x2019;s essays on poverty in the 1970s and &#x2019;80s as well as a new introduction by Harrington&#x2019;s biographer, Maurice Isserman. This illuminating, profoundly moving classic is still all too relevant for today&#x2019;s America.<br><br>When Michael Harrington&#x2019;s masterpiece, <i>The Other America</i>, was first published in 1962, it was hailed as an explosive work and became a galvanizing force for the war on poverty. Harrington shed light on the lives of the poor&#x2014;from farm to city&#x2014;and the social forces that relegated them to their difficult situations. He was determined to make poverty in the United States visible and his observations and analyses have had a profound effect on our country, radically changing how we view the poor and the policies we employ to help them.</p><p>Born in Missouri in 1928, Michael Harrington was a writer, political activist, theorist, professor, commentator, and founding member of the Democratic Socialists of America. During his time as editor for <i>New America</i>, he wrote his seminal text <i>The Other America: Poverty in the United States</i>, a bestseller that has been credited for sparking the War on Poverty. A frequent writer, Harrington wrote fifteen books and has had articles publishes in journals such as <i>The New Republic, The Nation, </i>and many others. He married in 1963 and had two children.

Her goal was modest: to make a living by offering comfortable lodging and Southern home cooking served family style in the downstairs dining room. <br><br>Mrs. Wilkes' reputation was strong and business was brisk from the beginning, but it was the coverage in <i>Esquire</i> and the <i>New York Times,</i> and even a profile on David Brinkley's evening news that brought Southern-food lovers from all over the world to her doorstep. <br><br>With over 300 recipes, photos from the boardinghouse, and culinary historian John T. Edge's colorful telling of Mrs. Wilkes' contribution to Savannah and Southern cuisine, this rich volume is a tribute to a way of cooking&#x2014;and eating&#x2014;that must not be forgotten. <br><br><b>Recipient of <i>Southern Living's</i> Reader's Choice Award 2000</b><br><b>Winner of the 1999 James Beard &#x201c;America's Regional Classics&#x201d; Award</b><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>SEMA WILKES was born in 1907 to Georgia farmers who grew tobacco, cured hams, smoked sausages, and otherwise worked hard to get by. As the oldest of four children, all orphaned, she learned to cook out of necessity. Married at 16, a mother at 21, relocated to Savannah in the name of the war effort at 35, Sema went to work at Mrs. Dixon&#x2019;s Boardinghouse. Three years later, in 1943, she took over the boardinghouse and began building what would become her legacy. She lived in Savannah, Georgia, until her death in 2002.Ninety-four year old Sema Wilkes has been running her boardinghouse in Savannah, Ga., since 1943, cooking up traditional Southern favorites biscuits, collard greens, hush puppies for a clientele of gentlemen farmers, Girl Scouts and Yankee tourists. Indeed, the remembrances of Mrs. Wilkes and her family and friends are so entertaining that the book is best approached as a memoir/oral history interrupted by recipes for soups, casseroles, fried delights and desserts. The book vividly portrays a few of the eatery's more irregular regulars, including one Spanish Civil War veteran who, always arriving via tricycle, ate there every weekday for three decades. Equally well-rendered are the strong women who have helped Mrs. Wilkes in the kitchen throughout the years, including the late Mildred Capers, who judged the doneness of her fried chicken by the sound of the oil in the fryer. But it's not clear how some of these dishes would fare outside of Mrs. Wilkes's delightful environs; the Fried Chicken recipe lists the needed ingredients: flour, evaporated milk, salt and pepper, but obviously, it is the context Southern hospitality, fresh ingredients and an experienced kitchen staff that make it special. Also, a few oddities included in the book would have perhaps been best left on the boardinghouse table a Tango Salad, for instance, with lemon gelatin, canned pineapple and pimentos. Nevertheless, this is a delightful homage to Southern life. (May)Forecast: The continuing interest in Southern food, along with an ecstatic blurb from Craig Claiborne, should help this book's sales.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Easy Container Combos: Vegetables &amp; Flowers (Container Gardening Series)</h2><p>Pamela Crawford, container garden guru and the queen of easy gardening, has done it again in this groundbreaking book.

Like most people she was born with two, but unlike most people Mullins had to have both legs amputated below the knee due to a medical condition. Mullins has lived with no lower legs since her first birthday. <br>Mullins grew up in a middle-class family in the middle-class town of Allentown, Pennsylvania, yet her achievements are far from ordinary. Mullins&#x2019;s doctors suggested that an early amputation would give her the best chance to have a reasonable amount of mobility. As a child Mullins had no input into that decision, but as she grew up she refused to see herself as or to accept the label most people gave her&#x2014;&#x201c;disabled.&#x201d; Instead, she decided that prosthetic limbs would give her superpowers that others could only dream of. <br>Mullins redefines what it means to be disabled. As she told comedian and talk-show host Stephen Colbert, many actresses have more prosthetic material in their breasts than she does in her whole body, &#x201c;and we don&#x2019;t call half of Hollywood disabled.&#x201d; <br>Mullins tapped her superpower&#x2014;her prosthetic limbs&#x2014;to run track for an NCAA Division One program at Georgetown University. She broke three world records in track and field at the 1996 Paralympics, became a fashion model and an actress, and landed a spot on <i>People</i> magazine&#x2019;s annual list of the 50 Most Beautiful People. <br>In 2009 the 5'8" Mullins stood on the TED stage at 6'1" the height she chose for the occasion. Mullins picks different legs to suit the event. She uses more-functional limbs for walking the streets of Manhattan and more-fashionable ones for fancy parties. <br>&#x201c;TED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life&#x2019;s exploration,&#x201d;1 said Mullins. Mullins believes her TED appearance began a conversation that profoundly changed the way society looks at people with disabilities. Innovators, designers, and artists outside the traditional prosthetic medical community were inspired to see how creative and lifelike they could make legs. &#x201c;It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency. It&#x2019;s a conversation about potential. A prosthetic limb doesn&#x2019;t represent the need to replace loss anymore&nbsp;&#x2026; So people that society once considered to be disabled can now become the architects of their own identities and indeed continue to change those identities by designing their bodies from a place of empowerment&nbsp;&#x2026; it is our humanity, and all the potential within it, that makes us beautiful.&#x201d; <br>Mullins&#x2019;s determination made her a world-class athlete; her passion won the hearts of the TED audience. <br>Secret #1: Unleash the Master Within <br>Dig deep to identify your unique and meaningful connection to your presentation topic. Passion leads to mastery and your presentation is nothing without it, but keep in mind that what fires you up might not be the obvious. Aimee Mullins isn&#x2019;t passionate about prosthetics; she&#x2019;s passionate about unleashing human potential. <br>Why it works: Science shows that passion is contagious, literally. You cannot inspire others unless you are inspired yourself. You stand a much greater chance of persuading and inspiring your listeners if you express an enthusiastic, passionate, and meaningful connection to your topic. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>IN OCTOBER 2012, CAMERON RUSSELL told a TEDx audience, &#x201c;Looks aren&#x2019;t everything.&#x201d;2 Clich�? Yes, if it had been delivered by anyone else. Russell, however, is a successful fashion model. Within thirty seconds of taking the stage Russell changed her outfit. She covered her revealing, tight-fitting black dress with a wraparound skirt, replaced her eight-inch heels with plain shoes, and pulled a turtleneck sweater over her head. <br>&#x201c;So why did I do that?&#x201d; she asked the audience. &#x201c;Image is powerful, but also image is superficial. I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds.&#x201d; <br>Russell explained that she&#x2019;s an underwear model who has walked runways for Victoria&#x2019;s Secret and has appeared on the covers of fashion magazines. While Russell acknowledges that modeling has been good to her&#x2014;it paid for college&#x2014;she&#x2019;s also keenly aware that she &#x201c;won the genetic lottery.&#x201d; <br>Russell showed the audience a series of before-and-after photos. The &#x201c;before&#x201d; photos revealed what she looked like earlier in the day of a photo shoot and the &#x201c;after&#x201d; photos displayed the final ad. Of course the two photographs didn&#x2019;t look at all alike. In one photo, Russell&#x2014;16 years old at the time&#x2014;was seductively posed with a young man whose hand was placed in the back pocket of her jeans (Russell had never even had a boyfriend at the time of the shoot). &#x201c;I hope what you&#x2019;re seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me. They are constructions, and they are constructions by a group of professionals, by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and preproduction and postproduction. They build this. That&#x2019;s not me.&#x201d; <br>Russell is a master of her craft&#x2014;modeling. But modeling is not what she&#x2019;s passionate about. She&#x2019;s passionate about raising self-esteem in young girls, and that&#x2019;s why she connects with her audience. Passion is contagious. &#x201c;The real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery, and I am the recipient of a legacy, and maybe you&#x2019;re wondering what is a legacy. Well, for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we&#x2019;re biologically programmed to admire, but also as tall, slender figures, and femininity and white skin. And this is a legacy that was built for me, and it&#x2019;s a legacy that I&#x2019;ve been cashing in on.&#x201d; <br>Russell&#x2019;s looks made her a model; her passion made her a successful speaker. <br>Russell and Mullins were given a platform because they are masters in their fields, but they connect with their audiences because they are passionate about their topics. What fuels a speaker&#x2019;s passion does not always involve their day-to-day work. Russell didn&#x2019;t talk about posing for photographs, and Mullins didn&#x2019;t talk about competing in track and field. Yet each gave the talk of her life. <br>The most popular TED speakers share something in common with the most engaging communicators in any field&#x2014;a passion, an obsession they must share with others. The most popular TED speakers don&#x2019;t have a &#x201c;job.&#x201d; They have a passion, an obsession, a vocation, but not a job. These people are called to share their ideas. <br>People cannot inspire others unless and until they are inspired themselves. &#x201c;In our culture we tend to equate thinking and intellectual powers with success and achievement. In many ways, however, it is an emotional quality that separates those who master a field from the many who simply work at a job,&#x201d;3 writes Robert Greene in <i>Mastery</i>. &#x201c;Our levels of desire, patience, persistence and confidence end up playing a much larger role in success than sheer reasoning powers. Feeling motivated and energized, we can overcome almost anything. Feeling bored and restless, our minds shut off and we become increasingly passive.&#x201d; Motivated and energized speakers are always more interesting and engaging than bored and passive ones. <br>I&#x2019;m often asked to work with CEOs on major product launches or initiatives, helping them to tell their brand stories more effectively and persuasively. I travel around the world to visit brands such as Intel, Coca-Cola, Chevron, Pfizer, and many other companies in nearly every product category. In any language, on any continent, in every country, those speakers who genuinely express their passion and enthusiasm for the topic are the ones who stand apart as inspiring leaders. They&#x2019;re the ones with whom customers want to conduct business. <br>For years I started with the same question during my coaching sessions with a client&#x2014;what are you passionate about? In the early stage of building a story, I don&#x2019;t care about the product as much as I care about why the speaker is fired up about the product or service. Howard Schultz, the founder of Starbucks, once told me he wasn&#x2019;t passionate about coffee as much as he was passionate about &#x201c;building a third place between work and home, a place where employees would be treated with respect and offer exceptional customer service.&#x201d; Coffee is the product, but Starbucks is in the business of customer service. Tony Hsieh, the founder of online retailer Zappos, isn&#x2019;t passionate about shoes. He told me he&#x2019;s passionate about &#x201c;delivering happiness.&#x201d; The questions he asks himself are: How do I make my employees happy? How do I make my customers happy? The questions you ask will lead to a very different set of results. Asking yourself, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s my product?&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t nearly as effective as asking yourself, &#x201c;What business am I really in? What am I truly passionate about?&#x201d; <br>Tony Hsieh is so passionate about customer service and employee engagement, he is a sought-after speaker at events and conferences around the world (he has to turn down far more requests than he accepts). Since many speakers are bone-dry because they have no passionate attachment to the topic, watching an enthusiastic speaker is as refreshing as drinking ice-cold water in the desert. <br>WHAT MAKES YOUR HEART SING? <br>Recently I&#x2019;ve started to change the first question I ask of my executive clients who want to become better communicators. In his last major public presentation, Steve Jobs said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the intersection of technology and liberal arts that makes our hearts sing.&#x201d; So today I&#x2019;ve replaced &#x201c;What are you passionate about&#x201d; with &#x201c;What makes your heart sing?&#x201d; The answer to the second question is even more profound and exciting than the former. <br>For example, I worked with a client in the agribusiness community of California. He headed an association of strawberry growers, an important crop for the state. Here&#x2019;s how he answered my questions: <br>Question 1: What do you do? &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the CEO of the California Strawberry Commission.&#x201d; <br>Question 2: What are you passionate about? &#x201c;I&#x2019;m passionate about promoting California strawberries.&#x201d; <br>Question 3: What is it about the industry that makes your heart sing? &#x201c;The American dream. My parents were immigrants and worked in the fields. Eventually they were able to buy an acre of land and it grew from there. With strawberries, you don&#x2019;t need a lot of land and you don&#x2019;t need to own it; you can lease it. It&#x2019;s a stepping stone to the American dream.&#x201d; <br>I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll agree that the answer to the third question is much more interesting than the first two. What makes your heart sing? Identify it and share it with others. <br>TEDnote <br>WHAT MAKES YOUR HEART SING? Ask yourself, &#x201c;What makes my heart sing?&#x201d; Your passion is not a passing interest or even a hobby. A passion is something that is intensely meaningful and core to your identity. Once you identify what your passion is, can you say it influences your daily activities? Can you incorporate it into what you do professionally? Your true passion should be the subject of your communications and will serve to truly inspire your audience. <br>THE HAPPIEST MAN IN THE WORLD <br>Matthieu Ricard is the happiest man in the world, and he&#x2019;s not happy about it. In 2004 Matthieu Ricard temporarily left the Shechen monastery in Kathmandu to teach a TED audience in Monterey, California the habits of happiness. <br>According to Ricard, happiness is a &#x201c;deep sense of serenity and fulfillment.&#x201d; Ricard should know. He&#x2019;s not just pleased with his life. He&#x2019;s really, really happy. Scientifically, he&#x2019;s off-the-charts happy. Ricard volunteered for a study at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Research scientists placed 256 tiny electrodes on Ricard&#x2019;s scalp to measure his brain waves. The study was conducted on hundreds of people who practice meditation. They were rated on a happiness scale. Ricard didn&#x2019;t just score above average; the researchers couldn&#x2019;t find anything like it in the neuroscience literature. The brain scans showed &#x201c;excessive activity in his brain&#x2019;s left prefrontal cortex compared to its right counterpart, giving him an abnormally large capacity for happiness and a reduced propensity towards negativity.&#x201d;4 <br>Ricard isn&#x2019;t all that happy about being labeled the happiest man in the world. &#x201c;In truth, anyone can find happiness if he or she looks for it in the right place,&#x201d;5 he said. &#x201c;Authentic happiness can only come from the long-term cultivation of wisdom, altruism, and compassion, and from the complete eradication of mental toxins, such as hatred, grasping, and ignorance.&#x201d; <br>Ricard&#x2019;s presentation, &#x201c;The Habits of Happiness,&#x201d; attracted more than two million views on TED.com. I believe Ricard&#x2019;s presentation was well received because Ricard radiates the joy of someone who is deeply committed to his topic. Indeed, Ricard told me, &#x201c;These ideas are dear to me not only because they brought me a lot of fulfillment, but because I am convinced that they can bring some good to society. I am particularly passionate to show that altruism and compassion are not luxuries, but essential needs to answer the challenges of our modern world. So, whenever I am asked to join a conference, I am glad to do so and be able to share my ideas.&#x201d;6 <br>Successful speakers can&#x2019;t wait to share their ideas. They have charisma and charisma is directly associated with how much passion the speaker has for his or her content. Charismatic speakers radiate joy and passion; the joy of sharing their experience and passion for how their ideas, products, or services will benefit their audiences. &#x201c;I believe that the best way to communicate with anyone is to first check the quality of your motivation: &#x2018;Is my motivation selfish or altruistic? Is my benevolence aimed at just a few or at the great number? For their short-term or their long-term good?&#x2019; Once we have a clear motivation, then communication flows easily,&#x201d; says Ricard. <br>Amazingly, if your motivation is to share your passion with your audience, it&#x2019;s likely that you&#x2019;ll feel less nervous about speaking in public or delivering that all-important presentation in front of your boss. I asked Ricard how he remains calm and relaxed in front of large audiences. Ricard believes that anyone can talk him- or herself into feeling joy, bliss, and happiness when they choose to do so. It all comes down to your motivation. If your only goal is to make a sale or to elevate your stature, you might fail to connect with your audience (and you&#x2019;ll place a lot of pressure on yourself). If, however, your goal is more altruistic&#x2014;giving your audience information to help them live better lives&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll make a deeper connection and feel more comfortable in your role. &#x201c;I am very happy to share ideas, but as an individual I have nothing to lose or to gain,&#x201d; said Ricard. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care about my image, I have no business deal to cut, and I am not trying to impress anyone. I am just full of joy to be able to say a few words about the fact that we vastly underestimate the power of transforming the mind.&#x201d; <br>WHY YOU WILL FAIL TO HAVE A GREAT CAREER <br>If you&#x2019;re not happy and passionate about the work you do, you might fail to have a great career, and if you&#x2019;re not having a great time at a great career, it will be harder for you to generate enthusiasm through your presentations. That&#x2019;s why career, happiness, and the ability to inspire people are connected. <br>The topic of career success consumes University of Waterloo economics professor Larry Smith. Smith is frustrated with today&#x2019;s college students. He&#x2019;s upset because most college students will pursue specific careers for the wrong reasons&#x2014;money, status, etc. According to Smith, those students will fail to have great careers. The only way to have a great...</p><h2>Fossil Capital: The Rise of Steam Power and the Roots of Global Warming</h2><p><b>How capitalism first promoted fossil fuels with the rise of steam power</b><br><br>The more we know about the catastrophic implications of climate change, the more fossil fuels we burn. How did we end up in this mess?&nbsp;In this masterful new history, Andreas Malm claims it all began in Britain with the rise of steam power. But why did manufacturers turn from traditional sources of power, notably water mills, to an engine fired by coal? Contrary to established views, steam offered neither cheaper nor more abundant energy&#x2014;but rather superior control of subordinate labour. Animated by fossil fuels, capital could concentrate production at the most profitable sites and during the most convenient hours, as it continues to do today. Sweeping from nineteenth-century Manchester to the emissions explosion in China, from the original triumph of coal to the stalled shift to renewables, this study hones in on the burning heart of capital and demonstrates, in unprecedented depth, that turning down the heat will mean a radical overthrow of the current economic order.</p><p><b>Andreas Malm</b> teaches human ecology at Lund University, Sweden. His work has appeared in journals such as <i>Environmental History</i>, <i>Historical Materialism</i>, <i>Antipode</i> and<i> Organization &amp; Environment</i>. He is the author, with Shora Esmailian, of <i>Iran on the Brink: Rising Workers and Threats of War</i>, and of half a dozen books in Swedish on political economy, the Middle East and climate change.&#x201c;Malm forcefully unmasks the assumption that economic growth has inevitably brought us to the brink of a hothouse Earth. Rather, as he shows in a subtle and surprising reinterpretation of the Industrial Revolution, it has been the logic of capital (especially the need to valorize immense sunk investments in fossil fuels), not technology or even industrialism per se, that has driven global warming.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Mike Davis, author of <i>Planet of Slums</i> and <i>Ecology of Fear</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;<i>Fossil Capital</i> is a theoretical masterpiece and a political-economic-ecological manifesto.

But are those answers reliable? In this systematic text, Douglas Groothuis makes a comprehensive apologetic case for Christian theism--proceeding from a defense of objective truth to a presentation of the key arguments for God from natural theology to a case for the credibility of Jesus, the incarnation and the resurrection. Throughout, Groothuis considers alternative views and how they fare intellectually.</p><p><strong>Douglas Groothuis</strong> (Ph.D., philosophy, University of Oregon) is professor of philosophy at Denver Seminary and teaches philosophy at Metropolitan State College of Denver. He is the author of ten books, including <em>Truth Decay, Unmasking the New Age, On Jesus, On Pascal</em> and <em>In Defense of Natural Theology</em> (coeditor and contributor). He has published two dozen academic articles in journals such as <em>Religious Studies, Think, Inquiry, Sophia</em> and <em>Philosophia Christi</em>."I found this to be an excellent resource and a must-have for the library of anyone with any interest in defending the faith--from beginner level to advanced. . . . I commend Groothius for providing such a useful resource that many will benefit from for years to come." (Devin Pellew, Christian Apologetics Journal, Spring 2013)<br><br>"Groothuis offers as clear and as convincing a short exposition of the ontological argument as I have read. . . . As well as Christian apologists, students of the philosophy of religion should find this a useful book." (Paul Richardson, England On Sunday, January 22, 2012)<br><br>"<em>Christian Apologetics</em> is undergirded throughout with solid scholarship, razor-sharp reasoning, and copious footnotes. . . . The thoughtful layperson will be guided along the author's line of reasoning in logical progression. . . . By applying cogent insights in the book, the church can truly turn the world upside down for the glory of God." (Robert Velarde, Christian Research Journal, Vol. 34, No. 06)<br><br>"Douglas Groothuis does Christian apologetics the way it needs to be done, situating apologetics within a Christian worldview and answering the troubling questions that people are actually asking--questions to which they need answers if faith is going to be a live option. His book draws on many years of teaching and writing about apologetics, distilling the most effective arguments in defense of the Christian faith." (William A. Dembski, author of The End of Christianity)<br><br><em>"Christian Apologetics</em> is an outstanding book that I wholeheartedly endorse. It is one of the most thorough, insightful and well-written apologetics books I have read in a long time. Groothuis has the rare ability to write in a way that is understandable to the nonspecialist and yet rigorous enough to challenge the apologetic connoisseur. I wish every Christian would read this book carefully and then pass it on to a skeptic for discussion, interaction and dialogue." (Sean McDowell, author of Apologetics for a New Generation)<br><br>"Groothuis is a leading evangelical thinker and <em>Christian Apologetics</em> is a monumental result of decades of study and reflection. Breathtaking in scope, clear in style, this book is now the go-to text in the field. I know of nothing like it, and I enthusiastically recommend it to all who want to learn to give an answer for the hope that is within them." (J. P. Moreland, author of The God Question)<br><br>"<em>Christian Apologetics</em> is a full-scale defense of the Christian faith that is accessible, relevant and wise. This book not only reflects the work of a seasoned apologist; it is written with passion and conviction. I heartily recommend it!"

For the past 40 years, in conjunction with Harvard&#x2019;s Peabody Museum, he and his colleagues have documented how interest-bearing debt was invented in Bronze Age Mesopotamia, and then disseminated to the ancient world. What the Bronze Age rulers understood was that avoiding economic instability required regular royal debt cancellations. Professor Hudson documents dozens of these these royal edicts and traces the archeological record and history of debt, and how societies have dealt with (or failed to deal with) the proliferation of debts that cannot be paid &#x2013; and their consequences. In the pages of <strong><em>...and forgive them their debts</em></strong>, readers will discover how debt played a central role in shaping ancient societies, and how it continues to shape our world &#x2013; often destructively.</p><p><strong>The Big Question:</strong> What happens when debts cannot be paid? Will there be a writedown in favor of debtors (as is routinely done for large corporations), or will creditors be allowed to foreclose (as is done to personal debtors and mortgagees), leading to the creditors' political takeover of the economy&#x2019;s assets &#x2013; and ultimately the government itself? Historically, the remedy of record was the royal Clean Slate proclamation, or biblical Jubilee Year of debt forgiveness.</p><p><strong>The Real Message of Jesus:</strong> Jesus&#x2019;s first sermon announced that he had come to proclaim a Clean Slate debt cancellation (the Jubilee Year), as was first described in the Bible (<em>Leviticus 25</em>), and had been used in Babylonia since Hammurabi&#x2019;s dynasty. This message &#x2013; more than any other religious claim &#x2013; is what threatened his enemies, and is why he was put to death. This interpretation has been all but expunged from our contemporary understanding of the phrase, &#x201c;<em>...and forgive them their debts</em>,&#x201d; in The Lord&#x2019;s Prayer. It has been changed to &#x201c;<em>...and forgive them their trespasses (or sins)</em>,&#x201d; depending on the particular Christian tradition that influenced the translation from the Greek <em>opheil&#x113;ma/opheilet&#x113;s </em>(debts/debtors).</p><p><strong>Contrary to the message of Jesus,</strong> also found in the Old Testament of&nbsp;the Bible and in other ancient texts, debt repayment has become sanctified and mystified as a way of moralizing claims on borrowers, allowing creditor elites and oligarchs the leverage to take over societies and privatize personal and public assets &#x2013; especially in hard times. Historically, no monarchy or government has survived takeover by creditor elites and oligarchs (<em>viz</em>: Rome). Perhaps most striking is that &#x2013; according to a nearly complete consensus of Assyriologists and biblical scholars &#x2013; the Bible is preoccupied with debt forgiveness more than with sin.</p><p><strong>In a time of increasing economic and political polarization</strong>, and a global economy deeper in debt than at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, <strong><em>...and forgive them their debts</em></strong> documents what individuals, governments and societies can learn from the ancient past for restoring economic and social stability today.</p></p><p>Michael Hudson is a veteran of Wall Street and Distinguished Research Professor of Economics at the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC), and Professor of Economics at Peking University. He is President of the Institute for the Study of Long-Term Economic Trends (ISLET), and the co-editor of The International Scholars Conference on Ancient Near Eastern Economies (ISCANEE) series (5 volumes), sponsored by the Harvard Peabody Museum. He has consulted with the U.S. and foreign governments on taxation, balance of payments, financial bubbles, land policy and financial reform. He gives speeches, lectures and presentations throughout the world for official and unofficial groups reflecting diverse academic, economic and political constituencies. This book, ...and forgive them their debts, is Volume I of the trilogy, THE TYRANNY OF DEBT.<p>The American economist Michael Hudson has written a fascinating book, <strong> . . . and forgive them their debts: Lending, Foreclosure and Redemption From Bronze Age Finance to the Jubilee Year</strong> on the historical antecedents of the Mosaic debt jubilee. The work of Assyriologists has shown that by the third millennium BC, the rulers of the ancient Near East understood the necessity of repeated debt forgiveness. The alternative was, he writes, &#x201c;economic polarisation, bondage and collapse&#x201d;. The relevance of this history to the world of today seems clear: debt is necessary; too much debt is disastrous.<br> <strong>&#x2013; Martin Wolf</strong>, Chief Economics Commentator, Financial Times</p><p>Michael Hudson is surely the most innovative, and in my view, the most important economic historian of the last half century. This is the consummate product of more than 30 years of research on the history of a subject that could not be more important to our own situation today. We like to use the term &#x201c;ancient history&#x201d; as a code-word for &#x201c;of no possible relevance to matters of consequence today.&#x201d; This book clearly demonstrates that nothing could be further from the truth. If we don&#x2019;t take heed, ancient history is likely to engulf us in ways that will shatter our complacency in the most disastrous of ways. Hudson is giving us a desperately needed warning, and we would do well to pay very close attention.&nbsp;<br> <strong>&#x2013;&nbsp;</strong><strong>David Graeber</strong>, Professor of Anthropology at the London School of Economics, author of the international bestseller,&nbsp;<em>Debt: The First 5,000 Years</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Michael&nbsp;Hudson's excavation of the ancient historical roots of the Jubilee, Sabbath or sabbatical principle, common to all the Abrahamic faiths, makes this book an essential read for those who want to deepen their understanding of the world's great religions. As someone in the leadership of the international Jubilee 2000 campaign, I have always believed that the Judaic and Christian principle of Jubilee &#x2013; the periodic correction of economic imbalances &#x2013; was a principle of social justice deeply embedded in the human psyche.&nbsp; Prof. Hudson&#x2019;s account of the evolution of creditor-debtor relationships, as well as of the development of the rate of interest in ancient Assyria makes this book of particular relevance to historians of western economic thought and practice. But above all,&nbsp;his book reminds us that human history is littered with bitter struggles between debtors and their creditors, between the landed and the landless, and between workers and rentiers.

Lovecraft's fiction in a treasury guaranteed to bring fright and delight both to longtime fans and to readers new to his work. Early stories such as "The Outsider," "The Music of Erich Zann," "Herbert West&#x2013;Reanimator," and "The Lurking Fear" demonstrate Lovecraft's uncanny ability to blur the distinction between reality and nightmare, sanity and madness, the human and non-human. "The Horror at Red Hook" and "He" reveal the fascination and revulsion Lovecraft felt for New York City; "Pickman's Model" uncovers the frightening secret behind an artist's work; "The Rats in the Walls" is a terrifying descent into atavistic horror; and "The Colour Out of Space" explores the eerie impact of a meteorite on a remote Massachusetts valley. <br><br>In such later works as "The Call of Cthulhu," "The Whisperer in Darkness," "At the Mountains of Madness," "The Shadow Over Innsmouth," and "The Shadow Out of Time," Lovecraft developed his own nightmarish mythology in which encounters with ancient, pitiless extraterrestrial intelligences wreak havoc on hapless humans who only gradually begin to glimpse "terrifying vistas of reality, and our frightful position therein." Moving from old New England towns haunted by occult pasts to Antarctic wastes that disclose appalling secrets, Lovecraft's tales continue to exert a dread fascination.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

Now Lovecraft (1890&#x2013;1937), the most important U.S. horror writer since Edgar Allan Poe and a big influence on nearly every major figure in the genre after his day, has been honored with a volume of his own in this prestigious series. Drawing from scholar S.T. Joshi's definitive texts, Peter Straub, the bestselling author of <i>In the Night Room</i>, has selected 22 works of fiction, ranging from such traditional ghostly tales as "The Outsider" and "The Rats in the Walls" to such lengthy cosmic narratives as "The Call of Cthulhu" and "At the Mountains of Madness." This edition represents the latest scholarship, including a recently discovered missing passage from "The Shadow Out of Time" and a few new minor corrections. Some may quibble over the inclusion of the pulpish "Herbert West&#x2014;Reanimator" and the even worse "The Lurking Fear," though they're of interest as rare examples of Lovecraft aiming to please an audience other than himself. Still, all the best fiction is here in a book sure to help reinforce Lovecraft's place in the American literary canon. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For as long as she could remember, she had been fascinated by the spirited wild mustangs that roamed free throughout the West. So when greedy cattlemen started to round up the mustangs for slaughter, Annie knew it was up to her to save the breed. <br> The true story of Wild Horse Annie's crusade to save the mustangs is inspiring. Readers will cheer her on, all the way to the White House, in her struggle to preserve these beautiful creatures from extinction.</p><p>Marguerite Henry was the beloved author of such classic horse stories as <i>King of the Wind, Misty of Chincoteague,</i> and <i>Stormy: Misty&#x2019;s Foal,</i> all of which are available in Aladdin paperback editions.<br><br>Robert Lougheed was raised on a farm in Canada where he developed a passion for painting.

Saved by a Mustang<p></p> <br>IF GOD has a kind of plan for all of us, I like to think He coupled me with horses right from the start. It is not just my own mustang, Hobo, that is part of me. All horses call to me. We sort of belong together. This could not be just an accident.<br> <br>I remember the first time I saw a band of wild mustangs. It was only a flash. My Pa and I were freighting a load of wool over the mountains to California when suddenly he reined in and pointed. I saw the reason. Far off on a mesa a string of mustangs was running into the wind. It must have been into the wind, for their tails streamed out behind and their manes lifted like licks of flame. And just by looking I was out there with them, and I could hear their snortings and their hoofs ringing, and I could feel my own hair blowing and my lungs gulping for air, and I shivered in joy at such freedom.<br> <br>I remember whispering, &#x201c;Whose are they, Pa?&#x201d;<br> <br>And Pa saying, &#x201c;They&#x2019;re runaways&#x2014;gone wild.&#x201d; There was a look of wanting in Pa&#x2019;s face, but excitement too at the free wildness.<br> <br>&#x201c;Will they always live there, free like that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then their colts and grand-colts?&#x201d;<br> <br>Pa startled me with his sudden stern tone. &#x201c;They could! If men don&#x2019;t get too grabby for every smitch of land for their cattle.&#x201d;<br> <br>Even as he said it, a cow bawled nearby. And in the distance a fading line of dust was all that remained of the wild ones.<br> <br>Pa clucked to his team and we drove off. For miles of mountain turns we rode in silence. We were still holding onto the beauty we had seen. I could still hear the echo of faraway hoofbeats. I could listen to nothing else. Yet even as I sighed in joy I felt a vague, uneasy worry. I didn&#x2019;t want anything ever to happen to them; I wanted them always to be free. But could they?<br> <br>That was the first time horses called to me. But now I know that God had a plan for me long before that. On clear, cold nights when the stars are all in their rightful places I know He had me in mind as long ago as that time when my Pa was just a baby and almost died on the desert. But he didn&#x2019;t die because&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, the cowards never started<br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the weak ones died by the way&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&#x201d;<br> <br>That&#x2019;s how my Grandma always began the true story of how my Pa was saved. Then she&#x2019;d clear her throat, moisten her lips, and with a look of joy upon her face she&#x2019;d plunge into her covered-wagon days.<br> <br>&#x201c;Our wagon rolled through dust. A choking, sneezy wilderness of dust&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from nowhere to nowhere.&#x201d; She paused a moment, her small bright eyes remembering. She stared over my head as if the whole panorama of her pioneer days was flashing on the wall behind me. &#x201c;Our four horses made furrows through it, kicking up great clouds of dust that turned the brown-coated ones to gray and the gray ones to white. Even Nelly&#x2019;s colt tagging along beside her was fuzzy-furred with dust, and its whiskers white like a goat&#x2019;s.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;Annie!&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say. &#x201c;Your Pa couldn&#x2019;t of come into this world at a worser time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why, Grandma?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d ask. Even when I got to be ten or eleven, I&#x2019;d still ask &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; right there. And she&#x2019;d say:<br> <br>&#x201c;Why? Because we hadn&#x2019;t a home, and barely enough vittles to last to California. And no money to buy more. That&#x2019;s why.<br> <br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d you like it, Annie, if one day your husband is foreman of a big silver mine in lone, Nevada. And you have a nice home with pretties on the what-not and red geraniums growing all over the windows, and all to once the mine closes down. Just like that!<br> <br>&#x201c;And the very next day,&#x201d; here Grandma&#x2019;s voice turned softer, &#x201c;you bring into the world the cutest button-nosed baby ever, and hardly a bunting to wrap him in. If he&#x2019;d just of waited till we got to my people in Grass Valley&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But he didn&#x2019;t!&#x201d; I crowed. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m glad, because then there wouldn&#x2019;t be any story. Go on, Grandma. Go on!&#x201d;<br> <br>Grandma&#x2019;s eyes narrowed and her jaw muscles tightened. &#x201c;The reason we hadn&#x2019;t any money was because that scalawag of a mine-owner skips off to San Francisco. He promises to come back with a big roll of money, enough to pay off the miners. But what does he do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He never comes back!&#x201d; I filled in.<br> <br>&#x201c;And what does your dear sweet crazy Grandpa do?&#x201d;<br> <br>Here I always waited for Grandma to blow up with pride.<br> <br>&#x201c;He parcels out all his own money so the miners could buy wagons and light out for greener pastures. And they did. Meanwhile, we wait weeks and weeks while our little village turns into a ghost town. Then we have to leave, too. We decide to go to Grass Valley, California, where my folks lived. That last morning I watered my geraniums just like always and pinched off the dead ones. Your Grandpa hooked up our four mustangs that he had caught and gentled, and off we went in the wagon that I&#x2019;d roofed over with our bedsheets.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Were there only four mustangs?&#x201d;<br> <br>Grandma&#x2019;s eyes came to mine and smiled. &#x201c;Besides the leaders and wheelers there was a skinny little colt tagging along free. He&#x2019;d make little forays of his own and then come kiting back to Nelly.&#x201d; Grandma stroked my head now as if I was a colt, and she talked fast to get to the miracle.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;Nelly&#x2019;s colt and my baby, who is now your Pa, were born at almost the same hour. Your Grandpa was so busy running betwixt her and me I wondered which mattered more, and when both babies were safely born he was nigh as proud of Nelly&#x2019;s colt as of his own son. Seems the colt had some Arabian or Andalusian blood in him that set him off as something special.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, like I said, we hooked up our mustangs and started off, the colt trailing along. A few days later we run out of water. Everywhere we look there&#x2019;s nothing but dust and rocks and sand and dust and dust and dust. Sometimes we&#x2019;d ride all day without seeing anything else. When we come to water, it&#x2019;s more like soapsuds, and I try to drink it, but it won&#x2019;t go down. And my milk for Baby Joe dries up. But Nelly is smarter. She eats any old rabbit brush or sagebrush, and her milk runs free and she nurses her colt, but I can&#x2019;t nurse my baby.&#x201d;<br> <br>My eyes were fixed on Grandma&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Then what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My baby yelled at first, hour after hour. Then he whimpered. And in no time it seemed he got all shriveled looking, like a little old man. One day your Grandpa says, &#x2018;There ain&#x2019;t no other way. Nelly&#x2019;s got to be Baby Joe&#x2019;s nurser.&#x2019; And he milked Nelly and we spooned her milk into the baby&#x2019;s mouth, a slow drop at a time.&#x201d;<br> <br>The miracle held us both in a web of stillness. I imagined I was right there, helping to milk Nelly, and spoon-feeding Grandma&#x2019;s baby, who was my Pa.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your Grandpa was glad Baby Joe was saved. But a few days later a misery came over him when he told me he had to kill Nelly&#x2019;s colt. &#x2018;I got to do it,&#x2019; he said, his eyes full of hurt. &#x2018;She ain&#x2019;t got enough milk for two.&#x2019; Oh, Annie, it hurt him so. He&#x2019;d rather of shot off his right arm. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll just wait till morning,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;and then I&#x2019;ll do it. Painless as I can.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The wind woke us up next morning, tearing at our wagon flaps. When we looked out, all our horses were gone! Nothing left but hoofprints circling the camp, making off in all directions like the spokes of a wheel.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your Grandpa howled like a savage. &#x2018;Injuns done it!&#x2019; he yelled. &#x2018;Only Injuns could thieve so quiet.&#x2019; He buckled on his cartridge belt, a wild look in his eye.<br> <br>&#x201c;He was right. Almost at once three young Paiutes appeared out of the brush. Their faces were smeared with green and red paint, and their heads decked out in crow feathers. They were riding scrawny cayuses. It was plain to see why our stout horses were worth the stealing.<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2018;Grub!&#x2019; the oldest one muttered. He pointed at our wagon traces, showing he was ready to trade for our missing team.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pa&#x2019;s hand reached for his gun; it was all I could do to stop him. Then I ran for the wagon and brought out little Joe. He made pitiful cries of hunger and he seemed all mouth, like a baby bird. I made sign talk to the Indians&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how my baby would die if they didn&#x2019;t bring Nelly back.<br> <br>&#x201c;The oldest one grinned. &#x2018;What you give?&#x2019;<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2018;You find our horses first,&#x2019; your Grandpa threatened. &#x2018;Bring all back. Then we parley. We make gifts.&#x2019;<br> <br>&#x201c;They left as silently as they came. Meanwhile I prayed and hugged the baby, and your Grandpa paced in fury around the wagon, his rifle held in front of him. After what seemed a long time the Paiutes came back, leading our four mustangs, three of them willing, but Nelly a-balkin&#x2019; and a-whinnerin&#x2019; for her colt. This time the faces of the Indians were grim.</p><h2>Raymie Nightingale</h2><p>"A big-hearted novel about three girls who forge a friendship over the summer, and help each other navigate difficult family dynamics. Bestselling and award-winning author Kate DiCamillo's <i>Raymie Nightingale</i> is perfect for early tween readers who want a strong story of friendship and hope that includes a lot of laughs." - Seira Wilson, Amazon Editor<br><br><b><b>A 2016 National Book Award Finalist!</b></b><br> <br><b>Two-time Newbery Medalist Kate DiCamillo returns to her roots with a moving, masterful story of an unforgettable summer friendship.</b><br><br>Raymie Clarke has come to realize that everything, absolutely everything, depends on her. And she has a plan. If Raymie can win the Little Miss Central Florida Tire competition, then her father, who left town two days ago with a dental hygienist, will see Raymie's picture in the paper and (maybe) come home. To win, not only does Raymie have to do good deeds and learn how to twirl a baton; she also has to contend with the wispy, frequently fainting Louisiana Elefante, who has a show-business background, and the fiery, stubborn Beverly Tapinski, who&#x2019;s determined to sabotage the contest. But as the competition approaches, loneliness, loss, and unanswerable questions draw the three girls into an unlikely friendship &#x2014; and challenge each of them to come to the rescue in unexpected ways.</p><p><b>Kate DiCamillo</b> is one of America&#x2019;s most beloved storytellers. She is the National Ambassador for Young People&#x2019;s Literature and a two-time Newbery Medalist. Born in Philadelphia, she grew up in Florida and now lives in Minneapolis, where she faithfully writes two pages a day, five days a week.With its short, vibrant chapters and clear, gentle prose, this triumphant and necessary book conjures the enchantments of childhood without shying away from the fraught realities of abandonment, abuse and neglect...Twirling a baton requires flair and confidence, in addition to an understanding that the baton is always balanced just a tiny bit off-center. There is something wonderfully off-balance, too, about �DiCamillo&#x2019;s storytelling. It allows her characters to sparkle and soar. DiCamillo has called this novel, based partly on her own fatherless Florida childhood, "the absolutely true story of my heart." What a beautiful and generous heart it is.<br>&#x2014;The New York Times Book Review<br><br>As in her previous award-winning books, DiCamillo once again shows that life&#x2019;s underlying sadnesses can also be studded with hope and humor, and does it in a way so true that children will understand it in their bones. And that&#x2019;s why she&#x2019;s Kate the Great.<br>&#x2014;Booklist (starred review)<br><br>DiCamillo's third-person narrative is written in simple words, few exceeding three syllables, yet somehow such modest prose carries the weight of deep meditations on life, death, the soul, friendship, and the meaning of life without ever seeming heavy, and there's even a miracle to boot. Readers will approach the tense and dramatic conclusion and realize how much each word matters. Raymie may not find answers to why the world exists or how the world works, but she can hold onto friends and begin to see more clearly the world as it is...Once again, DiCamillo demonstrates the power of simple words in a beautiful and wise tale.<br>&#x2014;Kirkus Reviews (starred review)<br><br>With extraordinary skill, two-time Newbery Medalist DiCamillo traces the girls&#x2019; growing trust in each other while using understated confessionals and subtly expressed yearnings to show how tragedies have affected each of them. The book culminates with a daring cat-rescue mission: fraught with adventure, danger, and a miracle or two, the escapade reveals how love and compassion can overcome even the highest hurdles.<br>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly (starred review)<br><br>The girls don&#x2019;t form an immediate bond, but their initial association of convenience eventually turns into a friendship of understanding and fierce loyalty. After christening the trio the Three Rancheros, Louisiana delivers these prescient words: &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll rescue each other.&#x201d; And in a beautifully layered set of adventures, they do. The limited third-person narration gives Raymie her distinctive voice and spot-on pre-adolescent perspective of a young girl trying to make sense of the world around her. Here DiCamillo returns&#x2014;triumphantly&#x2014;to her <i>Winn-Dixie </i>roots.<br>&#x2014;The Horn Book (starred review)<br><br>In short, precisely crafted chapters, DiCamillo once again demonstrates her ability to create unique characters that touch readers&#x2019; hearts. Raymie, in particular, is observant, thoughtful, and sensitive as she struggles to make sense of the world around her. Her story unfolds in uncomplicated prose, even as the themes explored are complex. Surrounded by the fully realized Louisiana and Beverly, not to mention the adults in her town, Raymie searches for meaning, a search that will resonate with readers. Poignant, insightful, and ultimately uplifting.<br>&#x2014;School Library Journal (starred review)<br><br>From start to finish, Raymie feels her soul alternately shrinking and expanding like an indecisive balloon as she and her new entourage navigate the waters of friendship and heartbreak, love and loss, life and death. Most of the characters in this fine, funny, meticulously crafted novel live life "wishing for things that are gone," but there's certainly no chance that Raymie's lovely and large soul will ever completely shrivel with a "Phhhhtttt."<br>&#x2014;Shelf Awareness (starred review)<br><br>Although this story is fictional, DiCamillo describes it as the true story of her heart...DiCamillo does a wonderful job of allowing readers into the depths of Raymie&#x2019;s feelings and even into her soul. By the end of the book, readers feel like Raymie, Beverly, and Louisiana are true and lasting friends of their own. It is truly a heart-filled and heartfelt book.<br>&#x2014;VOYA<br><br>Fans will recognize DiCamillo's unique wry voice as it gives readers vivid images, dizzying ideas, humor, heart-wrenching emotions, and gorgeous, gorgeous language. You all have something to look forward to this April, I promise.<br>&#x2014;Huffington Post<br><br>DiCamillo writes with her usual easygoing delicacy; the portray- als of the girls are swift, telling, and gentle, with elliptical hints at Beverly&#x2019;s and especially Louisiana&#x2019;s homelife challenges (lack of money clearly limits Louisiana&#x2019;s diet)...While DiCamillo fans will certainly enjoy reading this on their own, it&#x2019;s also excellent classroom material, encouraging kids to stretch their decoding&#x2014;and also to realize that even if you don&#x2019;t get the outcome you want, it&#x2019;s still possible to find closure.<br>&#x2014;Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books<br><br>It&#x2019;s an inspired choice, for surely this coming-of-age story is a fairy tale for our times.

And a book like this can help. As Raymie&#x2019;s neighbor told her before dying, &#x201c;If you were in a hole that was deep enough and if it was daylight and you looked up at the sky from the very deep hole, you could see stars even though it was the middle of the day.&#x201d; For children looking up from their own deep holes, the Three Rancheros could be those stars.<br>&#x2014;TIME Magazine<br><br>Kate DiCamillo seems always to write with an understanding heart and a gentle archness of tone...As the summer progresses, the girls find poignant points of commonality and a surprising comradeship in this wistful, tender, funny novel for readers ages 10 and older.<br>&#x2014;The Wall Street Journal<br><br>Raymie Nightingale is filled with humor, poignancy, and life-sized lessons.

Dimont shows how the saga of the Jews is interwoven with the story of virtually every nation on earth.</p><p>Max I. Dimont, author of <b>The Indestructible Jews, The Jews in America, The Amazing Adventures of the Jewish People,</b> and <b>Appointment in Jerusalem</b>, was born in Helsinki, Finland, and came to the United States in 1930. He taught himself English by reading Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays, the Bible, and American plays translated into Finnish. After serving in intelligence with the U.S. Army during World War II, he worked in public relations and employee relations for Edison Brothers Stores in St. Louis. Following the first publication of the bestselling <b>Jews, God and History</b>, he lectured extensively on Jewish history throughout the United States, Canada, South Africa, Brazil, and Finland until his death in 1992.Referencing the Old Testament and Palestine&#39;s influence on world civilization, Finnish-American Dimont&#39;s secular history of the Jewish people was a surprise bestseller when originally published, and it has remained in print for more than twenty years. Deservedly so, for, despite quibbles from historians and religious partisans, the author has turned four thousand years in the life of one people into a lively, canny, authoritative, brainy and informative page-turner. To appreciate this audio, one must accept the kind of trade-offs encountered when a work that exists in space is translated into a work that exists in time. These include the inability to refer to indices, improbabilities of translating charts and graphs to sound, troubles going back and forth with footnotes, the need for heavy concentration to absorb the sheer density of data. On the plus side, one enjoys the accurate pronunciation of foreign words and phrases, as well as the narrator&#39;s animation of concepts and events. Anna Fields does a nice job here.

C. Leyendecker:: A Gallery of Beefcakes</h2><p>From Weekly Publishers -&#34;Homo-Erotic follows the artist&#39;s life from his humble beginnings to his success and, finally, to his death in 1951. The format of the biography is appealing and attractive. The pages are replete with clear black and white reproductions of Leyendecker&#39;s paintings as well as photographs of unclothed men who serve as surrogate Leyendecker models. The text is well researched and authentic; the writing style is free-flowing and the words capture the naturalness of Leyendecker&#39;s paintings.Public libraries and school libraries will want to add this fascinating, informative, and inspiring biography to their collections.&#34;</p><p>Book Review --"[Leyendecker's] great talent was that he knew that big size, gorgeous men could make people spend money," writes Homo-Erotic in this anecdotal biography. The well-chosen words join with crisp reproductions of his art to tell a heartrending story of this devoted chronicler of American social history who paid tribute to "roaring people doing roaring things"--among them: the elegant fashions of Cluett Peabody &amp; Company, (1905) who single-handedly increased their sales to $32 million a year because of Leyendecker &#x2018;s work for their Arrow Collar line for males; Ivory Soap, and Kelloggs, as well as magazine covers for such publications as Collier&#x2019;s and Success all became popular and earned millions off of Leyendecker&#x2019;s beautiful males in their advertises. Sketching his life, Homo-Erotic explains that, unlike his gregarious younger brother, Leyendecker was skinny and introverted, but he drew effortlessly and knew "that was what he wanted to do with his life." At age 16, while employed at an engraving firm, J. C. Leyendecker entered a contest to design a cover for Century magazine. When his prize-winning entry was issued as an art print, J. C. Leyendecker earned a good deal of money; especially skilled at drawing what today is called beefcake, he for years insisted on working from live models and later realized the efficiency and advantages of painting his live-in lover, including his celebrated Academic Nude In The Academie Julian. Leyendecker&#x2019;s covers for the Saturday Evening Post, of which he produced 332 over almost 50 years, validates a nickname he earned after his death: "the homosexual who made men look like they are made of cheesecakes." Homo-Erotic brings Leyendecker into sharp focus here with galleries of photos of nude male models."</p><h2>Joseph Anton: A Memoir</h2><p><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY</b><br> <b><i>San Francisco Chronicle � </i>Newsweek/The Daily Beast � <i>The&nbsp;Seattle Times � The Economist � Kansas City Star � BookPage</i></b><br><br>On February 14, 1989, Valentine&#x2019;s Day, Salman Rushdie was telephoned by a BBC journalist and told that he had been &#x201c;sentenced to death&#x201d; by the Ayatollah Khomeini. For the first time he heard the word <i>fatwa</i>. His crime? To have written a novel called <i>The Satanic Verses,</i> which was accused of being &#x201c;against Islam, the Prophet and the Quran.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> So begins the extraordinary story of how a writer was forced underground, moving from house to house, with the constant presence of an armed police protection team. He was asked to choose an alias that the police could call him by. He thought of writers he loved and combinations of their names; then it came to him: Conrad and Chekhov&#x2014;<i>Joseph Anton.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> How do a writer and his family live with the threat of murder for more than nine years? How does he go on working? How does he fall in and out of love? How does despair shape his thoughts and actions, how and why does he stumble, how does he learn to fight back? In this remarkable memoir Rushdie tells that story for the first time; the story of one of the crucial battles, in our time, for freedom of speech. He talks about the sometimes grim, sometimes comic realities of living with armed policemen, and of the close bonds he formed with his protectors; of his struggle for support and understanding from governments, intelligence chiefs, publishers, journalists, and fellow writers; and of how he regained his freedom.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is a book of exceptional frankness and honesty, compelling, provocative, moving, and of vital importance. Because what happened to Salman Rushdie was the first act of a drama that is still unfolding somewhere in the world every day.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Joseph Anton</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;<br></b>&#x201c;A harrowing, deeply felt and revealing document: an autobiographical mirror of the big, philosophical preoccupations that have animated Mr. Rushdie&#x2019;s work throughout his career.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times</i> </b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A splendid book, the finest . . . memoir to cross my desk in many a year.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Jonathan Yardley, <i>The Washington Post</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Thoughtful and astute . . . an important book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2014;USA Today</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Compelling, affecting . . . demonstrates Mr. Rushdie&#x2019;s ability as a stylist and storytelle. . . .

He is a former president of American PEN.Prologue<br> &nbsp;<br> The First Blackbird<br> &nbsp;<br> AFTERWARDS, WHEN THE WORLD WAS EXPLODING AROUND HIM AND THE lethal blackbirds were massing on the climbing frame in the school playground, he felt annoyed with himself for forgetting the name of the BBC reporter, a woman, who had told him that his old life was over and a new, darker existence was about to begin. She had called him at home on his private line without explaining how she got the number. &#x201c;How does it feel,&#x201d; she asked him, &#x201c;to know that you have just been sentenced to death by the Ayatollah Khomeini?&#x201d; It was a sunny Tuesday in London but the question shut out the light. This is what he said, without really knowing what he was saying: &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t feel good.&#x201d; This is what he thought: I&#x2019;m a dead man. He wondered how many days he had left to live and thought the answer was probably a single-digit number. He put down the telephone and ran down the stairs from his workroom at the top of the narrow Islington row house where he lived. The living room windows had wooden shutters and, absurdly, he closed and barred them. Then he locked the front door.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was Valentine&#x2019;s Day but he hadn&#x2019;t been getting on with his wife, the American novelist Marianne Wiggins. Six days earlier she had told him she was unhappy in the marriage, that she &#x201c;didn&#x2019;t feel good around him anymore,&#x201d; even though they had been married for little more than a year, and he, too, already knew it had been a mistake. Now she was staring at him as he moved nervously around the house, drawing curtains, checking window bolts, his body galvanized by the news as if an electric current were passing through it, and he had to explain to her what was happening. She reacted well, beginning to discuss what they should do next. She used the word &#x201c;we.&#x201d; That was courageous.<br> &nbsp;<br> A car arrived at the house, sent by CBS television. He had an appointment at the American network&#x2019;s studios in Bowater House, Knightsbridge, to appear live, by satellite link, on its morning show. &#x201c;I should go,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s live television. I can&#x2019;t just not show up.&#x201d; Later that morning the memorial service for his friend Bruce Chatwin was to be held at the Orthodox church on Moscow Road in Bayswater. Less than two years earlier he had celebrated his fortieth birthday at Homer End, Bruce&#x2019;s house in Oxfordshire. Now Bruce was dead of AIDS, and death had arrived at his own door as well. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What about the memorial,&#x201d; his wife asked. He didn&#x2019;t have an answer for her. He unlocked the front door, went outside, got into the car and was driven away, and although he did not know it then, so that the moment of leaving his home did not feel unusually freighted with meaning, he would not go back to that house, his home for five years, until three years later, by which time it was no longer his.<br> &nbsp;<br> The children in the classroom in Bodega Bay, California, sing a sad nonsense song. She combed her hair but once a year, ristle-te, rostle-te, mo, mo, mo. Outside the school a cold wind is blowing. A single blackbird flies down from the sky and settles on the climbing frame in the playground. The children&#x2019;s song is a roundelay. It begins but it doesn&#x2019;t end. It just goes round and round. With every stroke she shed a tear, ristle-te, rostle-te, hey-bombosity, knickety-knackety, retroquo-quality, willoby-wallaby, mo, mo, mo. There are four blackbirds on the climbing frame, and then a fifth arrives. Inside the school the children are singing. Now there are hundreds of blackbirds on the climbing frame and thousands more birds fill the sky, like a plague of Egypt. A song has begun, to which there is no end.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the first blackbird comes down to roost on the climbing frame it seems individual, particular, specific. It is not necessary to deduce a general theory, a wider scheme of things, from its presence. Later, after the plague begins, it&#x2019;s easy for people to see the first blackbird as a harbinger. But when it lands on the climbing frame it&#x2019;s just one bird.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the years to come he will dream about this scene, understanding that his story is a sort of prologue: the tale of the moment when the first blackbird lands. When it begins it&#x2019;s just about him; it&#x2019;s individual, particular, specific. Nobody feels inclined to draw any conclusions from it. It will be a dozen years and more before the story grows until it fills the sky, like the Archangel Gabriel standing upon the horizon, like a pair of planes flying into tall buildings, like the plague of murderous birds in Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s great film.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the CBS offices he was the big news story of the day. People in the newsroom and on various monitors were already using the word that would soon be hung around his neck like a millstone. They used the word as if it were a synonym for &#x201c;death sentence&#x201d; and he wanted to argue, pedantically, that that was not what the word meant. But from this day forward it would mean that for most people in the world. And for him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fatwa.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I inform the proud Muslim people of the world that the author of the &#x2018;Satanic Verses&#x2019; book, which is against Islam, the Prophet and the Qur&#x2019;an, and all those involved in its publication who were aware of its content, are sentenced to death. I ask all the Muslims to execute them wherever they find them.&#x201d; Somebody gave him a printout of the text as he was escorted toward the studio for his interview. Again, his old self wanted to argue, this time with the word &#x201c;sentence.&#x201d; This was not a sentence handed down by any court he recognized, or which had any jurisdiction over him. It was the edict of a cruel and dying old man. But he also knew that his old self&#x2019;s habits were of no use anymore. He was a new self now. He was the person in the eye of the storm, no longer the Salman his friends knew but the Rushdie who was the author of Satanic Verses, a title subtly distorted by the omission of the initial The. The Satanic Verses was a novel. Satanic Verses were verses that were satanic, and he was their satanic author, &#x201c;Satan Rushdy,&#x201d; the horned creature on the placards carried by demonstrators down the streets of a faraway city, the hanged man with protruding red tongue in the crude cartoons they bore. Hang Satan Rushdy. How easy it was to erase a man&#x2019;s past and to construct a new version of him, an overwhelming version, against which it seemed impossible to fight.<br> &nbsp;<br> King Charles I had denied the legitimacy of the sentence handed down against him. That hadn&#x2019;t stopped Oliver Cromwell from having him beheaded.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was no king. He was the author of a book.<br> &nbsp;<br> He looked at the journalists looking at him and he wondered if this was how people looked at men being taken to the gallows or the electric chair or the guillotine. One foreign correspondent came up to be friendly. He asked this man what he should think about what Khomeini had said. How seriously should he take it? Was it just a rhetorical flourish or something genuinely dangerous?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t worry too much,&#x201d; the journalist said. &#x201c;Khomeini sentences the president of the United States to death every Friday afternoon.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;On air, when he was asked how he responded to the threat, he said, &#x201c;I wish I&#x2019;d written a more critical book.&#x201d; He was proud, then and always, that he had said this. It was the truth. He did not feel his book was especially critical of Islam, but, as he said on American television that morning, a religion whose leaders behaved in this way could probably do with a little criticism.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the interview was over they told him his wife had called. He phoned the house. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t come back here,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;There are two hundred journalists on the sidewalk waiting for you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go to the agency,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Pack a bag and meet me there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His literary agency, Wylie, Aitken &amp; Stone, had its offices in a white-stuccoed house on Fernshaw Road in Chelsea. There were no journalists camped outside&#x2014;evidently the world&#x2019;s press hadn&#x2019;t thought he was likely to visit his agent on such a day&#x2014;and when he walked in every phone in the building was ringing and every call was about him.

Educators using the theory have achieved remarkable success in helping all students, including those who learn in nontraditional ways, to navigate school (and life outside it) with confidence and success.</p><p>Within the context of classroom instruction, no author besides Gardner has done more to popularize MI theory than Thomas Armstrong, whose best seller <em>Multiple Intelligences in the Classroom</em> has become a bona fide education classic in its own right. This expanded fourth edition provides educators at all levels with everything they need to apply MI theory to curriculum development, lesson planning, assessment, special education, cognitive skills, career development, educational policy, and more. </p><p>In addition to the many strategies, templates, and examples that have made Armstrong's book so enduringly popular, this edition is updated to examine how emerging neurodiversity research, trends toward greater instructional personalization, and rapidly evolving virtual learning tools have affected the use of MI theory to enhance student achievement. It also includes brand-new lesson plans aligned to nationwide standards and a revised list of resources for further study.</p></p><p><p><b>Thomas Armstrong</b> is the executive director of the American Institute for Learning and Human Development and the author of six other books published by ASCD, including <em>The Power of the Adolescent Brain: Strategies for Teaching Middle and High School Students</em> (2016), <em>Neurodiversity in the Classroom: Strength-Based Strategies to Help Students with Special Needs Succeed in School and Life</em> (2014), <em>The Best Schools: How Human Development Research Should Inform Educational Practice</em> (2006), <em>The Multiple Intelligences of Reading and Writing</em> (2003), <em>Awakening Genius in the Classroom</em> (1998), and <em>ADD/ADHD Alternatives in the Classroom</em> (1999), along with numerous trade books.

Their music at night was loud, and I liked it; it was not music I knew. Mornings, I picked up the empties they had lobbed across the hedge, Coronas with the limes wedged inside, and pitched them back over. We had not introduced ourselves these three months.</p><p>Between our houses a tall privet hedge is backed by white pine for privacy in winter. The day I heard the voice of a woman not the wife, I went out back to a spot more heavily planted but with a break I could just see through. Now it was the man who was talking, or trying to -- he started to say things he could not seem to finish. I watched the woman do something memorable to him with her mouth. Then the man pulled her up from where she had been kneeling. He said, "Maybe you're just hungry. Maybe we should get you something to eat."</p><p>The woman had a nimble laugh.</p><p>The man said, "Paris is where you and I should go."</p><p>The woman asked what was wrong with here. She said, "I like a beach town."</p><p>I wanted to phone the wife's office in the city and hear what she would sound like if she answered. I had no fellow feeling; all she had ever said to me was couldn't I mow my lawn later in the day. It was noon when she asked. I told her the village bylaws disallow mowing before seven-thirty, and that I had waited until nine. A gardener, hired by my neighbor, cared for their yard. But still I was sure they were neglecting my neighbor's orchids. All summer long I had watched for the renters to leave the house together so that I could let myself in with the key from the shelf in the shed and test the soil and water the orchids.</p><p>The woman who did not want to go to Paris said that she had to leave. "But I don't want you to leave," the man said, and she said, "Think of the kiss at the door."</p><p>Nobody thinks about the way sound carries across water. Even the water in a swimming pool. A week later, when her husband was away, the wife had friends to lunch by the pool. I didn't have to hide to listen; I was in view if they had cared to look, pulling weeds in the raspberry canes.</p><p>The women told the wife it was an opportunity for her. They said, "Fair is fair," and to do those things she might not otherwise have done. "No regrets," they said, "if you are even the type of person who is given to regret, if you even have that type of wistful temperament to begin with."</p><p>The women said, "We are not unintelligent; we just let passion prevail." They said, "Who would deny that we have all had these feelings?"</p><p>The women told the wife she would not feel this way forever. "You will feel worse, however, before you feel better, and that is just the way it always is."</p><p>The women advised long walks. They told the wife to watch the sun rise and set, to look for solace in the natural world, though they admitted there was no comfort to be found in the world and they would all be fools to expect it.</p><p>The weekend the couple next door had moved in -- their rental began on Memorial Day -- I heard them place a bet on the moon. She said waxing, he said waning. Days later, the moon nearly full in the night sky, I listened for the woman to tell her husband she had won, knowing they had not named the terms of the bet, and that the woman next door would collect nothing.</p><p><i>The Dog of the Marriage</i> copyright � 2005 by Amy Hempel</p><p></p></p><h2>The Sanford Meisner Approach: An Actor&#39;s Workbook (A Career Development Book)</h2><p>You can now experience the same training studied by some of out finest actors, including: Robert Duvall, Joanne Woodward, Diane Keaton, Jeff Goldblum, Mary Steenburgen, Gregory Peck, Jon Voight, Eli Wallach and many others. <p>With a foreword by Academy Award Winner and theatre legend, Horton Foote, this inspiring new book will strengthen in you the most essential and vital skills of great acting!

He is also on staff at the University of Washington where he teaches Master Classes in the Meisner Work, while continuing his own acting career. Larry is a past winner of the Warner Bros. Filmmaker of the Year Award for his film, Flight in Masquerade, and has also been busy directing for the stage. Larry is a graduate of the Neighborhood Playhouse School of Theater in New York City where he studied with master acting teacher, Sanford Meisner.The term Meisner Technique is known to almost any current student of acting. Sanford Meisner, one of the founding members of The Group Theater in 1931, found fault with the internalized Stanislavsky approach that prevailed at the time. Meisner believed that by reacting to the other people on stage, an actor's performance would be more honest and, therefore, more interesting for the audience. Here, Silverberg, who was a student of the master teacher, presents a workbook for actors that will prove useful, regardless of how familiar the reader is with Meisner's methods. Silverberg's writing is concise and insightful throughout and makes the technique accessible to any committed student. However, his unbridled enthusiasm and 12 step-type rhetoric may distract some readers. Also, it should be noted that the exercises in this book are for three or more people and will hence find their best use in acting workshops. Still, given the lack of materials focusing on this important technique, this work is recommended for large theater collections in public and academic libraries.?Douglas McClemont, New York<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Practical SQL: A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Storytelling with Data</h2><p><i>Practical SQL</i> is an approachable and fast-paced guide to SQL (Structured Query Language), the standard programming language for defining, organizing, and exploring data in relational databases.

The wealth of classroom examples based on actual practice convincingly refutes the argument, reflected in much current practice, that EL and low-income students are incapable of benefiting from an intellectually challenging, inquiry-based curriculum.</em></p> <strong>-Jim Cummins</strong> University of Toronto Deep understanding, critical thinking, subject knowledge, and control of academic literacy are goals we have for all our students. The challenge for teachers is to find a way of teaching that helps everyone, including English learners, to reach these high expectations. In <em>English Learners, Academic Literacy, and Thinking</em><em>,</em> Pauline Gibbons presents an action-oriented approach that gives English learners high-level support to match our high expectations. Focusing on the middle grades of school, she shows how to plan rigorous, literacy-oriented, content-based instruction and illustrates what a high-challenge, high-support curriculum looks like in practice. Gibbons (author of <em>Scaffolding Language, Scaffolding Learning</em>) presents and discusses in detail five broad areas that enable English learners to participate in high-quality learning across the curriculum: <ul> <li>engaging deeply with intellectual contexts </li> <li>developing academic literacy </li> <li>employing reading strategies and improving comprehension </li> <li>gaining writing independence and learning content-area genres </li> <li>using classroom talk to make sense of new concepts and as a bridge to writing. </li> </ul> Based on these areas she then presents guidelines on designing long-term, high-quality instruction that simultaneously provides explicit scaffolding for English learners. Gibbons makes these guidelines an instructional reality through dozens of examples of rich activities and tasks that can be used across the curriculum and that support the learning of all students. <em>English Learners, Academic Literacy, and Thinking</em> supports teachers with doable plans for instruction, reflection questions for individual or group study together, and suggestions for further reading.

Kurt Giidel maintained, and offered detailed proof, that in any arithmetic system, even in elementary parts of arithmetic, there are propositions which cannot be proved or disproved within the system. It is thus uncertain that the basic axioms of arithmetic will not give rise to contradictions. The repercussions of this discovery are still being felt and debated in 20th-century mathematics.<br>The present volume reprints the first English translation of Giidel's far-reaching work. Not only does it make the argument more intelligible, but the introduction contributed by Professor R. B. Braithwaite (Cambridge University}, an excellent work of scholarship in its own right, illuminates it by paraphrasing the major part of the argument.<br>This Dover edition thus makes widely available a superb edition of a classic work of original thought, one that will be of profound interest to mathematicians, logicians and anyone interested in the history of attempts to establish axioms that would provide a rigorous basis for all mathematics.

Run by the same powerful Virginia family for generations, it was also the center of life in Bassett, Virginia. But beginning in the 1980s, the first waves of Asian competition hit, and ultimately Bassett was forced to send its production overseas.<br><br>One man fought back: John Bassett III, a shrewd and determined third-generation factory man, now chairman of Vaughan-Bassett Furniture Co, which employs more than 700 Virginians and has sales of more than $90 million. In FACTORY MAN, Beth Macy brings to life Bassett's deeply personal furniture and family story, along with a host of characters from an industry that was as cutthroat as it was colorful. As she shows how he uses legal maneuvers, factory efficiencies, and sheer grit and cunning to save hundreds of jobs, she also reveals the truth about modern industry in America.<strong></strong></p><p><b>Beth Macy</b> writes about outsiders and underdogs.

She loved her husband, renowned psychic August Ransom, but the media frenzy that followed his murder sapped what little strength she had left. Now, after dinner with friends, strolling along San Francisco's Pier 39, she realizes that she's happy. Standing at the railing, she savors the sounds around her-tourists, seals on a barge-and for a moment enjoys the sheer normalcy of it all. And then it comes to an end.&nbsp;<br><br> Out of nowhere she's approached by a respectable-looking man who distracts her with conversation before violently attacking her and throwing her the railing. If it hadn't been for Special Agent Cheney Stone, out to stretch his legs between courses at a local restaurant, Julia would have vanished into the bay's murky depths.

With the help of agents Dillon Savich and Lacey Sherlock, whose San Francisco connections prove essential in unlocking the mystery behind Charlotte Pallack's identity as well as the forces behind Julia Ransom's attempted murder, Sheriff Noble and Agent Stone push deep into a complex world of psychics and poseurs.

It was a magnificent and meandering road that enticed millions of newly motoring Americans to hop into their Model Ts and explore the fading frontier. The Lincoln Highway. It was the road of Gettysburg, Pretty Boy Floyd, Notre Dame, the Great Salt Lake, and the Gold Rush Trail. Once a symbol of limitless potential, it is now undergoing (as Route 66 did twenty years ago) a miraculous revival. With hundreds of new and rare photographs provided by two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Michael S. Williamson, this ode to a bygone era guides us across the true spine of the country, exploring vintage diners, Art Deco buildings, and funky roadside attractions, all waiting to be discovered. 300 color illustrations</p><p><p><strong>Michael Wallis</strong>, the best-selling author of <em>Route 66</em> and <em>Billy the Kid</em>, has published eighteen books and won numerous honors and awards. He is a popular public speaker and a highly acclaimed voice actor. He lives in Tulsa, Oklahoma.</p><p><strong>Michael S. Williamson</strong>, a photographer for the <em>Washington Post</em>, won a Pulitzer Prize for <em>And the Children After Them</em> and another for his war photography in Kosovo.</p>One look at the retro artwork on the cover of this travel tome will tell you what's in store for you&#x2014;a visit down memory lane the length of the U.S. Following the 3,000-mile Lincoln Highway&#x2014;much of it has been replaced or renamed&#x2014;from New York City's Times Square to San Francisco Bay, Wallis (<i>Route 66: The Mother Road</i>) expertly captures the oft-forgotten and offbeat sights and tales of an America bypassed by superhighways. Most every town, restaurant, mom-and-pop store the author encounters along The Main Street Across America has seen better days, but Wallis still takes the time to celebrate their classic architecture and down-home recipes. With an eye for details and a gift for storytelling, he moves just as smoothly between the role of tour guide and yarn spinner as he does between the road's history and its current incarnation. The juxtaposition between old and new is further underlined by the presentation of classic images and new photographs by Williamson. With a chapter dedicated to each of the 13 states that the highway passes through, this book will delight those looking to uncover their local roots as well as adventurers yearning for that American rite of passage&#x2014;a cross-country road trip. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Accompanied by striking photographs and brief, straightforward instructions, these thematic matrices show how simple changes in preparation and ingredient swaps in a master recipe can yield dishes that are each completely different from the original, and equally delicious. <br><br>In <i>Mark Bittman&#x2019;s Kitchen Matrix</i>, Mark&#x2019;s matrices come together to create a collection of over 400 flexible recipes covering vegetables, fruits, meats and chicken, and even desserts. Whether you're cooking up soup (creamy, brothy, earthy, or hearty), freezing ice pops (in fruity, savory, creamy, or boozy varieties), or preparing asparagus (steamed, roasted, stir-fried, or grilled)<i>,</i> following<i> </i>Mark&#x2019;s approach to culinary improvisation will deliver stand-out results.</p><p><b>Mark Bittman</b>&nbsp;has had a uniquely successful career in cookbooks and food journalism. He&#x2019;s written more than a dozen books, including the now-classic <i>How to Cook Everything</i> and the bestselling <i>VB6</i> (<i>Vegan Before 6</i>), which defined a new style of American eating. His 13-year New York <i>Times </i>column &#x201c;The Minimalist&#x201d; was among the most popular in the paper, and he just completed a five-year run on the OpEd pages of the <i>Times, </i>where he was the first (and most influential) weekly columnist tackling food issues for a major media outlet.INTRODUCTION<br><br>For years I&#x2019;ve said, &#x201c;If you can cook 10 recipes, you can cook 10,000,&#x201d; and while I&#x2019;ve always felt it was true, I&#x2019;ve never believed it more strongly than I do right now. Writing this book has convinced me all over again that from simple recipes spring nearly endless possibilities.&nbsp;<br><br>Real home cooking, to borrow an old but apt clich�, is a marathon, not a sprint. It&#x2019;s something you do day to day, week to week, season to season, year to year, forever. Most of us who cook on a regular basis don&#x2019;t constantly come up with brilliant and innovative dishes&#x2014; I&#x2019;d probably be out of ideas in a month&#x2014;nor do we slavishly follow recipes to the letter; I&#x2019;d be bored in a week. Instead, we stake out a sweet spot somewhere in the middle; we learn how to cook a handful of basic dishes&#x2014;salad and vinaigrette, tomato sauce, or soup, for instance&#x2014;and what to do with everyday ingredients, like chicken breasts, shrimp, or potatoes. As soon as we&#x2019;re comfortable with core recipes and techniques we begin to improvise, swapping cilantro for parsley, say, or braising in coconut milk instead of wine, or grilling instead of broiling. We embrace the small but meaningful variations that can transform the identity of a dish, make an old favorite taste like a new creation, and turn a modest repertoire of recipes into a lifetime of wonderful meals.<br><br>This book showcases and encourages the kind of creativity and flexibility that make daily cooking not just doable but also pleasurable. And it takes little more than a glance at the chapters here&#x2014; &#x201c;Apples, 12 Ways,&#x201d; &#x201c;Slaw, 8 Ways,&#x201d; &#x201c;Leg of Lamb, 3 Ways&#x201d;&#x2014;you get the idea: to figure out my fundamental approach, pick an ingredient or a dish and see just how&nbsp;many things you can do with it. The result is a collection that looks quite different from anything I&#x2019;ve done before, and thanks to the stunning photography, more beautiful. The recipes come in multiple guises: some are conventional with ingredient lists and steps; others are more radical with directions scarcely longer than a tweet. Many are meant to facilitate improvisation in the kitchen, catering to all sorts of cooking styles and preferences.&nbsp;<br><br>Whether you like to stick to the script or cook off the cuff, undertake all-day projects or bang out fast weeknight meals, plan a detailed menu or shop first and ask questions later, there is something here for you. With this combination of recipes, art, and text I hope to depict as richly and inventively as I can just how infinitely gratifying cooking can be.&nbsp;<br><br>GROUND RULES <br>1.

Since then she has spent months on end taking walkabouts in the wild, eating nothing but what she forages, and has become a wild-foods advocate, community activist, gardener, and chef, teaching and presenting internationally about foraging and the healthful lifestyle it promotes.&nbsp;<br> <br> Katrina Blair&#x2019;s philosophy in <em>The Wild Wisdom of Weeds</em>&nbsp;is sobering, realistic, and ultimately optimistic. If we can open our eyes to see the wisdom found in these weeds right under our noses, instead of trying to eradicate an &#x201c;invasive,&#x201d; we will achieve true food security. <em>The Wild Wisdom of Weeds</em> is about healing ourselves both in body and in spirit, in an age where technology, commodity agriculture, and processed foods dictate the terms of our intelligence. But if we can become familiar with these thirteen edible survival weeds found all over the world, we will never go hungry, and we will become closer to our own wild human instincts&#x2015;all the while enjoying the freshest, wildest, and most nutritious food there is. For free!<br> <br> The thirteen plants found growing in every region across the world are: dandelion, mallow, purslane, plantain, thistle, amaranth, dock, mustard, grass, chickweed, clover, lambsquarter, and knotweed.&nbsp; These special plants contribute to the regeneration of the earth while supporting the survival of our human species; they grow everywhere where human civilization exists, from the hottest deserts to the Arctic Circle, following the path of human disturbance. Indeed, the more humans disturb the earth and put our food supply at risk, the more these thirteen plants proliferate. It&#x2019;s a survival plan for the ages.<br> <br> Including over one hundred unique recipes, Katrina Blair&#x2019;s book teaches us how to prepare these wild plants from root to seed in soups, salads, slaws, crackers, pestos, seed breads, and seed butters; cereals, green powders, sauerkrauts, smoothies, and milks; first-aid concoctions such as tinctures, teas, salves, and soothers; self-care/beauty products including shampoo, mouthwash, toothpaste (and brush), face masks; and a lot more. Whether readers are based at home or traveling, this book aims to empower individuals to maintain a state of optimal health with minimal cost and effort.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Katrina Blair began studying wild plants in her teens, when she camped out alone for a summer with the intention of eating primarily wild foods.

Many are frequently classified as noxious or invasive, but Blair encourages us to see them not as enemies to be eradicated but as allies to nourish body and spirit. Each profile includes botanical and common names, a description, photos, history, edible and medicinal uses, and recipes.

Moral education has always been the domain of religion, and Linda Kavelin Popov has culled 52 universal virtues from the world's religions, one for each week of the year. The resulting <i>Family Values Guide</i> is a workbook for the moral education of children that transcends differences of religion or culture. Each week, the book suggests, a family should gather to discuss a different virtue from the book, such as love, generosity, or patience, and the parents then emphasize the virtue for the following days, capitalizing on appropriate moments for education. Contrary to some pop psychology authors, Popov insists that reasonable boundaries be established and maintained for children and that appropriate punishment be meted out when boundaries are crossed. Psychotherapist and president of the Family Values Project, Popov sees the language of values as the key to recognizing their importance in social interaction, and encourages parents to add other values to their own list.The most important job parents have is to pass basic virtues on to their children, and this invaluable book is designed to help make that job a little easier.

Their goal: to bring their individual egos into a state of superhuman power and awareness in which they could act "magically" on the world.

Its title &#x2014; like Catch-22 and Fahrenheit 451 &#x2014; has become a part of America's cultural vocabulary. Tom Rath doesn't want anything extraordinary out of life: just a decent home, enough money to support his family, and a career that won't crush his spirit. After returning from World War II, he takes a PR job at a television network. It is inane, dehumanizing work. But when a series of personal crises force him to reexamine his priorities &#x2014; and take responsibility for his past &#x2014; he is finally moved to carve out an identity for himself. This is Sloan Wilson's searing indictment of a society that had just begun to lose touch with its citizens.

We see the soldiers debate leaders and strategy in open assembly; we see them falling on their knees in superstitious fear; we see them planning a piratical colony on barbarian land.

Vicious mutilation, a penchant for arcane symbols, and a seemingly random choice of victim are his most distinctive peculiarities. Detective Inspector Oskar Rheinhardt summons a young disciple of Freud - his friend Dr. Max Liebermann &#x2014; to assist him with the case. The investigation draws them into the sphere of Vienna&#x2019;s secret societies &#x2014; a murky underworld of German literary scholars, race theorists, and scientists inspired by the new evolutionary theories coming out of England. At first, the killer&#x2019;s mind seems impenetrable &#x2014; his behaviour and cryptic clues impervious to psychoanalytic interpretation; however, gradually, it becomes apparent that an extraordinary and shocking rationale underlies his actions. . . . <br> <br> Against this backdrop of mystery and terror, Liebermann struggles with his own demons. The treatment of a patient suffering from paranoia erotica (a delusion of love) and his own fascination with the enigmatic Englishwoman Amelia Lydgate raises doubts concerning the propriety of his imminent marriage.

Any disadvantage he suffered because of his lack of height was amply compensated for by his sharp eye and astonishing speed. <br>Liebermann successfully deflected the foil&#x2019;s thrust but lost his balance. He was unable to produce a counterattack and his opponent advanced yet again. The tip of the Italian&#x2019;s foil came perilously close to the protective quilting over Liebermann&#x2019;s heart. Recovering his footing, Liebermann chose to make a <i>pass&#x17d;</i>&#x2013;darting behind the Italian and taking a few steps backward. A trickle of sweat slid down his hot cheek. The Italian shrugged and walked away, flexing his foil in a gesture of indifference. After a few paces he swung around and adopted the preparatory stance, his chin tilted upward in an attitude of arrogance. Liebermann edged forward. <br>The Italian seemed to relax, his foil wilting a little in an apparently weaker grip. Liebermann noticed the subtle change and struck. A violent brassy clang was followed by the shriek of scraping metal: the Italian&#x2019;s foil yielded, offering no resistance. Liebermann congratulated himself, believing that he had taken his opponent by surprise&#x2013;but the concession was merely tactical. The Italian&#x2019;s blade deftly flicked around Liebermann&#x2019;s, displacing it with a powerful grazing action, and, once again, the tip of his opponent&#x2019;s foil effortlessly penetrated Liebermann&#x2019;s defenses. Liebermann retreated, executing a series of deflective maneuvers that barely contained the Italian&#x2019;s renewed fierce attack. <br>{ <i>3 } </i><br><i>Frank Tallis </i><br>They circled each other, occasionally touching blades in glancing contact. <br>&#x201c;You should have anticipated my <i>froissement, </i>Herr Doctor,&#x201d; said the Italian gruffly. He tapped his temple and added: &#x201c;Think, Herr Doctor! If you do not think, all is lost.&#x201d; <br>Liebermann examined the blank oval of Signore Barbasetti&#x2019;s mask, eager to observe some mark of humanity&#x2013;a conciliatory expression or the glimmer of a smile, perhaps. The mesh, however, was impenetrable. <br>Their foils clashed again&#x2013;blades flashing in a shaft of early-morning sunlight. A swarm of lazy dust motes was sucked into a miniature cyclone of displaced air. <br>Barbasetti produced a feint, switching from one line of attack to another, forcing Liebermann to draw back. However, the young doctor retained his composure and made a move that he intended should fail, thus provoking a predictable and powerful thrust from Barbasetti. Liebermann dodged and struck the forte of the Italian&#x2019;s foil as he stumbled past&#x2013;Barbasetti almost lost his grip. <br>&#x201c;Bravo, Herr Doctor,&#x201d; Barbasetti said, and laughed. &#x201c;An excellent <i>falso</i>!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thank you, signor.&#x201d; <br>Barbasetti came to a halt and lifted his blade, scrutinizing it closely. &#x201c;Please excuse me, Herr Doctor.&#x201d; <br>Barbasetti walked to the other side of the drill hall and pressed the hilt of his foil against the surface of a battered wooden table. He then hung a small iron weight from the tip and watched the metal blade bend. Its gentle curvature elicited an equivocal grunt from the watchful Italian. <br>&#x201c;Is everything all right, signor?&#x201d; Liebermann asked. <br>&#x201c;Yes, I think so,&#x201d; Barbasetti replied. The Italian raised himself up, marched back, and warned his student: <i>&#x201c;En garde.&#x201d; </i><br>{ <i>4 } </i><br><i>Vienna Blood </i><br>Immediately they were engaged, Liebermann&#x2019;s foil sliding along his opponent&#x2019;s blade until the hand guards crashed together. The fencing master pushed and Liebermann was thrown back: he landed awkwardly, but was nevertheless able to execute an impressive flying parry. <br>Barbasetti disengaged. &#x201c;Much better.&#x201d; <br>Liebermann noticed that the button at the end of his foil was trembling&#x2013;he was feeling tired. After his lesson, he would have coffee and croissants in the little coffeehouse close to the Anatomical Institute. He would need something in his stomach to keep him going. . . . <br><i>&#x201c;En garde!&#x201d;</i>Barbasetti barked again. The Italian had noticed that his student&#x2019;s mind had begun to wander. Liebermann was astonished by the fencing master&#x2019;s insight. <br>Again their blades connected, and the plangent clatter of contending steel filled the hall. Liebermann thought that Signore Barbasetti was tiring too. His pace had slackened slightly and his movements were less balletic. The Italian deflected Liebermann&#x2019;s lunge, but failed to resume his guard. Observing the exposed chest protector, Liebermann recognized a rare opportunity. Excited by the prospect of victory, he raised his foil, ready to strike. <br>But the blow was never delivered. <br>His body froze, paralyzed by the inexplicable pressure that he felt against his heart. Dropping his gaze, he contemplated the tip of Signore Barbasetti&#x2019;s foil, which had found its home precisely above the intercostal space separating ribs five and six. <br>Barbasetti pushed, and the cold steel curved upward. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; said Liebermann. <br>&#x201c;You were not concentrating, Herr Doctor,&#x201d; said the Italian. &#x201c;Such an error would certainly lose you a competition . . . and of course, in some circumstances, your life.&#x201d; <br>{ <i>5} </i><br><i>Frank Tallis </i><br>Barbasetti lowered his foil and then raised it in salute. <br>Liebermann returned the gesture politely. In spite of the fencing master&#x2019;s dramatic declaration, the young doctor was ashamed to find that he was still thinking of the little coffeehouse near the Anatomical Institute: crisp flakes of buttery pastry, a pot of plum jam, and a cup of very strong black coffee. <br>{ <i>6} </i></p><h2>Deck the Hallways (A Fixer-Upper Mystery)</h2><p><b>In the fourth novel in the <i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling Fixer-Upper Mystery series, contractor Shannon Hammer must restore the Christmas spirit by clearing her father's name...<br><br>Don't miss&nbsp;the&nbsp;Hallmark Movies &amp; Mystery Originals starring Jewel, based on the Fixer-Upper Mystery series!</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Even during the holidays, Shannon is more spackle than sparkle, which is why she leaps at the chance to transform a grand old Victorian mansion into ten charming apartments for homeless families.

Wearing a green-and-red-striped housecoat and a red wool hat with reindeer antlers, she stood in her yard watering her colorful flower beds.<br><br>We were two weeks into December and Mrs. Higgins's front yard was festooned with rows of dancing candy canes and shimmery swirling snowflakes. A glow-in-the-dark, six-foot-tall blow-up Santa Claus was surrounded by eight large plastic reindeer. On her wide front porch was a life-sized animatronic Snow White and her seven dwarves frolicking around a twinkling Christmas tree.<br><br>Overnight, bright holiday lights had been strung up and down across her roof and around each window and the front door. I suspected her sons-in-law had worked all night and I was touched by their kindness, knowing how much their mother-in-law loved the holiday. I also knew from experience that these lights would remain lit twenty-four hours a day into the New Year.<br><br>For the next few weeks, astronauts traveling in space would wonder and worry about a strange, radiant glow emanating from northern California, but we locals knew it was only Mrs. Higgins's holiday lights. The woman knew how to do Christmas right-and at the same time made all her neighbors, including me, look like Ebenezer in comparison.<br><br>My lights were always the last in the neighborhood to go up and, while I had many treasured ornaments from childhood, my collection of decorations were, comparatively speaking, sadly lacking. Still, I love Christmas and any day now I would spring into full holiday mode, but I wasn't quite feeling the spirit yet. Nevertheless, I smiled and rolled down my window. "Good morning, Mrs. Higgins. You're out early this morning."<br><br>"These roses aren't going to water themselves, little missy."<br><br>She had a point.<br><br>"You have a good day," I said, and she gave me an absent wave as I raised the window and drove off down the street. Mrs. Higgins grew dottier every year, but she was still a good neighbor despite her tendency toward garish holiday overkill.<br><br>Honestly I enjoyed Christmas as much as anyone and always looked forward to buying a tree and decorating my house for the season. But was it too much to ask for a few weeks of quiet calm after struggling through the frenzied overindulgence of Thanksgiving celebrations? Did we have to gear up for the next round of hectic merriment so soon?<br><br>"Oh, lighten up," I muttered. I was already sick of my grouchy, anti-holiday attitude and it was barely eight in the morning. The truth was, I hadn't slept well the night before and now I was late for work. It didn't help that my personal life was in shambles, but that was something I refused to dwell on. But if this cranky mood went unchecked, I was likely to turn into what my crew would call The Boss from, well, you know where. In other words, a really bad boss. And that just wasn't me.<br><br>With that thought in mind, I drove to my favorite coffee bar and bought the latte that would magically transform me into a reasonable human being.<br><br>By the time I arrived at the job site ten minutes later, I was surprised to hear myself humming along to a Christmas carol on the radio. Thanks to James Taylor's magically mellow version of "Deck the Halls," and the wonders of caffeine and steamed milk, I was feeling better. It was like a mini-Christmas miracle, I thought, as I pulled into the long driveway and parked my truck by the side of the six-car garage behind the old Forester mansion.<br><br>"Made it," I said aloud, and breathed a sigh of relief. My humor was still somewhat intact and I was ready to get started. I slid down from the cab, zipped up my quilted vest, reached for my knit cap and my latte, and locked the door.<br><br>I walked to the back of the truck and paused for a moment to gaze up at Forester House, officially the biggest Victorian home in Lighthouse Cove. That was saying a lot, because our town was known for its truly grand Victorian mansions. But this one was enormous. I felt a shiver skip down my arms, not from the cold-although it was close to freezing-but from gleeful anticipation. This job promised to be one of the most challenging I'd ever faced, but also one of the most fun. Either way, I was ready for it.<br><br>Forester House was a true original. One of the oldest homes in the area, it was built in 1867 in the classic Queen Anne style. But though it followed those traditional lines with its intricately detailed tower rising three stories at the northeast corner, its plethora of gables and mismatched window sizes and shapes, and its four tall chimneys, Forester House was anything but feminine and frilly. Instead, it had a dark, gothic vibe made even more intense by thick, sage green sandstone walls and wildly asymmetrical rooflines covered in dark, heavy tiles instead of the traditional lighter weight composite shingles. Enormous dormers with Tudor detailing rose to encompass three stories. A porte cochere on the east side of the house allowed visitors to be dropped off and step directly onto the veranda that wrapped around three sides of the home and was wide enough to be used as an outdoor room in good weather.<br><br>Originally the home had been built to accommodate Mr. Forester's wealthy summer guests who'd driven up from San Francisco and stayed for months at a time, so he had added balconies onto all six of the large bedrooms on the second floor. The attic, too, featured several smaller terraces tucked under the sturdy, tile-shingled eaves.<br><br>The stones used to build Forester House had not been cut smoothly but instead had been left rough and uneven. Those details did nothing to make the mansion unsightly; on the contrary, the place was a strapping fortress of a home that exuded raw power and strength. It was imposing and even a bit intimidating (although I would never utter that word out loud).<br><br>Any remaining Forester family members had long since died or moved away, and after years of neglect the house had gone into foreclosure. It was now owned by the Lighthouse Cove Bank and Trust, a respected and reliable local institution. Half the people in town had accounts at Lighthouse B&amp;T, including me and my father and most of my friends so everyone was thrilled when the bank decided to donate the home to the town's favorite charity, Holiday Homebuilders, instead of tearing it down and selling off small parcels of the picturesque two-acre lot.<br><br>The Holiday Homebuilders charity had been created over twenty years ago to support an annual tradition in Lighthouse Cove. Every December, nearly everyone in town came together to help build a house for a family in need. We furnished it and then decorated it for the season, right down to the bowls of Christmas candy on the tables.<br><br>Jason Walsh, who ran the charity, used to work on my dad's construction crew so he knew something about building homes. He was truly excited about refurbishing Forester House, subdividing the huge mansion into apartments in order to provide housing for fifteen lucky families. It was an unprecedented donation and the news had caused everyone in town to buzz with delight.<br><br>And I was buzzing more than anyone else because the person in charge of the entire project was me!<br><br>In addition, twelve local contractors had volunteered their services. After many meetings and discussions, I had assigned each of them a section of the mansion to transform into a separate dwelling for either a small family or a single person. Except for the unfinished third-floor attic, most of the rooms would remain single large spaces with the addition of kitchenettes and closets where needed. Local carpenters, plumbers, electricians, and painters had also volunteered their time to the cause. Six local interior decorators would work with the contractors to furnish the spaces. Since many of the families would bring very little furniture with them, it was up to us to turn these places into comfortable homes. The decorators had been working for weeks, shopping for fine quality used furniture and interesting bargains. A local mattress store was donating brand-new beds for each apartment and a nearby furniture store was filling in with everything that hadn't already been covered.<br><br>It was heartwarming to see such generosity flowing from my fellow townspeople this time of year. So with all that wonderfulness surrounding me, why hadn't I gotten into the spirit of the season yet? Why couldn't I suck up the joy and get with the program?<br><br>"There you are."<br><br>I whipped around and saw Wade Chambers, my head foreman, waving at me from the back veranda. He jogged down the steps and ran over to meet me. "Merry Christmas, Shannon."<br><br>"Hey, Wade. How's it going?" As I said the words, I scowled inwardly. What was wrong with me? I couldn't extend a happy holiday greeting to one of my oldest friends? Apparently not. I just wasn't ready. Fine. I slid my tool chest out of the truck and tried not to feel too guilty.<br><br>Wade didn't seem to notice as he rubbed his stomach. "We're on day ten of Thanksgiving leftovers. Last night was turkey pot pie."<br><br>"That sounds pretty good."<br><br>"It was, actually. I keep saying I won't have to eat for a week after eating what I did, but I continue to indulge. Ah, well." He glanced at me. "How about you?"<br><br>"About the same." I gazed up at the house. "Are you excited? Ready to finally knock this thing out of the park?"<br><br>"You bet I am." But he didn't move, just stared at me with a look of concern.<br><br>When he didn't look away, I set my tool chest down on the blacktop surface of the driveway. "You're staring and it's starting to freak me out. What's wrong?"<br><br>If anything, his concern deepened as his eyes narrowed in on me. "That was going to be my question. Is everything okay?"<br><br>I hedged a little. I guess I wasn't quite as good at hiding my odd mood as I thought I was if my own foreman could tell something was off. "Of course. Why not?"<br><br>"Come on, Shannon. First of all, you're never late for work. And second . . . I don't know. Something's going on with you." He picked up my tool chest with no effort and started to walk toward the back of the house.<br><br>Scowling, I rushed to keep up with him. "I just hate being late, that's all. I would've called but I was running around."<br><br>"Yeah? I tried to call you but there was no answer."<br><br>I pulled out my cell phone and noticed an unanswered call. "I didn't hear the phone ring."<br><br>He stopped. "Something going on I should know about? Why were you running around?"<br><br>"It's nothing." I sighed. I wasn't about to confess what was really going on with me. He wouldn't be able to keep it to himself and I would never live down the embarrassment of everyone in town knowing that my pitiful little heart was breaking. So I simply told him the truth about the morning's main activity. "Robbie ran out of the gate and took off for the beach."<br><br>Wade's eyes widened and he stopped and gripped my arm. "But you found him, right?"<br><br>"I did, thank goodness." My adorable West Highland terrier, Rob Roy, otherwise known as Robbie, had never wandered off before. I had spent fifteen distressing minutes hunting him down. Luckily all my neighbors knew who the little white dog belonged to and some of them helped me find him. The chase had set me back fifteen minutes, so that was why I was late. And why I was cranky earlier. Well, along with the aforementioned heartbreak silliness, but I was doing my best to ignore that.<br><br>"Thank God," he murmured. Wade and his kids were big Robbie fans.<br><br>"It's just not like him to run off and disappear like that," I said, moving forward toward the house. "I was terrified. I think Mrs. Higgins's decorations set him off. They blink and light up the sky all night long. Maybe the holidays are getting to him as much as they're getting to me."<br><br>He shot me a sideways glance. "But you've always loved the holidays. Especially Christmas."<br><br>I waved away his words. "I know, I know. I love Christmas, blah blah blah."<br><br>He laughed. "Yeah, you're really full of the old holiday spirit."<br><br>"Sorry." I shook my head and shoulders like a wet dog, hoping I could fling away this funky feeling. "Don't worry, I'll get into the swing of things." I hoped so, anyway. With a frown, I pressed my hand to my forehead. "Maybe I'm coming down with something."<br><br>"You'd better not be. This job's going to wind up being a twenty-four-seven gig, so we've all got to stay in top shape."<br><br>I grinned. "Yes, boss."<br><br>But then he stopped and pointed at me. "Right there."<br><br>"What?" I demanded.<br><br>"It's like I said." His eyes narrowed as if he were studying a strange life form. "There's something else going on with you."<br><br>"No there isn't." I kept walking, nipping that particular conversation thread in the bud.<br><br>We reached the house and climbed the steps up to the veranda. As I headed for the door, Wade grabbed my arm. "Shannon, wait. I'm sorry I was being nosy."<br><br>"You were being a friend." I smiled at him. "You never have to apologize for that."<br><br>"I appreciate it." His own smile faded. "I had a reason for calling you earlier. I wanted to tell you about Frank. He's not going to be here."<br><br>"Why not?" I stared up at him. "Is he okay? What happened?" Frank was one of my favorite contractors and a great guy.<br><br>Wade scowled. "His wife's company just transferred her to San Diego. Frank is thrilled. He's packing up their house and moving next week."<br><br>"Oh no! That's terrible." I winced. "I mean, that's great for them. But now we need another contractor."<br><br>"I know."<br><br>He set down my tool chest and we both pulled our tablets out of our bags. I swept my finger across the screen. "Shoot. I had him in charge of overseeing all the work on the third floor attic. We'll have to reorganize the team leaders."<br><br>"Yeah."<br><br>My shoulders slumped as I slid the tablet into its case. "He didn't even call to say good-bye."<br><br>"Probably couldn't bear to hear the disappointment in your voice."<br><br>I cracked a reluctant smile. "You mean he was too chicken to call."<br><br>"That's what I told him." He leaned against the wall. "Seriously, though, it's a real drag to lose him."</p><h2>Everyday Fashions of the Forties As Pictured in Sears Catalogs (Dover Fashion and Costumes)</h2><p><p>Few publications illustrate so comprehensively what American men, women, and children wore in the 1940s than the Sears catalogs of those years, when the company's fashions typified the tastes of the American mainstream.

After a few minutes, my hair, my eyelashes, even the blouse of my school uniform are damp from the heat and humidity, and I&#x2019;m bathed in a moist film that smells vaguely of chlorine.<br>Far below my feet, gentle ripples disrupt the pale blue surface of the water. A constant stream of tiny bubbles rises from the diving well; I can&#x2019;t see the bottom. The ceiling is made of glass and is very high. I sit here, halfway up the bleachers, as if suspended in midair.<br>Jun is walking out on the ten-meter board. He&#x2019;s wearing the rust-colored swimsuit I saw yesterday on the drying rack outside the window of his room. When he reaches the end of the board, he turns slowly; then, facing away from the water, he aligns his heels. Every muscle in his body is tensed, as if he were holding his breath. The line of muscle from his ankle to his thigh has the cold elegance of a bronze statue.<br>Sometimes I wish I could describe how wonderful I feel in those few seconds from the time he spreads his arms above his head, as if trying to grab hold of something, to the instant he vanishes into the water. But I can never find the right words. Perhaps it&#x2019;s because he&#x2019;s falling through time, to a place where words can never reach.<br>&#x201c;Inward two-and-a-half in the tuck position,&#x201d; I murmur.<br>He misses the dive. His chest hits the water with a smack and sends up a great spray of white.<br>But I enjoy it just the same, whether he misses a dive or hits it perfectly with no splash. So I never sit here hoping for a good dive, and I am never disappointed by a bad one. Jun&#x2019;s graceful body cuts through these childish emotions to reach the deepest place inside me.<br>He reappears out of the foam, the rippling surface of the water gathering up like a veil around his shoulders; and he swims slowly toward the side of the pool.<br>I&#x2019;ve seen pictures from underwater cameras. The frame is completely filled with deep blue water, and then the diver shoots down, only to turn at the bottom and kick off back toward the surface. This underwater pivot is even more beautiful than the dive itself: the ankles and hands slice through the water majestically, and the body is completely enclosed in the purity of the pool. When the women dive, their hair flutters underwater as though lifted in a breeze, and they all look so peaceful, like children doing deep-breathing exercises.<br>One after the other, the divers come slipping into the water, making their graceful arcs in front of the camera. I would like them to move more slowly, to stay longer, but after a few seconds their heads appear again above the surface.<br>Does Jun let his body float free at the bottom of the pool, like a fetus in its mother&#x2019;s womb? How I&#x2019;d love to watch him to my heart&#x2019;s content as he drifts there, utterly free.<br>I spend a lot of time on the bleachers at the edge of the diving pool. I was here yesterday and the day before, and three months ago as well. I&#x2019;m not thinking about anything or waiting for something; in fact, I don&#x2019;t seem to have any reason to be here at all. I just sit and look at Jun&#x2019;s wet body.<br>We&#x2019;ve lived under the same roof for more than ten years, and we go to the same high school, so we see each other and talk any number of times every day. But it&#x2019;s when we&#x2019;re at the pool that I feel closest to Jun&#x2014;when he&#x2019;s diving, his body nearly defenseless in only a swimsuit, twisting itself into the laid-out position, the pike, the tuck. Dressed in my neatly ironed skirt and freshly laundered blouse, I take my place in the stands and set my schoolbag at my feet. I couldn&#x2019;t reach him from here even if I tried.<br>Yet this is a special place, my personal watchtower. I alone can see him, and he comes straight to me.<br>I pass the shops near the station and turn from the main road onto the first narrow street heading south, along the tracks. The noise and bustle die away. It&#x2019;s May now, and even when I reach the station after Jun&#x2019;s practice, the warmth of the day lingers in the air.<br>After I pass the park&#x2014;little more than a sandbox and a water fountain&#x2014;the company dormitory, and the deserted maternity clinic, there&#x2019;s nothing to see but rows of houses. It takes more than twenty-five minutes to walk home, and along the way the knot of people who left the station with me unravels and fades away with the sunlight. By the end, I&#x2019;m usually alone.<br>A low hedge runs along the side of the road. It eventually gives way to trees, and then the cinder-block wall, half covered with ivy, comes into view. In the places where the ivy doesn&#x2019;t grow, the wall has turned moss green, as if the blocks themselves were living things. Then the gate, standing wide open, held back by a rusted chain that seems to prevent it from ever being closed.<br>In fact, I have never seen it closed. It&#x2019;s always open, ready to welcome anyone who comes seeking God in a moment of trouble or pain. No one is ever turned away, not even me.<br>Next to the gate is a glass-covered notice board with a neon light, and on it is posted the Thought for the Week: WHO IS MORE PRECIOUS? YOU OR YOUR BROTHER? WE ARE ALL CHILDREN OF GOD, AND YOU MUST NEVER TREAT YOUR BROTHER AS A STRANGER. Every Saturday afternoon, my father spends a long time looking through the Bible before carefully grinding ink on his stone and writing out this Thought. The smell of the ink permeates the old box where he keeps his brushes and grinding stone. He pours a few drops from the tiny water pot into the well of the stone, and then, holding the ink stick very straight, he grinds the stick into a dark liquid. Only when he finishes this long process does he finally dip his brush. Each gesture is done slowly, almost maddeningly so, as if he were performing a solemn ritual, and I am always careful to creep quietly past his door to avoid disturbing him.<br>Attracted to the neon light, countless tiny insects crawl on the notice board among my father&#x2019;s perfectly formed characters. At some point, evening has turned to night. The darkness inside the gate seems even thicker than outside, perhaps due to the dense foliage that grows within. Trees are planted at random along the wall, their branches tangled and overgrown. The front yard is covered in a thick jumble of weeds and flowers.<br>In this sea of green, two massive ginkgo trees stand out against the night sky. Every autumn, the children put on work gloves to gather the nuts. As the oldest, Jun climbs up on one of the thick branches and shakes the tree, and then the younger children run around frantically amid the hail of nuts and dried yellow leaves. Passing near the trees always makes me think of the soft skins surrounding the nuts, squashed like caterpillars on the soles of the children&#x2019;s shoes, and of the horrible odor they spread through the house.<br>To the left of the ginkgo trees is the church, and at an angle beyond, connected by a covered corridor, the building we call the Light House. This is my home.<br>The pale blue moisture I absorbed in the stands at the pool has evaporated by the time I reach here; my body is dry and hollow. And it is always the same: I can never simply come home the way other girls do. I find myself reading the Thought for the Week, passing through the gate, entering the Light House&#x2014;and something always stops me, something always seems out of place.<br>Sometimes, as I approach, the Light House appears fixed and acute, while I, by contrast, feel vague and dim. At other times, I feel almost painfully clear and sharp, while the Light House is hazy. Either way, there is always something irreconcilable between the house and me, something I can never get past.<br>This was my home. My family was here. Jun, too. I remind myself of these facts each time I surrender to the curtain of green and open the door of the Light House.<br>When I try to put my memories in some kind of order, I realize that the earliest ones are the clearest and most indelible.<br>It was a brilliant morning in early summer. Jun and I were playing by the old well in the backyard. The well had been filled in long before and a fig tree planted over it. We must have been four or five years old, so it was soon after Jun had come to live at the Light House. His mother had been a chronic alcoholic, and he had been born out of wedlock, so one of our loyal parishioners had brought him to us.<br>I had broken off a branch from the fig tree and was watching the opalescent liquid ooze from the wound. When I touched it, the sticky emission clung to my finger. I broke another branch.<br>&#x201c;Time for milky!&#x201d; I said to Jun.<br>I made him sit on my lap, and I wrapped an arm around his shoulders as I brought the branch to his lips. Nothing about Jun&#x2019;s body then hinted at the muscular form later shining in the transparent water of the pool. My arms remember only the softness of an ordinary small child. Like a baby at the breast, he pursed his lips and made little chirping sounds, even wrapping his hands around mine as if he were clutching a bottle. The milk of the fig had a bitter, earthy smell.<br>I felt myself suddenly overcome by a strange and horrible sensation. It might have been the fig milk or the softness of Jun&#x2019;s body bringing it on, but that seemed to be the beginning&#x2014;though I suppose it&#x2019;s possible this terrible feeling took hold of me even earlier, before I was even born.<br>I broke a thicker branch with more milk and smeared it against his mouth. He knit his brow and licked his lips, and at that moment the sunlight becomes intensely bright, the scene blurs to white, and my oldest memory comes to an end.<br>Since that time, I&#x2019;ve had many similar moments, and I can never hear the words &#x201c;family&#x201d; and &#x201c;home&#x201d; without feeling that they sound strange, never simply hear them and let them go. When I stop to examine them, though, the words seem hollow, seem to rattle at my f...</p></p><h2>Wayfinding: The Science and Mystery of How Humans Navigate the World</h2><p><p><b>At once far flung and intimate, a fascinating look at how finding our way make us human.</b><br><b></b><br>"A marvel of storytelling." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus</i> (Starred Review) </p><p>In this compelling narrative, O'Connor seeks out neuroscientists, anthropologists and master navigators to understand how navigation ultimately gave us our humanity. Biologists have been trying to solve the mystery of how organisms have the ability to migrate and orient with such precision&#x2015;especially since our own adventurous ancestors spread across the world without maps or instruments.

O'Connor talks to scientists studying how atrophy in the hippocampus is associated with afflictions such as impaired memory, dementia, Alzheimer&#x2019;s Disease, depression and PTSD. <br><i>Wayfinding</i> is a captivating book that charts how our species' profound capacity for exploration, memory and storytelling results in topophilia, the love of place.</p><p>"O'Connor talked to just the right people in just the right places, and her narrative is a marvel of storytelling on its own merits, erudite but lightly worn.

In an old Volvo wagon with balding tires and a broken air conditioner, they followed the black vein of highway&#x2014;first skirting the edge of Joshua Tree, where the roasted wind roared in their faces, then braving the Mojave Desert. They pushed through Arizona and New Mexico, and sailed over the Texas prairie.</p><p>Twenty-four hours ago, they crossed into Louisiana where the cotton and rice fields stretched away in a lavish patchwork of pale greens and browns, and a hundred miles after that, where the rice and cotton fields yielded to the tropical landscape of sugarcane country.</p><p>Now it was the next morning, their first full day in Saint Josephine Parish. They hadn&#x2019;t seen a house or car since they turned off the Old Spanish Trail, and the road, which crossed over the Bayou Teche, was leading them farther away from town, farther out into the country, and Charley&#x2014;who&#x2019;d never seen real sugarcane before yesterday&#x2014;thought she should have trusted her instincts; thought that if she&#x2019;d just listened to the small voice that whispered take the map, they&#x2019;d be there by now. Instead, she had listened to her grandmother, Miss Honey, with whom she and Micah now lived. &#x201c;Put that away,&#x201d; Miss Honey had said at breakfast that morning as Charley spread the map over the kitchen table. &#x201c;I know how to get there. Just let me get my purse.&#x201d; Now here they were&#x2014;Charley and Micah and Miss Honey&#x2014;wandering hopelessly, like three blind stooges, through south Louisiana&#x2019;s cane country, creeping down one ragged back road till it dead-ended in a grass-choked gulley before trying another, while the sun got hotter and the air grew soupier; burning up precious time as they searched for the turnoff that would lead Charley to her fields. She had inherited eight hundred acres of sugarcane land from her father, Ernest. For the last ten months, she had pored over more aerial photos and assessors&#x2019; maps than she cared to count, signed documents and placed phone calls. She had planned what she could from a distance. The fields Charley had thought of for almost a year were out there&#x2014;somewhere. Land she had to get ready for the harvest in October. God help us, she thought.</p><p>It was eight forty-five. Charley was supposed to meet Wayne Frasier at nine. The cup of Community Coffee, with its bitter note of chicory, had made her queasy. Maybe it was the coffee, but maybe not, Charley thought, as she remembered how her mother accused her of being a city girl and warned her not to make this move. Charley swore her mother was wrong, but now she thought maybe it was true. She was accustomed to measuring distance in freeway off-ramps, not hectares or miles, weighing things in pounds rather than bushels or tons. The only crop she had ever harvested were the Meyer lemons that hung lazily from the trees along her backyard fence. The only soil she ever tended came in bags from the Home Depot. She exhaled heavily. If she were a country girl, she thought, she could scan the horizon and know which of these godforsaken roads led to her fields. But she wasn&#x2019;t a country girl. Not even a little.</p><p>Charley turned to her window and caught a scent of Louisiana on the June breeze; the aroma of red clay, peppery as cayenne, musty as compost, and beneath it, the hint of mildew and Gulf water. She marveled at how different the landscape was from anything she&#x2019;d know back in California: the stretch of Highway 5 between Los Angeles and San Francisco with its endless miles of almond and pistachio orchards, vast stretches of orange groves whose blossoms perfumed the air on early spring mornings, rolling acres of grape vineyards, tomato and cotton fields, and of course, the uninterrupted miles of reeking cattle lots&#x2014;all of it with the spiny silhouette of the Sierra Nevada, like a promise, along the horizon. Charley imagined Los Angeles, with its traffic and smog and relentless sprawl, and beyond it, the never-ending coastline and immeasurable Pacific, ridiculously beautiful in the honeyed light of a southern California afternoon. Now the vast Pacific had been replaced by an ocean of sugarcane: waist-high stalks and slender, emerald-green leaves with tilled soil between. Cane as far as her eyes could see.</p><p>Charley glanced at Miss Honey. Dressed in a butter-yellow polyester dress belted high on her waist, ginger stockings rolled like doughnuts around her ankles, and white orthopedic sandals, she sat in the passenger seat clutching her white leather purse. Charley wanted to ask if they were getting close, but remembered how yesterday, Miss Honey scolded her for arriving three hours late. &#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s about time. You said noon,&#x201d; Miss Honey had said, standing on the top porch step. &#x201c;I started to think y&#x2019;all had changed your minds&#x201d;; how Miss Honey had flicked that purple plastic fly swatter as if it were a riding crop, and reprimanded her for cutting her hair. &#x201c;You used to have long, pretty hair,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said. &#x201c;Good hair. Now you look like a man.&#x201d;</p><p>More minutes passed. A weather-beaten farmhouse set back from the road, a cluster of small wooden shacks in the distance that looked strangely familiar. Were they driving in circles?</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Miss Honey,&#x201d; Charley said. &#x201c;But are you sure this is the right way?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m sure,&#x201d; Miss Honey said. &#x201c;If that man Frasier said your place was off the Old Spanish Trail, then this is the way. This used to be an Indian road.&#x201d;</p><p>Micah, who had been fiddling with an ancient Polaroid camera Miss Honey had given her, reached over the backseat and tapped Miss Honey&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t say Indian. It&#x2019;s Native American. Indian is offensive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, really?&#x201d; Miss Honey said without turning around. &#x201c;Do you know any Indians?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Native Americans,&#x201d; Micah corrected. &#x201c;Indians live in India.&#x201d;</p><p>Miss Honey laughed, though Charley thought it wasn&#x2019;t a laugh of delight or amusement. &#x201c;Well, the Native Americans I know like to be called Indians,&#x201d; Miss Honey said, fingering her purse strap. &#x201c;Bunch of &#x2019;em live in the woods behind my house.&#x201d; She turned to Charley. &#x201c;They built a big casino with a Mexican restaurant and a fancy steak house over in Charenton. Lights up the whole sky at night.&#x201d;</p><p>Charley nodded, and was about to suggest they go gambling sometime, feed the slots or take their chances at blackjack, when Miss Honey said, &#x201c;Nothing over there but a pack of jackals if you ask me. Jackals and sinners.&#x201d;</p><p>They drove on.</p><p>Out in the fields, a gaggle of laborers followed doggedly behind a tractor. Up ahead, the remnants of an old sugar mill&#x2014;brick smokestacks, rusted corrugated siding, dust-caked windows&#x2014;loomed over the cane.</p><p>Miss Honey dabbed her neck with a wad of tissue and smoothed her gray candy curls. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stand riding in a car with no air-conditioning.&#x201d;</p><p>Charley nodded and added tune-up to the list of chores she&#x2019;d tackle as soon as they got back to Miss Honey&#x2019;s and she was able to unpack.</p><p>&#x201c;Baby,&#x201d; Miss Honey said, &#x201c;look in that cooler and hand me a Coke.&#x201d; She raised her hand, palm side up, to her shoulder. Charley recognized the gesture. Her father held his hands the same way, right down to the fingers curved as though he were gripping a ball. &#x201c;Hand me a boiled egg,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say during their cross-country drives to Saint Josephine when she was a girl. Or, &#x201c;Reach in there and give me a couple of those cookies,&#x201d; and she&#x2019;d root around in the cooler he&#x2019;d packed until she found what he asked for, excited to put just the right thing in her daddy&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>Micah handed a bottle of Coke over the seat and Miss Honey twisted off the cap. She drew a small square packet from her purse, tore it open, and poured the contents&#x2014;a tablespoon of powder the color and consistency of cornstarch&#x2014;into the bottle. She swirled the mixture until a head of hissing foam rose along the glass.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Micah asked.</p><p>Miss Honey took a swig. &#x201c;Stanback. I take it for my headaches.&#x201d; </p><p>Charley was no chemist, but she considered the properties of Coke: water, corn syrup, a healthy dose of caffeine, and guessed at the Stanback: aspirin for the pain, a little sugar to cut the bitterness, some type of amphetamine for an extra boost, and figured the combination would give quite a buzz. She wondered, as Miss Honey nursed the concoction, closed her eyes, and leaned back against the headrest, if her grandmother wasn&#x2019;t mildly addicted.</p><p>Micah leaned over the seat. &#x201c;Can I try some?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even think about it,&#x201d; Charley said, and both Micah and Miss Honey looked at her as if she&#x2019;d just blurted out a string of swearwords. &#x201c;I mean&#x2014;I&#x2019;m sure Miss Honey needs her medicine. There&#x2019;s water in the cooler if you&#x2019;re thirsty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why your father bought land way out here is beyond me,&#x201d; Miss Honey said, a moment later. &#x201c;If he wanted to own a business he should have bought something in town. Russell Monroe has been trying to sell his barbershop for two years. I know he&#x2019;d have let it go for nothing. And I hear some rich white fella from New Orleans just bought the old bank building on Main Street. Gonna turn it into a snazzy hotel.&#x201d; She waved a dismissing hand toward the window. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no one out here but a bunch of crackers.&#x201d;</p><p>Charley felt her shirt clinging wetly to the knobs of her spine, and debated whether to tell Miss Honey how yesterday, soon after they crossed into the parish, she saw another car, a pickup, approaching fast in her rearview mirror. It rode her bumper, then slid parallel.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look,&#x201d; Charley had told Micah, though she couldn&#x2019;t help but look herself. The passenger, a white kid in a backwards baseball cap, stared at her for several long seconds, surveyed her car, then turned to the driver, who leaned forward. Charley turned her gaze back to the road, but the driver kept pace with her, even though he was driving in the opposite lane. She held her breath. Her hands shook. Finally, the pickup pulled ahead, glided in front of her, and for what felt like forever, she couldn&#x2019;t see anything but the lettering on the tailgate, the silhouettes of two naked ladies on the mud flaps. She eased her foot off the brake and fell back. The truck gunned its motor and seconds later it was gone, the glow of its brake lights disappearing as it rounded the curve. Were they in danger? Who could say, but for a moment, Charley wondered what her father had been thinking to leave her a sugarcane farm in south bumfuck Louisiana.</p><p>&#x201c;You never know why people do what they do,&#x201d; Charley said now, speaking louder so Micah would hear. &#x201c;You just have to assume they&#x2019;re doing their best.&#x201d; And then she repeated the lines she&#x2019;d been saying for the last ten months, the lines that had become her mantra: &#x201c;I think this move will be good for us. An adventure. A fresh start.&#x201d; Charley wasn&#x2019;t saying this just for Micah&#x2019;s sake, she was saying it for her own. Because the truth was, she needed this farm. It was the opportunity she&#x2019;d been hoping for. Until now, her life hadn&#x2019;t gone the way she planned. She loved her job teaching art to inner city kids, but it barely paid the bills or ate into the mountain of grad school loans. She drove a car that should have been scrapped for parts, and lived in a house she&#x2019;d never own. She was thirty-four, and widowed, and may just have been a terrible mother. She needed this farm, wherever it was. She needed a second chance. She needed momentum. And a good shove.</p><p>&#x201c;I reckon.&#x201d; Miss Honey dabbed her neck with her tissue again. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, I&#x2019;m glad y&#x2019;all are here. It&#x2019;s been too long. But sometimes, you go looking for adventure, all you find is disaster.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you mean, &#x2018;disaster&#x2019;?&#x201d; Micah said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going to happen?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a saying,&#x201d; Charley said, but for good measure she decided not to mention the pickup or how, for the rest of the drive, she pulled over every time a truck came up behind them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The paved road they&#x2019;d been following led to a dirt path&#x2014;a generous way to describe the strip of trampled ground deeply rutted with tread marks and grass growing up between. A wooden stake with the carved letter L leaned to one side.</p><p>Charley felt a rush of excitement, a warm tingling that spread over her arms and down her spine, causing her to feel a little lightheaded. &#x201c;This is it.&#x201d;</p><p>Dust billowed behind the Volvo until the path ended at a bank of trees. Woods stood tall and impassable to the left, but up ahead to the right sprawled open space. Charley&#x2019;s heart raced as she imagined what was out there: fields so splendidly verdant she&#x2019;d feel short of breath just looking at them. Her father left the door open and she had stepped through it.</p><p>Charley parked. Then she, Micah, and Miss Honey made their way over the clotted ground.</p><p>&#x201c;Holy moly!&#x201d; Micah cried. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s huge!&#x201d; She took a picture with the ancient Polaroid, then hurled a stick far into the tangle of weeds and creeping vines.</p><p>&#x201c;My God,&#x201d; Charley muttered. &#x201c;This can&#x2019;t be.&#x201d; Across the field, wide and long as ten city blocks, stunted cane stalks dotted the earth, their straggly leaves a starved shade of pale green with deeply sunburned edges. Grass and weeds grew thick and matted between the rows, which were preposterously rutted with tire tracks. Even to Charley&#x2019;s untrained eye, it was clear no one had been out there in months. Where were the neatly tilled rows, the lush cane plants high as a man&#x2019;s shoulder? Where was the moist soil, dark and rich as ground French Roast? Under a morning sky coated with clouds gray as concrete, Charley stared out over fields that should have looked like the hundreds of lush acres she passed on the drive down, but didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought this Frasier fella was managing the place,&#x201d; Miss Honey said, raising her hand to shield against the glare.</p><p>&#x201c;He was.&#x201d; Charley twisted her wedding ring absentmindedly. &#x201c;Last time we talked, he said something about replacing a tractor belt.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;d say he&#x2019;s got some explaining to do.&#x201d;</p><p>Charley consulted her watch. They were five minutes late. &#x201c;You think he&#x2019;s been here and left already?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t tell you what he might do,&#x201d; Miss Honey said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know this Frasier from Adam&#x2019;s housecat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know where we should put the cows,&#x201d; Micah declared, peering through her camera&#x2019;s viewfinder. &#x201c;They can live out by those trees.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t that kind of farm,&#x201d; Charley said.</p><p>&#x201c;But we can&#x2019;t have a farm without cows,&#x201d; Micah pressed. &#x201c;What about goats?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No goats.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, what then?&#x201d;</p><p>Charley glanced at her watch again, then squeezed the bridge of her nose. &#x201c;Sweetheart, why don&#x2019;t you walk around and take some pictures.&#x201d; White clouds, thick as mashed potatoes, drifted across the sky. Something that looked like a flat-winged bee bounced between the blossoming vines as hot air rose from the dirt.</p><p>&#x201c;My feet are starting to swell,&#x201d; Miss Honey said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be in the car.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was almost ten o&#x2019;clock before an old Ford F-150 with a &#x201c;Jesus is my co-pilot&#x201d; license place rambled down the road ahead of a long contrail of dust.

In addition to inspiring the public prayer of the church, the Psalms are an indispensable part of the private devotions of all who seek a closer relationship with God.Most important, however, the Psalms point toward the ultimate liberation of humanity from sin, death and despair through Jesus Christ.Father Pat Reardon, drawing on his long experience as an Episcopal, and then as a priest in the Orthodox Church, has produced a work of depth and devotion. He rightly understands that one cannot truly probe the deep meaning of the Psalms unless one understands them in the light of the redemption brought by Christ...He provides the fresh and intensely personal insights of a pastor to the study of the Book of Psalms.&#34;Every now and then a book comes along that is a small classic.

In fact, by 1942 Germany controlled almost the entire resources of continental Europe and was poised to move into the Middle East. The Soviet Union had lost the heart of its industry, and the United States was not yet armed.<br><br> The Allied victory in 1945 was not inevitable. Overy shows us exactly how the Allies regained military superiority and why they were able to do it. He recounts the decisive campaigns: the war at sea, the crucial battles on the eastern front, the air war, and the vast amphibious assault on Europe. He then explores the deeper factors affecting military success and failure: industrial strength, fighting ability, the quality of leadership, and the moral dimensions of the war. Photographs</p><p>Having won an unprecedented series of victories and acquired huge new territories in 1942, Germany and Japan seemed poised to dominate most of the world. A year later both empires were reeling back in the face of Allied assaults. The rapid turnaround, King&#39;s College history professor Richard Overy writes, came about largely as a result of technological innovation and structural responsiveness. The Allies were able to convert their economies to a war footing with few institutional fetters, while the Axis powers imposed layers of bureaucracy that often competed internally. In fact, Overy writes, at one point during the war, the Luftwaffe had more than 425 different aircraft models in production, the result of different state agencies&#39; and manufacturers&#39; vying to push their models into the order of battle. The defeated Axis powers&#39; conversion to their foes&#39; economic model enabled them, according to Overy, to become technological leaders in the postwar years. His study is full of detail, and it makes for very good reading.Richard Overy is the author of RAF, Why the Allies Won, The Battle of Britain, and The Dictators, winner of the Wolfson History Prize.

She lives in Cambridge, England.</p>FOREWORD<br> &nbsp;<br> Flowers do speak a language,<br> clear and intelligible. Observe them, reader,<br> love them, linger over them and ask your own heart<br> if they do not speak affection, benevolence and piety.<br> &nbsp;<br> In every culture and throughout time, flowers have been central to the human experience. Whether growing wild or in carefully tended gardens, blooming in works of art or written into the pages of great literature, flowers have always surrounded and supported us. They appear in our most significant rituals and traditions all around the globe: from east to west; from ancient civilization to the present day; when we hope or pray, love or mourn; we do it with flowers in our hands.<br> &nbsp;<br> But why do flowers play such a significant role in our lives? What mystery do they represent and reveal? And how does our deep connection to flowers show itself? In every season and in every country, the answers to these questions are different.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the Indian state of Uttarakhand, where the Ganga River drops out of the Himalayas and into the valley, a ceremony takes place every evening at sunset. While prayers buzz through a crackling PA system, pilgrims to the holy site of Har Ki Pauri (Steps of the Lord) fill banana-leaf boats with flowers &#x2013; roses, orchids, tulsi and marigolds &#x2013; then place a lit candle among the petals and float the fragrant bundle down the river with a hope, a prayer or a wish.<br> &nbsp;<br> Across the globe from the Ganga River, in Mexico and through-out Latin America, cempasuchil &#x2013; bright orange marigolds &#x2013; grow. Cempasuchil, the flower the Aztecs used to remember the deceased, is cultivated in preparation for Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead). Families plant seeds and tend their gardens, thinking of the loved ones they have lost as they watch the marigolds sprout, grow and finally blossom. The brilliant orange flowers are believed to help guide the souls of loved ones home, and for a single day the Mexican people find comfort in having the spirits of their loved ones with them once again.<br> &nbsp;<br> Every spring in Japan, citizens listen to the weather bureau forecast the Sakura Zensen (the cherry blossom front). At the height of the blossom, Hanami (flower viewing) festivals take place all across the country, with friends and family gathering for tea or lunch under the pink canopies. Festivities often go well into the night, with music and paper lanterns illuminating the trees. While the celebrations are joyful, they are brief: cherry trees are in full bloom for two weeks at the most. The perfect, delicate flowers have come to represent the essence of life itself &#x2013; shockingly beautiful and heartbreakingly fleeting.<br> &nbsp;<br> In France on May Day, there is a similar focus on a single flower: lily of the valley. This delicate white flower, which grows as a row of bell-shaped blossoms nestled in long green leaves, is often referred to as porte-bonheur &#x2013; literally, &#x2018;bringer of happiness&#x2019;. Every street corner overflows with the flower: florists have huge outdoor displays of the plant; people come in from the countryside to sell plants they&#x2019;ve grown in their garden or harvested in the woods. Makeshift stands support heaps of flowers in bundles held together with a ribbon. The lily of the valley is so profuse that even the Metro has a tinge of springtime sweetness, as commuters clutch fragrant bouquets of the delicate white flowers.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then, of course, there are the wedding ceremonies: from England to the United States and beyond, flowers play a part in every aspect of this important tradition, from the bridal bouquet to the centrepieces. At many weddings a flower girl precedes the bride, clutching a basket of rose petals and scattering them down the aisle. The petals she drops are meant to create a path of love and beauty that will carry the bride into her new life as a married woman.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Asia, the Americas, Japan and Europe, these traditions have remained constant for hundreds of years. It is astonishing to realize that while everything else around us has changed &#x2013; housing, transportation, technology, methods and styles of communication &#x2013; flowers and their traditions have remained the same. We grow them, we study them and we give them &#x2013; to guests, to hosts, to loved ones, in times of joy and sorrow, awe and appreciation. While both the traditions and the significance of the flowers vary from region to region, always there are flowers, and always there is the desire to communicate.<br> &nbsp;<br> But what is it that we are trying to say, and why do we use flowers to try to say it? What is it about the flower itself that we are drawn to? Is it the simple expression of the cycle of life we so admire: from seed to sapling, to bud to blossom, and back to seed? Is it the courage of the first snowdrop, braving the last days of winter to push through the frozen ground? Or is it the sweet fragrance of the rose &#x2013; a scent that physically changes our brain chemistry, bringing a rush of warmth and joy?<br> &nbsp;<br> It is these questions that have spawned symbolic flower languages in almost every culture since ancient times. From the nature worship of early religions to Greek and Roman mythology, humans have assigned floral symbols to Gods and deities, prophets and saints. In the Christian faith the Virgin Mary is forever associated with the white lily, from the story of the Apostles opening her casket and finding only roses and lilies; in the Hindu religion, deities&#x2019; eyes are often represented as flower blossoms, looking out with compassion and wisdom; the Buddha is frequently depicted sitting on an open lotus blossom, the symbol of full enlightenment.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Victorian era was the great age of the flower garden and of all things horticultural, and so it is not surprising that flower symbolism became particularly elaborate at this time. At the heart of the Victorians&#x2019; love of flowers was their strong and direct connection with nature, much more so and in quite a different way than our connection today. The majority of the population still lived on the land, nature itself was much more abundant and fruitful, and the notion that God spoke to man through the natural world, conveying messages, particularly moral ones, was an intrinsic part of everyday thinking. Increased trade and travel brought a wealth of new and exotic species from the East and the Americas, which were cultivated in hothouses and delighted over.<br> &nbsp;<br> The origin of the western language of flowers, an intricate system of floral symbolism in which each flower is assigned a specific meaning, is thought to have been inspired by the Turkish custom of s�lam &#x2013; a method of communicating through flowers and other objects. In the Turkish tradition, the objects did not carry a symbolic meaning; rather, the recipient would decode the message based on guessing words that rhymed with the object.<br> &nbsp;<br> The idea of the s�lam was popularized in Europe by the Turkish Embassy Letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, which were published after her death in 1763. Her letters described the s�lam as a method of communication between lovers in which it was possible to send messages &#x2018;without ever inking your fingers&#x2019;, and gave examples of their meanings. She did not call this method of communication a language of flowers, nor did she suggest the creation of a western equivalent. Yet when the letters were popularized in the nineteenth century, western culture &#x2013; already flower obsessed &#x2013; extracted from the list of objects that which they found to be romantic (flowers), got rid of the rest (metal, foodstuffs, dragon&#x2019;s blood, etc.) and began to assign definitions to each flower based on literature, poetry, art and horticulture.<br> &nbsp;<br> The first western language of flowers dictionary, Le Langage des Fleurs, written in 1819 by Charlotte de Latour (a pseudonym), was so popular that it created a minor industry. Countless numbers of illustrated floral dictionaries sprouted up in France and across Europe, eventually making their way overseas to America. Often written by journalists and editors of popular magazines, flower dictionaries were targeted at genteel young ladies, for whom the association of flowers and romantic love was immensely appealing. Their contents were all very similar: an alphabetical list of flowers with their symbolic meanings, explanations as to how certain flowers obtained their meanings &#x2013; usually from Classical mythology, folklore, medieval and Arthurian-type legends &#x2013; flower poetry, examples of bouquet combinations and the messages they convey, and more often than not something called the Floral Oracle, a description of various fortune-telling games using flowers. Luxurious bindings, unusual sizes and beautiful illustrations made each floral dictionary unique.<br> &nbsp;<br> There is little evidence that the Victorians actually used the language of flowers in a practical way; they didn&#x2019;t send continuous streams of bouquets to each other, but rather the books were meant for the &#x2018;centre&#x2019; (coffee) table and were to be studied, indulged in, and played as a game; every young lady wanted to be well-versed in the meanings of flowers. And though they didn&#x2019;t spend hours coding secret bouquets, the Victorians did set great store by flowers and used them extensively in everyday life, much more so than today. Bouquets as love tokens were sent, carnation buttonholes were extremely popular and women wore flowers a great deal &#x2013; in their hair, on their evening gowns, or tucked into a bodice. Flower symbolism was important and was applied to all the major occasions in life: roses, violets and forget-me-nots during courtship, orange blossoms at weddings and wreaths of cypress at funerals and as grave ornaments. From popular culture to high art, poets, painters, novelists, writers of children&#x2019;s books, magazine journalists, composers and lyricists all played with the idea in their work. Some took the language of flowers seriously, others poked gentle fun at it, &#x201c;but there is no doubt that it was a major phenomenon. One of the great paintings of the age was John Everett Millais&#x2019;s depiction of the drowned Ophelia, surrounded by flowers and drenched in symbolism: &#x2018;There&#x2019;s Rosemary, that&#x2019;s for remembrance;&nbsp;...&nbsp;and there is Pansies, that&#x2019;s for thoughts.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As the Victorian era came to an end, the popularity of the language of flowers began to fade. Queen Victoria died in 1901; little more than a decade later, the world was at war. The two world wars changed the way we related to each other as human beings for ever; the emerging technological age changed the way we related to the world around us for ever. Victorian sentiment &#x2013; allowing emotions to influence decisions &#x2013; became referred to with some distaste as &#x2018;sentimentality&#x2019; and became frowned upon. The era of the logical, scientific mind was ushered in. Huge developments in science and manufacturing prevailed, and in less than a century we had moved from horseback to high-speed trains to airplanes, from the pony express to the cellular phone, from Morse code to the Internet. But even as tastes and trends changed dramatically in the twentieth century, flowers themselves never went out of fashion. Flowers continued to be a way for humans to express complex emotions: World War I is inextricably linked to the poppy; the song &#x2018;where have all the flowers gone&#x2019; stirs up emotion for anyone who lived through the Vietnam War.</p><h2>Walker Evans: American Photographs: Seventy-Fifth Anniversary Edition</h2><p>More than any other artist, Walker Evans invented the images of essential America that we have long since accepted as fact, and his work has influenced not only modern photography but also literature, film and visual arts in other mediums. The original edition of <i>American Photographs</i> was a carefully prepared letterpress production, published by The Museum of Modern Art in 1938 to accompany an exhibition of photographs by Evans that captured scenes of America in the early 1930s. As noted on the jacket of the first edition, Evans, &#x201c;photographing in New England or Louisiana, watching a Cuban political funeral or a Mississippi flood, working cautiously so as to disturb nothing in the normal atmosphere of the average place, can be considered a kind of disembodied, burrowing eye, a conspirator against time and its hammers.&#x201d; This seventy-fifth anniversary edition of <i>American Photographs</i>, made with new reproductions, recreates the original 1938 edition as closely as possible to make the landmark publication available for a new generation. <i>American Photographs</i> has fallen out of print for long periods of time since it was first published, and even subsequent editions--two of which altered the design and typography of the book in small but significant ways--are often available only at libraries and rare bookstores. This version, like the fiftieth-anniversary edition produced by the Museum in 1988, captures the look and feel of the very first edition with the aid of new digital technologies.<br><br><b>Walker Evans</b> (1903&#x2013;1975) took up photography upon his return to New York in 1927, following a year in Paris when his aspiration to become a writer withered in the shadow of Fitzgerald, Hemingway and Joyce. In 1935, Evans was commissioned by the Farm Security Administration to photograph the effects of the Great Depression in the Southeast. During this time he took many of the photographs that appeared in his collaboration with James Agee, <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men </i>(1941), a book which has become a defining document of that era. Evans joined the staff of <i>Time </i>magazine in 1945 and shortly thereafter became an editor at <i>Fortune</i>, where he stayed for the next two decades. In 1964, he became a professor at the Yale University School of Art, where he taught until his death in 1975.</p><p>[Walker Evans} made work that was once plainspoken and eloquent - images that still define something essential and true about America and Americans. (Vince Alletti <i>The New Yorker</i>)<br><br>Published on the occasion of a solo show at the Museum of Modern Art, American Photographs fused Evans's avid learning from European books and journals about complex sequencing with his acute attention to bodies, faces, and places eclipsed by modern progress. No celebrities, no soaring skyscrapers -- in fact, nothing very new at all. This was a world persisting against the grain. The inscrutable photographs in suggestive, provocative order were the antithesis of the slick Life photo-stories Evans detested. (David Campany <i>Aperture Magazine</i>)<br><br>For those who have been waiting for years to own this classic photobook -- one of the very best and most influential photobooks ever published, in fact -- this is your chance. To mark the 75th anniversary of the original 1938 publication, the Museum of Modern Art has reissued American Photographs for the first time since 1988 (the 50th anniversary). While there were previous reissues, in 1962 and 1971, the book has often been out of print and hard to find, which has caused secondhand copies to soar. Not only is it a pleasure to see it back in print at an affordable price, but, according to the jacket copy, the editors and printers have used digital technology to "aid in emulating the precise cropping and finely tuned balance of the 1938 reproductions, capturing as never before the look and feel of the first edition." Certainly this book, with its iconic play grey dust jacket, elegant typography and blind-stamped black cloth binding, looks and feels timeless.

He lives with his family in rural Oregon.I heard it said God moves on the water. Well, I have looked for Him there. My thirst grows with his flood.<br><br> Our kin homesteaded where desert met lake. The hills in the near distance wore blankets of pine. Patterns of aspen marked the water. Beyond them the mountains stood blue on clear days and devoured the sun long before it left this world. From the home Pa built us we couldn't see the lake but we could see the willows along its edge and we could hear the wingbeats of doves. Bison calves still wandered in with the heifers and arrowheads clung to their shafts. This autumn air delivers me there still.<br><br> They arrived in 1864 by the deed I once held in my hand. Pa was fresh from the war and on a horse he took off a Johnny Reb. Pa told us he was a Yankee sharpshooter through the first two years of that war. He come home after to his family and found his own father's grave and his mother under the watch of a new man and his kid brother dying of infection. He stayed until the brother passed and then rode west.<br><br> Pa killed many men. I know that for certain. But he wasn't the kind to talk of it. The stories he told of that war was his histories. If Pa ran the schools pupils would memorize the names of each man killed on both sides.<br><br> Ma was dark skinned and Spanish speaking. Her kin was at some point subjects of Spain, France, Mexico, and the United States by the time they was forced from their home by Sam Houston and Santa Anna and the thousands of American settlers coming for what had been theirs. They fled the only direction without guns and come to settle in Kansas, peaceful land-rich Kansas. By the time Ma was of marrying age the war was kicking and the raiders come from Missouri and John Brown come from within and soon it was bloody torn-to-bits Kansas. Her intended was shot one night for no good reason at all and her brother who had joined the fighting returned ill of mind. Kansas wasn't Kansas no more. They rode on.<br><br> She was twenty-two and walking with a load on her shoulders somewhere in the plains when she heard a horse gaining and turned to see Pa slowing on her. Course he wasn't Pa yet. He was a stranger who introduced himself as Milt Harney. She said folks called her Rosa, her mother's name. I don't know what she thought of him but I know he memorized her details. There was sweat through her dress and flies so thick from the oxen she give up waving them off. A rare sight, a shapely girl without child or man. To hear Pa tell it there wasn't no west after he saw her, just the direction she was walking.<br><br> He took up with the uncle and the leader of the clan. Traveling poor as they done was slow work. No riding for those with legs. Folks now talk like everybody rode west but not many could afford a riding horse. So it was footwork and loads and dust so thick it turn your lungs to chalk. Pa had that horse and her uncle must've been looking to slip out from under his burden. A week on they was married by the book of a revivalist in a circle of wagons as a church.<br><br> After crossing the divide they broke off on their own for the valley that would become our home. "A barrel of sugar by autumn," he promised her. Pa would be a cattleman and to him that occupation promised wealth and maybe a mountain to name as his own.<br><br> To start he got homestead acres and unspoken grazing access to the nearby Indian lands. There was a lake and the valley held its green long after the hills went to brown.<br><br> When they arrived she was already growing with child. Ma wept when she saw the valley. Cranes danced at sunrise and wildflowers shone like embers in the grass. Here no view reminded her of someone she had lost. Noah come along that autumn.<br><br> Noah. My brother's name.<br><br> Even now I turn and expect to see him riding hard for supper. How many times did I push back the cowhide flap and see him leading a string of dust down the valley? Never late for grub and never one to show up on a dry horse, that brother of mine.<br><br> You knew him best but you didn't know him then, before. Sure you've heard the stories folks tell. They make him a killer and hellion. Little children hear his name, Noah Harney, and they see men falling from stagecoaches and smoke rising from a barrel and they think a man is made real by the violence he wields.<br><br> Noah was a killer, that is certain. I ain't never been sure if he was right.<br><br> Ma didn�t live past my entrance to this world on account I wasn�t no good at getting born. I set Ma to bleeding.<br><br> Pa knew right off there was trouble. She was twenty-seven and her color was slipping and her lips was going purple-her life was draining from her and there wasn't nothing Pa knew to do. He wanted to ride for help but she held him back. She asked him to build up the fire. He did as she asked. Under the rest Pa was a good soul, full of respect for the women in his life, which might be the straightest measure of a man.<br><br> Ma pulled little Noah close. He was five then. He put his head on her shoulder and touched his fingers to my dewy head. "Ma, how come you so cold?"<br><br> She pulled up the quilt around them, us. "Don't worry, my child."<br><br> "Milt?" she asked of Pa. These was her final words on this earth: "Play me our song."<br><br> As Pa put bow to string, Ma put her nipple to my lips. She gave me my mother. Some things in this world you don't never forget even if you ain't got no memories of them.<br><br> The one time he spoke of her passing, Pa talked most of the storm that night and how the snow climbed the door. It blew in through the slats and flakes drifted toward the fire and turned to rain halfway. The water and her blood turned the dirt floor to mud.<br><br> After a time with her gone I got to shivering. It was my brother who wrapped me in a blanket and sat with me before the fire and gave his finger to my gums so I might stop crying for her.<br><br> I asked Pa what he done with her remains.<br><br> What choice did he have but to put her to rest in the snow outside until spring might allow a shovel to crack the earth. He must've carried her there. I imagine he took a final moment together. Come inside and stood a piece looking on us. A cattleman alone now with a too young boy and a baby girl.<br><br> I suspect he looked on me a long time trying to feel something different. I never did know what Pa felt, not even when I knew him best. When he come inside from leaving his young wife in the snow and saw the thing that put her there, what did he feel? How could it have been love?<br><br> Pa hired a wet nurse who�d been a whore over in Clayville. She had her own baby boy. Pa wasn�t in no state to judge character. I don�t remember her none, she was with us just one season, till she located his savings and rode off with it. After that it was just us. He grew me on chewed venison, bone marrow, and pulped tubers, as was the method in them days.<br><br> Pa did right considering. Most men would've turned to stone and been a mountain between the table and stove. Nothing to do but overcome a father like that. No, Pa was tender for us. His hands was leather and his eyes was gray and he might've been short on words but he wasn't short on feeling. Music turned him to butter.<br><br> He must've sought a new woman. He must've considered putting us to another family. The Mormons down the valley already had a couple of their own. Handing us off would've been easy enough, and expected in that time.<br><br> But he kept us and did right by us, right as he could. He had nearly two hundred head that spring. Most he'd ever have. Tending to us kids was the reason.<br><br> Most what I know about Ma come from Noah. He was five when she passed but might as well have spent a lifetime in her lee from all the stories he told. They come from him with no more thought than a belch. It was my brother too who taught me to dress, to squat over the night pot, to grow my hair long and braid it before sleep. These things he learned from watching her be a woman.<br><br> I ain't got no recollections of her voice but I'd know the sound. As a child I went about my chores in silence so as not to miss her when she come. I was certain she would come. Each time I think of our family place I feel her. She is the water brought inside by the camas, you don't see her none but without her there ain't no flower.<br><br> I did the woman work while Pa and Noah labored the spread. I longed to be with them, in truth. I dreaded my lonely washings and stewings and mendings and tendings. But need better breed enthusiasm or you in for a tough go in this life. By six I was doing a half-decent show of laundry. By eight I could skin down a buck so long as there was a stool I could stand on for reaching. Little me had to hang on the hide to get it to peel. My cooking wasn�t much seeing as I learned from Pa but it was hot and it kept. He only complained if I skimped on the meat, and in that age the hills was still flush with meat.<br><br> I kept on Ma's pattern of things. Mondays was churning, Tuesdays baking, Wednesdays canning, Thursdays jerking, Fridays mending, Saturdays baths and laundry, Sundays cleaning. Most times when alone I pretended I was Ma. She wouldn't stand for a misplaced stitch or a stain left to dry. In every task my burden was the perfection she would've delivered had I not took her.<br><br> I slept under the near-finished birth quilt on my side of the bed Noah and me shared. This is how we'd slept since the beginning and so we kept on sleeping like a mother and child, me curled into him and his warm breath in my hair all those cold desert nights. In my slumber I dreamed her with us and understand those breaths to be hers and so lived what never was.<br><br> If Pa and Noah was working a long way off and I missed her painful I might pull out her things. Pa kept them in a trunk under the bed. There was a dress, a calico. There was shoes polished black. The left one had a scrape that cut into the leather near the toe. I never put them on or let them touch the floor. They was hers and I had taken enough. But I did allow myself to touch them. That's how I come to find a chain and a locket made of silver folded inside that calico. The locket held the image of a young girl. I assumed for years the girl was Ma. That girl is still the mother I see. But the picture wasn't Ma at all. Pa told me years on that it might've been her younger sister who died of fever, but it wasn't Ma.<br><br> In the bottom corner of the trunk was her Good Book. She knew how to read and she taught Pa. Pa told me, "A woman's best chance in this world is to know the Good Book better than the men in her life." He said as much but he wasn't spending no time teaching me to read.<br><br> Under the bed beside the trunk was a box long as an arm. Pa's fiddle. He drew it out only on Ma's birthday, in April, when the camas pushed up from the green meadows. He would set it upon the bed and then sit back from it and put his fist to thigh as he was wont to do when he thought of her. One year he caught me staring on him, and he drew me between him and that box, maybe so I couldn't see his wet eyes. His fingers passed over the wood.<br><br> "Pa?"<br><br> "Your mother couldn't get her fill of music. She wanted me to play any chance. She kept time with her heel. She never forgot the time."<br><br> Inside was a vivid red cloth. It was an age when men and women in town wore browns and olives and dusty white. Colors belonged to the hills in autumn, to the sunset and wildflowers and trout that rolled in the lake, the Indian paint we saw less and less of. I felt Pa quit his breathing at the sight of that red.<br><br> He had learned during the war and brought the fiddle west. It was his music that won Ma over those nights among the wagons. Noah remembered him playing. Noah said in them days every dark was warded off by Pa's song.<br><br> The lament he played on Ma's birthday I never heard outside our family. I do believe he made it up. Or maybe he and Ma together made it up. Either way it was theirs. The song leaned on mournful drawn-out notes and two steep climbs into high emotion. It was in no hurry to conclude, and neither was its audience. I am haunted by that song.<br><br> I remember staring up at his great shape with the fiddle to his chin and the bow cutting back and forth and his song slicing me open. I can't forget the word "Rowhine" burned into the body of that fiddle. It was branded like a beast, and so I come to think of the instrument as its own animal and Pa as its handler.<br><br> For all his tenderness Pa was quick to anger and it was the little things that set him loose. Regular enough I caught the back of his hand. Noah took whuppings too. I think that�s how he got so quick with the stories. He knew his best luck was in talking Pa cool. He bent the man�s mind. Pa wasn�t slow but I don�t reckon he was ever as keen as his boy.</p><h2>The White Man&#39;s Burden: Why the West&#39;s Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good</h2><p><b>From one of the world&#x2019;s best-known development economists&#x2014;an excoriating attack on the tragic hubris of the West&#x2019;s efforts to improve the lot of the so-called developing world</b><p>In his previous book, <i>The Elusive Quest for Growth</i>, William Easterly criticized the utter ineffectiveness of Western organizations to mitigate global poverty, and he was promptly fired by his then-employer, the World Bank. <i>The White Man&#x2019;s Burden</i> is his widely anticipated counterpunch&#x2014;a brilliant and blistering indictment of the West&#x2019;s economic policies for the world&#x2019;s poor. Sometimes angry, sometimes irreverent, but always clear-eyed and rigorous, Easterly argues that we in the West need to face our own history of ineptitude and draw the proper conclusions, especially at a time when the question of our ability to transplant Western institutions has become one of the most pressing issues we face.<br><br></p></p><p>William Easterly is a professor of economics at New York University and a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development. He was a senior research economist at the World Bank for more than sixteen years. In addition to his academic work, he has written widely in recent years for <b>The Washington Post</b>, <b>Wall Street Journal</b>, <b>Financial Times</b>, <b>Forbes</b>, and <b>Foreign Policy</b>, among others. He is the author of the acclaimed book <b>The Elusive Quest for Growth: Economists' Adventures and Misadventures in the Tropics</b>. He has worked in many areas of the developing world, most extensively in Africa, Latin America, and Russia.This is the season for critiques of global misadventures, and William Easterly has written a valuable one. His target in his puckishly titled The White Man's Burden is the spirit of benign meddling that lies behind foreign aid, foreign military interventions and such do-gooder institutions as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the United Nations. In his account, such efforts are fatally contaminated by what the philosopher Karl Popper called "utopian social engineering." Easterly's list of well-meaning villains stretches from the economist Jeffrey Sachs to the rock singer and charity impresario Bono.<p> His analysis is depressing but quite readable -- thanks largely to his skill in giving lively names and conceptual handles to his explanations for why the West's charitable works in fact accomplish "so much ill and so little good." The do-gooders' fundamental flaw, he argues, is that they are "Planners," who seek to impose solutions from the top down, rather than "Searchers," who adapt to the real life and culture of foreign lands from the bottom up. The Planners believe in "the Big Push" -- an infusion of foreign aid and economic advice that will lift poor countries past the poverty trap and into prosperity. But the Planners are almost always wrong, Easterly contends, because they ignore the cultural, political and bureaucratic obstacles that impede the delivery of real assistance (as opposed to plans for such assistance) to the world's poor. "The right plan is to have no plan," he asserts, in an economist's version of a Zen koan. </p><p></p><p>Think of Easterly as a kind of anti-Thomas L. Friedman. His dyspeptic view of globalization contrasts with the optimism of the New York Times columnist, but he has written his broadside in a brisk, Friedman-esque style of aphorisms, anecdotes and witty headings. Some of his section and chapter titles convey the breezy tone in which he delivers his gloomy analysis: "Why Planners Cannot Bring Prosperity"; "The Legend of the Big Push"; "The Rich Have Markets, the Poor Have Bureaucrats." Scattered throughout the book are upbeat "Snapshots" of poor Africans and Asians whom Easterly, now an economics professor at New York University, met on his travels during more than 16 years spent working as a World Bank development economist; he also offers portraits of the "Searchers" who are helping the developing world. </p><p> I confess that I occasionally began to find all the aphorisms and snapshots annoying; there actually is such a thing as a book about development economics that is too readable. And I would have been happier if his sainted Searchers had been subject to a bit more of the same skepticism that Easterly applies to the odious Planners. Not to diminish the "social entrepreneurs" whom Easterly celebrates, but their well-publicized efforts are a bit of a racket too. I've met with and marveled at some of the same African and Asian innovators Easterly applauds, but it is a tad utopian to think that these little examples will add up to big changes, absent the fundamental reforms for which Easterly has such scorn. For instance, he praises the success of an NGO called Population Services International in finding a way for poor Africans to make a profit distributing the bed nets that can prevent malaria. But surely the challenge for development economists is to find ways to replicate such efforts on a larger scale, which involves the dreaded "P" word.</p><p> What makes this book valuable is its devastating detail. Easterly, the author of an influential previous book, The Elusive Quest for Growth, has assembled overwhelming evidence of how little has been accomplished with the hundreds of billions of dollars in aid money, the thousands of advisory missions, the millions of reports and studies. Rebutting the "Big Push" idea favored by World Bank planners, he notes that 22 African countries spent $342 billion on public investment from 1970 to 1994 and received another $187 billion in foreign aid over that period. But the productivity gain from all this investment was zero. As an example of the Planners' folly, he cites the $5 billion spent since 1979 on a publicly owned steel mill in Nigeria that has yet to produce any steel. </p><p>Easterly's critique of the World Bank and the IMF is persuasive. He argues that the IMF's structural-adjustment lending -- in which indebted countries get more money on the condition that they agree to Planners' free-market reforms -- simply hasn't worked. One big reason is that the IMF, like the World Bank, is always fudging its failures, finding excuses for why past aid and advice haven't worked, discovering reasons to pump in even more assistance. Indeed, Easterly finds a freakish correlation between IMF interventions and failed states. He notes the role corruption has played in distorting foreign aid and the growing insistence of aid donors on "good governance." But he cautions that attempting to change political cultures from afar often produces a show of good governance -- like the 2,400 reports Tanzania must produce every year for aid donors -- rather than the real thing. The absurdity of this hortatory culture emerges in his observation that among the 185 actions recommended by the 2002 Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable Development was "efficient use of cow dung." </p><p>With all of Easterly's aid-bashing, one might imagine that he is a conservative promoter of market solutions. But some of his most powerful criticism is reserved for the Planners who advocated "shock therapy" free-market reforms in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Free markets can't be imposed from outside, he insists, citing the example of the inefficient Soviet-era plants that survived their entry into the market era via their communist bosses' genius for bartering and cronyism. "The Soviet-trained plant managers at the bottom outwitted the shock therapists at the top," he writes. He finds a similar failure of free-market diktats in Latin America. The best era for Latin American growth was 1950 to 1980, the heyday of state intervention, while growth slowed in the market-reform years of the 1990s. As a result, Easterly argues, "the backlash against free markets is unfortunately now gaining strength in Latin America." </p><p>So what works? Easterly's argument is that if it's imposed from the outside, almost nothing works -- in either the economic or political sphere. It's no accident, he argues, that the great East Asian economic success stories of recent decades -- Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand -- all took place in countries that were never successfully colonized by the West. These nations evolved their own cultures, rules and disciplines and built an indigenous foundation for rapid economic growth. The region's laggard is the one nation that was colonized: the Philippines.</p><p> Easterly's dissection of the interventionist impulse of the Planners is powerful. His enthusiasm for the bottom-up successes of the Searchers is less so. He's looking hard for something encouraging to say, but it's a measure of the potency of his corrosive analysis that the good news isn't very convincing. </p><p>Reviewed by David Ignatius <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

Unfortunately, the subject has gained a notorious reputation for difficulty, with forbidding looking mathematics and a peculiar diagrammatic language described in an array of unforgiving, weighty textbooks aimed firmly at aspiring professionals. However, quantum field theory is too important, too beautiful, and too engaging to be restricted to the professionals. This book on quantum field theory is designed to be different. It is written by experimental physicists and aims to provide the interested amateur with a bridge from undergraduate physics to quantum field theory. The imagined reader is a gifted amateur, possessing a curious and adaptable mind, looking to be told an entertaining and intellectually stimulating story, but who will not feel patronised if a few mathematical niceties are spelled out in detail. Using numerous worked examples, diagrams, and careful physically motivated explanations, this book will smooth the path towards understanding the radically different and revolutionary view of the physical world that quantum field theory provides, and which all physicists should have the opportunity to experience.<br><br>To request a copy of the Solutions Manual, visit http://global.oup.com/uk/academic/physics/admin/solutions.<br></p><p><br>Tom Lancaster, <em>Lecturer in Physics, Department of Physics, University of Durham</em>,Stephen J.

I did a respectable job of it too&#x2014;�the dying, I mean, not the watching.<br><br>The key to dying well is to make a final verbal ejaculation that is full of rage and pain but not tainted in the least by squeals of terror or pleas for mercy. This was my father&#x2019;s wisdom&#x2014;�about the only shred of it that has managed to lodge firmly in my mind all these years. He died while trying to steal somebody else&#x2019;s cows.<br><br>It would be an ignominious end today, but before the common era in Ireland, it was honorable and manly to die in a cattle raid, as such theft was called. Before he left to meet his doom, my father must have had some dark premonition about it, because he shared with me all his opinions about dying properly, and I will never forget his final words: &#x201c;A man&#x2019;s supposed to shit himself after he dies, son, not before. Try to remember that, lad, so that when your time comes, you won&#x2019;t make a right girly mess of it. Now fuck off and go play in the bog.&#x201d;<br><br>Like many silly codes of bravery and manliness, the meat of my father&#x2019;s instruction on how to die well can be distilled to a simple slogan: Die angry at maximum volume. (Dying silently is out of the question; the world&#x2019;s last Druid should not go gentle into that good night.)<br><br>During infrequent spates of morbidity, I used to speculate on my eventual manner of death. I figured it would happen on a city street somewhere, cut off from the power of the earth, unable to summon a magical mulligan that would let me see the sunrise. But at the same time, I hoped it would be in a cool city with a bitchin&#x2019; name, like Kathmandu or Bangkok or maybe Climax, Michigan. I never thought it would be in a dried-�up place called Tuba City.<br><br>Situated in the southwestern portion of the Navajo Nation in Arizona, Tuba City rests on a red sandstone mesa with no visible means of economic support. The first question I asked when I saw it&#x2014;�besides &#x201c;Where are all the tubas?&#x201d;&#x2014;�was, &#x201c;Why is anybody living here?&#x201d; The red rocks may have a stark beauty to them, but beyond that Tuba City is nearly treeless, dusty, and notably lacking in modern amenities of dubious worth, like golf courses and cafeteria-�style dining. It does have a reservoir and some pastures nestled into a canyon, but otherwise it&#x2019;s puzzling why nine thousand souls would adopt an address there.<br><br>On the north end of town, where the BIA Road intersects with Indian Route 6220, a large white water tower juts out of the desert. It overlooks a few dilapidated trailers on the very edge of the city, and then there is naught but a rocky mesa with scattered shrubs gamely trying to make a living in a few inches of sandy soil. I&#x2019;d flown to the top of the tower as an owl, carrying a wee pair of binoculars in my talons, and now I was camouflaged in my human form, lying flat, and peering northeast into the barren waste where I was about to die.<br><br>The dying had to be done. The Morrigan had seen it in a lucid vision, and she doesn&#x2019;t get those unless it&#x2019;s really dire and inevitable, like James Earl Jones telling you in his Darth Vader voice, &#x201c;It is your desss-�tiny.&#x201d; And, frankly, I probably deserved it. I&#x2019;d been very naughty recently and, in retrospect, epically stupid. Because I couldn&#x2019;t bear to break my word, I&#x2019;d taken Leif Helgarson to Asgard to kill Thor and he managed to pull it off, but we killed a few extra �sir in the process and turned Odin into a drooling vegetable. Now the remaining �sir were slavering for me to shuffle off my mortal coil, as were several other thunder gods who took Thor&#x2019;s demise as a personal affront to all things thundery.<br><br>After building flaming funeral ships for their dead and resolving to avenge them&#x2014;�for some people approach vengeance like an all-�you-�can-�eat buffet&#x2014;�the �sir sent T�r and Vidar after the surviving members of our company. I had no idea where Perun or Zhang Guo Lao were hiding, and I hadn&#x2019;t an inkling of whether Hrym and the frost giants ever made it out of Asgard. Leif was safe, because they saw Thor smash his skull with Mj�llnir; thanks to the peculiar regeneration capabilities of vampires and the dutiful attentions of Dr. Snorri Jodursson, Leif hadn&#x2019;t quite died, but it would be some time before we knew if he&#x2019;d make a full recovery.<br><br>I, on the other hand, wasn&#x2019;t safe at all, because I had people to look out for. Perun could spend the next century as an eagle and they&#x2019;d never find him. Zhang Guo Lao, I&#x2019;d heard, was capable of true invisibility when he stood still; since he could go full ninja, they&#x2019;d never get him either. I could go to a nice plane somewhere and be safe&#x2014;�I could even take Oberon and Granuaile with me&#x2014;�but without true contact with the elementals of earth, Granuaile wouldn&#x2019;t be able to advance her training as a Druid, and the world desperately needs more Druids. So my choices were to stay on earth and die or leave earth and let the world slowly die of neglect&#x2014;�which wouldn&#x2019;t truly help, since all planes connected to earth would die at the same time.<br><br>I decided to stay and die. Loudly.<br><br>T�r and Vidar found me quickly enough once they knew who to ask for. I&#x2019;d blown my cover somewhat spectacularly some months earlier by killing Aenghus �g, so by now almost anyone paranormal or supernatural could have pointed them to Arizona. They chased me up to Tuba City, towing along five thunder gods for backup: Ukko from Finland, Indra from India, Lei Gong from China, Raijin from Japan, and Shango from Nigeria. All of them are very powerful gods and quite beloved by their people, but few are the tales in which we hear of their wit or perception.<br><br>Indra was quite the character, for example, and undoubtedly the most powerful of the lot currently. He had a reputation for lovin&#x2019; the ladies, a tendency I couldn&#x2019;t criticize myself, but he got himself into some awful trouble for it once. He chose to lay down with the wife of a magician, who of course found out immediately that Indra was &#x201c;in da house&#x201d; and assigned him a punishment worthy of Dante: Since the thunder god could think of nothing but vaginas, the cuckolded husband cursed Indra with a thousand vaginas all over his body. Indra had to walk around like that for a while, until Krishna took pity on him and commuted the sentence by turning all the vaginas into eyes. Still, think of the optometrist appointments.<br><br>The Morrigan observed, &#x201c;They may be sharing the brain of a nuthatch between them.&#x201d; She was perched on the water tower beside me in the shape of a battle crow, making sure that I &#x201c;died&#x201d; precisely as her vision foretold. We&#x2019;d both been worried initially about her vision of my death&#x2014;�she because it meant she&#x2019;d break her oath to keep me alive, and I for obvious reasons&#x2014;�until I remembered the Plan. I&#x2019;d conceived the Plan before the Morrigan shared her vision with me but realized only later that the Plan could fulfill her vision of my death without me actually having to die for it. Now we watched with faint amusement as someone who looked like me cursed the circling thunder gods and asserted that they all were spawned from the puffy red asses of baboons. The gods sent bolt after bolt of lightning at him with no apparent effect as he stood in a puddle of mud.<br><br>&#x201c;Give them a little credit, Morrigan,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;They found me here, after all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only after you allowed them to by parading around this foolish copy of yourself. It still took them a week, but, very well: They are sharing the brains of two nuthatches.&#x201d;<br><br>The Atticus O&#x2019;Sullivan they assaulted was a near-�perfect replica. The tattoos on his right side were a precise copy of mine. The slightly curly mane of red hair would have shone luxuriantly in the sun had it not been pouring rain on him, and the goatee blazed with character on his chin. He was foulmouthed and had his Irish up, and he had my wallet and my cell phone in the pockets of his jeans. There was an iron amulet on a silver chain around his neck, with five square charms on either side of it and a fulgurite talisman in the back protecting him from the lightning. The fulgurite was real, but the amulet and charms were little more than costume jewelry. He did, however, carry Fragarach in his right hand&#x2014;�the real Fragarach, not a facsimile&#x2014;�for extra special verisimilitude.<br><br>Yet a clever enemy would not have been fooled. He didn&#x2019;t have Oberon or Granuaile by his side, for one thing, and he wasn&#x2019;t casting a single Druidic binding&#x2014;�not that this bunch would know it if he did. They were still trying to fry him electrically.<br><br>&#x201c;What are they thinking?&#x201d; the Morrigan asked. &#x201c;If the first hundred lightning bolts don&#x2019;t work, the hundred-� and-�first one will?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That strategy would require them to count,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;which is improbable if they&#x2019;re sharing two nuthatch brains.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good point,&#x201d; the Morrigan conceded.<br><br>T�r, the Norse god of single combat, waved off the thunder gods to approach my double with a shield and an axe. Vidar, Odin&#x2019;s son, armed with a long sword, followed close behind. The thunder gods floated down to the muddy earth behind the faux Atticus to cut off any escape.<br><br>Poor T�r clearly didn&#x2019;t know anything about Fragarach. The only people who saw me use it in Asgard died immediately afterward, and thus he&#x2019;d never been told that my ancient Fae sword cut through shields and armor like a chainsaw through mozzarella. T�r crouched behind his shield as my double charged, thinking to take the blow and then strike back quickly with his axe. He took the blow all right. He took it right through the center of his body, as Fragarach sliced down through his shield, his forearm, and his torso. Everyone&#x2014;�including my double&#x2014;�was startled that T�r was now half off. Literally.<br><br>But Vidar, the god of vengeance, recovered first. Yelling, &#x201c;For Odin!&#x201d; he thrust his long sword into the �unprotected left side of that handsome Irish lad&#x2019;s rib cage, definitely stabbing a lung and maybe the liver too. The man who was supposed to be me cried out his pain magnificently&#x2014;�&#x201c;Garrl! Urk! Auggh!&#x201d;&#x2014;�and tried to raise Fragarach for another blow, but the strength wasn&#x2019;t in his limbs anymore. Vidar yanked out his sword with a slurping noise, and the Druid poseur collapsed in the mud.<br><br>They apparently knew enough about Druids not to leave it there. They didn&#x2019;t want me healing from a wound that would be mortal to anyone else. So they all descended on the body and chopped it up into pieces with whatever gigantic, godlike phallus-�weapon they had, far beyond my capacity to heal.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeesh. What a mess,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Cue the Chooser of the Slain.&#x201d;</p><h2>Mark Kistler&#39;s Draw Squad</h2><p>As "Commander Mark" on his national PBS TV series <i>The Secret City,</i> Mark Kistler has taught 10 million viewers of all ages how to draw. <i>Mark Kistler's Draw Squad</i> gathers all his zany, effective shortcuts to basic drawing skills into a book that will delight would be artists of all ages. <br> Like his TV show, the thirty lessons in this book are peppered with jokes, tips, and slogans, and organized in easy-to-follow steps. "Warm-up" exercises generate enthusiasm; the "Key Drawing Words" develop specific skills; practice pages are provided for hands-on participation; and the Commander's own lively sketches and "contests" invite you to add your own creative touches. His bubbling energy, flashes of whimsy, and talent as a teacher make learning to draw fun and easy -- even for those who swear they can't draw a straight line!</p><p>Mark Kistler is a cartoonist, an illustrator, and the producer and star of&nbsp;<i>Mark Kistler's Imagination Station,</i>&nbsp;currently airing on public television nationwide. The author of the wildly popular drawing books&nbsp;<i>Mark Kistler's Draw Squad</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mark Kistler's Imagination Station,</i>&nbsp;Kistler lives in Santa Barbara, California.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>"I Can't Even Draw A Straight Line" Dissolving a Popular Myth</b><br><br>What if I handed you a piece of blank paper and a pencil and asked you to draw a house. What would you say? I've asked this question to thousands of adults in my workshops, and invariably they give me the same response: <i>I can't even draw a straight line!</i><br><br>You've probably always believed that you needed talent before you could learn how to draw. Consequently, you've wished that you had some. Well, I've got a surprise for you -- you have enormous stockpiles of talent stored away. It's just that you've never been exposed to a systematic program, offering rules to follow, structured goals to achieve, and step-by-step lessons to build your drawing talent.<br><br><i>Mark Kistler's Draw Squad</i> is the culmination of everything I've learned from my master teacher, Bruce McIntyre, and from my nine years of classroom teaching.<br><br>My first class began with only 20 students. Within a year the enthusiasm generated by those first students burst the classroom seams to 600 students! "Hey, I can draw!" excitement has been building ever since. From the thousands of schools where I've lectured throughout the country, to the airing of my childrens' television show, "The Secret City," on national public television, literally millions of students have been able to dissolve that ridiculous myth of "I can't even draw a straight line!"<br><br>Each of these students has conquered the flat surface of a piece of paper with what I call "pencil power." Pencil power is the understanding of the Ten Key Words of Drawing.<br><br>My philosophy is simple. I'll teach you the Ten Key Words of Drawing. You take these words and nourish them with a daily 20-minute drawing workout. In one week, you'll see an incredible difference in your drawing skills. Once you understand the Ten Key Words, you will be drawing creatively and <i>confidently</i> in three dimensions. I promise. It's that simple. I call it "The Drawing Diet." Don't get alarmed; it's the easiest diet you'll ever go on!<br><br>Are you still skeptical? I mean, sure <i>kids</i> can learn to draw. They're brimming with imagination just waiting to get out. What ever happened to that creative spontaneity we once had in kindergarten, anyway? What happened to that "art attack" (this is what I call that uncontrollable need to draw...Draw, Draw, Draw!) enthusiasm we once had back in the first grade? Remember plunging your hands into a milk carton of bright wonderful paint and splashing it across an oversized sheet of paper? Remember splashing it across your entire desk, your clothes, and the kid sitting next to you (now that's an art attack!)?<br><br>Where has our childhood magicland of imagination gone? Ah...I truly believe this wonderfully powerful imagination hasn't gone anywhere at all. It's sitting there inside of us just where we left it years ago. It's back with all those other childish things we slowly lost confidence in and eventually traded for adulthood.<br><br>But, you can avoid this breakdown in confidence and creativity. I believe that it stems, in part, from the fact that no one has approached the teaching of drawing skills in the same successful method that reading and mathematics have been taught; that is, starting with the fundamentals.<br><br>In mathematics classes, students begin with simple, simple, simple addition and subtraction (with visual aids, I might add! Three oranges minus one orange equals...). After that comes multiplication and division, and after that the more complex branches of math, but even so, the fundamentals are always maintained.<br><br>Reading and writing are treated in the same systematic way. First the alphabet is introduced, then a vocabulary is built, then sentences, etc., etc., etc., and, oh, yes, lots of books need reading and lots of essays need writing, but still, the most important element is daily practice! I think you see my point now. We can't expect a student to solve math problems by giving him or her a piece of paper and a pencil and saying, "Okay, do math." Yet, it's very common to give a student that same piece of paper and pencil and say, "Okay, draw, and by all means, be as creative as you like!"<br><br>That's exactly what happened to most of us as kids. After thousands of attempts at drawing and very little success at conquering a simple piece of paper, we found a way out, the I-can't-even-draw-a-straight-line escape. This is what I call "The Creativity Crunch Syndrome."<br><br>Don't worry. The teaching of drawing hasn't been completely abandoned. A giant art wave is sweeping through our nation's school system. Teachers everywhere are realizing the importance of drawing in the classroom. We are starting to notice the impact of years of brilliant work by international, national, and statewide art education associations. Moreover, the publication of the thoughts and programs of such geniuses as Bruce Mclntyre <i>(Drawing Textbook),</i> Betty Edwards <i>(Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain),</i> Mona Brookes (Drawing With Children), and the former president of the Texas Art Education Association, James Clarke <i>(The 4th "R" in Education is Art!)</i> have contributed enormously. In addition, such institutes as The National Art Education Association, The Getty Foundation, and The John F. Kennedy Center have, through innovative research and classroom application, developed many workable and results-oriented programs. With all of these super brains behind quality art education, I'm confident students today won't need to endure the "creativity crunching years" like we did.<br><br>Let me give you a little history on how I became so involved in the systematic teaching of drawing. I was fortunate enough to study for 12 years under the guidance of Bruce McIntyre, a man so dedicated to kids that he left Walt Disney Studios for them. lie decided to dedicate his life to teaching kids how to draw. Building from Bruce's 44 years of experience, I developed a series of drawing lessons designed to strengthen a child's self-esteem. My success-oriented drawing lessons first splashed across the country in my 1985 national public television role as "Commander Mark" of the Secret City, a wonderful show of fun, fantasy, and adventure. Millions of viewers learned how to draw using the very system that you are about to learn. Over 150,000 letters from kids, parents, grandparents, and teachers motivated me to turn my program into an informative, yet enjoyable book. During the past two years, since the show began airing, I've compiled notes from my classroom video productions, classroom lectures, summer art "flight" schools (we let our pencil leads do the flying), and a national school assembly tour.<br><br>And, here it is...30 incredibly fun, enriching, sequential lessons that will teach you how to blast across a two-dimensional surface with pencil power. You will learn how to turn that simple white piece of paper into an amazing three-dimensional space! In a few short weeks, I know you'll be looking at your "Daily Drawing Journal" and saying exactly what all of my students say:<br><br>"Wow, like this is totally rad, man. I really can, like, draw. Wow!"<br><br>So, are you ready to get started? Complete the following pre-test:<br><br><b>The Pre-Test</b><br><br>"Oh, no!!! Not a drawing test! Augh! I can't even draw a straight line!!!"<br><br>I knew you'd say that. I assure you, this is only a gauge for you to measure your current drawing skills. As time goes by, you'll have this pre-test as a reference with which to judge your progress, and as a "before-and-after" journal entry.<br><br>When I ask elementary school kids to draw me a house, these little, creative geniuses don't just draw me a house, they draw barns and castles and space stations. It takes a lot of coaxing to get adults' creative self-esteem high enough to allow them to draw.<br><br>Before I show you how most adults draw a house and why they draw it the way they do, I want you to put aside that I can't even draw a straight line notion, and draw a house. Relax, loosen your fingers...and let your pencil fly!!!<br><br>Take another couple of minutes and draw me an airplane. What? I heard what you muttered under your breath, but you're wrong. You can draw! The house and the airplane drawings are important in proving a point! So, even if you think these drawings look like over-cooked spaghetti, keep them for comparison's sake. I promise you. You're going to be amazed by your progress in less than an hour! Now, draw an airplane.<br><br>Okay, so you're wondering what's the point? Are you keeping your hand nonchalantly over your sketches out of amused embarrassment? Ninety-eight percent of the adults I've worked with respond the exact same way. Their drawings look like these:<br><br>How do your drawings compare? (In my seminars, most adults would be laughing hysterically right now, especially when I have some kids' drawings on a chalkboard in front of the group!) The kids and adults are drawing on the same skill level. The house drawing above is a two-dimensional, flat symbol for a house. We all loved to draw when we were very young, but, unfortunately, the skill of drawing was not taught with a thorough, sequentially structured program such as math or reading. Our drawing skill abruptly stopped developing before our creativity had a chance to blossom.<br><br>I call these pre-test houses "McHomes" because million of people draw exactly the same symbol for a house. The same for "McPlanes." A subtle revenge against the airlines for too many delays, too much turbulence, too much lost luggage...running out of honey-roasted peanuts! We could crank out these McPlanes in no time. Just think, a lifetime supply of soggy, turkey sandwiches, vacuum-packed in plastic baggies, each served with a single leaf of lettuce, half a pickle, and a radish!<br><br>Okay, enough is enough. You're probably thinking, "Gee, what a sensitive drawing teacher." Honestly, most adults draw exactly like they did as children because that's when their artistic development stopped. But, the jokes and hysterical pointing do have a point. I'm breaking down the Creativity Crunch Syndrome! The resiliency of people is so inspiring. These same adults who laugh hysterically at their own drawings (I hope you're laughing by now!), will throw away 30, 40 and even 50 years of creativity crunching, pick up a pencil, flip over their pre-test (saving their "flat" drawings for comparison's sake), and will keep right on drawing with me! Each one walks out of my seminars with a fistful of excellent three-dimensional sketches, a positive, creative attitude, and an uncontrollable desire to buy three large sketchbooks!<br><br><b>To Teachers (society's true heroes):</b><br><br>Chapter 3 is a "Teachers' Section" where I'll outline why drawing is critical in your classroom, how drawing can be used as the hub of your curriculum, and how you can harness the enthusiasm this program generates to build each student's self-esteem. I'll share with you some "hot" classroom drawing techniques with a guarantee to extend "on task" project time. Yes, every chatterbox, eraser-throwing, tack-taping-on-chairs Johnny will sit quietly for LONG periods of time, completely engrossed in geography, social studies, math, or any subject where drawing is used as a teaching vehicle.<br><br><b>To Parents:</b><br><br>Chapter 6 is a "Parents' Section" where I'll outline activities for you to try with your children to utilize that powerhouse of creativity within them. It wouldn't hurt for you to do the activities with them. I'd also recommend that you check out the "Teachers' Section." There are some great ideas there that I don't go over in your section. But of course you'll read it; You're a 24-hour-a-day teacher!<br><br><b>To High School Students:</b><br><br>Chapter 8 is a special note for you. I tell you about my personal story of drawing success. How I've utilized drawing to visualize and achieve my dreams (one of which is this book). Use my story as an enthusiastic energizer to launch <i>your</i> dreams! Say "Yes to Drawing and No To Drugs."<br><br><b>To Kids:</b><br><br>You're about to launch into the world of drawing, a place of exciting adventure! A place where your pencil will blast across the paper to create wonderful three-dimensional drawings. Beginning with Lesson 1, I'll guide you through 30 drawing adventures. Each of these will ignite your imagination and will keep you drawing all day long. Grab your paper and pencil and get ready to Draw, Draw, Draw!<br><br><b>One Last Thought</b><br><br>Before you actually begin the lessons, let me leave you with one last thought, no, one MORE thought (I never have a final thought!). So, think about this. Visualize your progress. Eventually (sooner than you think), you'll be drawing it! So, get ready. This systematic drawing program into which you are about to plunge will be like surfing the crest of an artistic tidal wave.<br><br>You are about to taste the fruit of <i>confident</i> creativity. Bon Appetit!<br><br><b>The Draw Squad's</b><br><br><b>TEN KEY WORDS OF DRAWING</b><br><br>These Ten Key Words can be successfully combined to create the illusion of three-dimensional drawing.<br><br>This method, which has worked tremendously well in my classrooms, teaches the students fundamental drawing skills in a structured format to ensure success. I've found that the "idea launch" or the "extra button" is the motivator in getting students to use the Ten Key Words without copying my illustrations. This helps each student develop his or her own style of skilled visual expression.<br><br><b>Foreshortening</b><br><br>Distorting objects or parts of an object to create the illusion that one edge is actually closer to your eye.<br><br><b>Shading</b><br><br>Adding darkness to a surface that is opposite an imaginary light source adds depth to your drawing.<br><br><b>Surface</b><br><br>Drawing objects or parts of an object lower on the surface of the paper makes them appear closer (with the exception of objects in space i.e. birds, clouds etc.).<br><br><b>Size</b><br><br>Generally, objects drawn larger will look closer, except when overlapping.<br><br><b>Contour Lines</b><br><br>Lines wrapped around the contour of a round object adds volume and shape to the object.<br><br><b>Overlapping</b><br><br>Objects drawn in front of others will make the front objects appear closer.<br><br><b>Density</b><br><br>Images drawn darker, and with more detail, will appear closer than images drawn lighter and with less detail. This adds "atmosphere" to the drawing.<br><br><b>Shadows</b><br><br>Shadows are cast off the object from the shaded side. This anchors the object firmly onto the surface. Shadows can also be used to create an "overhang" or "hover" illusion.<br><br><b>Attitude</b><br><br>A student's self-esteem and confidence are critical elements to be nurtured when teaching any skill.

You will find no better, more convincing interpretation of these books of the Bible than right here in <i>Jesus Is Risen</i>. This is an exciting and understandable analysis you will savor and appreciate. Don't doubt me." Author: Rush Limbaugh<br><br>"I know David Limbaugh to be a man of deep faith, and never has that faith been better put to use than in this insightful examination of the early Christian Church. No other history is more demanding of our attention, and for this lay reader no one has done a better job explaining it. And on a personal note, David has been instrumental in inspiring my own faith journey, for which I am forever grateful." Author: Sean Hannity<br><br>"Freedom isn't possible without freedom in Christ, and to understand this, you need to understand the Bible. David Limbaugh has done readers a wonderful service in this Bible-baed history of the early Christian Church. It is a must-read book for anyone who wants to understand the roots of Christianity and the importance of grace." Author: Dana Loesch<br><br>"One of the greatest defenses of faith is history, and in <i>Jesus Is Risen</i>, David Limbaugh reveals the true history of the early church in a way that everyone can understand and be inspired by. Great book!" Author: David and Jason Benham<br><br>"<i>Jesus Is Risen</i> takes you on a wonderful tour of Paul's inspiring writings and Luke's historical masterpiece to unpack the most important event in human history&#x2014;the Resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. As David Limbaugh has shown in his three recent works on Christianity, he is a master at perching you high enough to give you the grand view, while also knowing when to dive deep enough to pull out helpful spiritual insights. This is a nourishing read for both the seeker and long-time Christian. Highly recommended!"

Exactly three yards from the water at exactly 11:55 p.m., 8 January 2010. Adaora came from the north side of the beach. The tall veiled man came from the east. The bloodied man wearing army fatigues from the west. They ambled in their general directions, eyeing each other as it became clear that their paths would intersect.<br> <br>Only Adaora hesitated. Then, like the others, she pressed on. She was a born-and-raised Lagosian, and she was wearing nicely fitted jeans and a sensible blouse. She&#x2019;d spent more time walking this beach than probably both of these men combined.<br> <br>She wiped the tears from her cheeks and trained her eyes straight ahead. About a quarter of a mile away was open water where the Atlantic overflowed its banks. When bad things happened, her feet always brought her here, to Lagos&#x2019;s Bar Beach.<br> <br>In many ways, Bar Beach was a perfect sample of Nigerian society. It was a place of mixing. The ocean mixed with the land, and the wealthy mixed with the poor. Bar Beach attracted drug dealers, squatters, various accents and languages, seagulls, garbage, biting flies, tourists, all kinds of religious zealots, hawkers, prostitutes, johns, water-loving children, and their careless parents. The beachside bars and small restaurants were the most popular hangout spots. Bar Beach&#x2019;s waters were too wild for any serious swimming. Even the best swimmers risked a watery death by its many rip currents.<br> <br>Adaora had removed her sandals. It was deep night, and this was probably a bad idea. So far, however, she hadn&#x2019;t stepped on any pieces of wood, rusty nails, broken glass, or sharp stones. Her need to feel the cool sand between her toes at this moment outweighed the risk. Despite its trash, there was still something sacred about Bar Beach.<br> <br>On 12 June 1993, the day of the most democratic election in Nigeria&#x2019;s history, she&#x2019;d come here with her father and watched him shed tears of joy. On 23 June, her mother brought her here because her father and uncles were at home cursing and shouting over the military annulling those same elections.<br> <br>She came here to escape the reality that her best friend was sleeping with her biology professor to earn a passing grade. On the day she received her PhD in marine biology from the University of Lagos, she came here to thank the Powers That Be for helping her stay sane enough to finish her degree (and for the fact that she hadn&#x2019;t had to sleep with anyone to earn it).<br> <br>Last year, she&#x2019;d come here to weep when her father was killed along with thirty others during a botched robbery of a luxury bus on the Lagos&#x2013;Benin Expressway, one of Nigeria&#x2019;s many, many, many dangerous roads. The thieves had demanded that all the passengers get off the bus and lie in the momentarily empty road. In their stupidity, the thieves hadn&#x2019;t anticipated the truck (speeding to avoid armed robbers) that would run over everyone including the thieves.<br> <br>And now Adaora was here at Bar Beach because her loving perfect husband of ten years had hit her. Slapped her really hard. All because of a hip-hop concert and a priest. At first, she&#x2019;d stood there stunned and hurt, cupping her cheek, praying the children hadn&#x2019;t heard. Then she&#x2019;d brought her hand up and slapped him right back. Shocked into rage, her husband leaped on her. But Adaora had been ready for him. By this time, she wasn&#x2019;t thinking about the children.<br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t know how long she and her husband had scuffled like wild dogs on the floor. And the way the fight had ended, it wasn&#x2019;t . . . normal. One minute they&#x2019;d been brawling, and then the next, her husband was mysteriously stuck to the floor, his wrists and ankles held down as though by powerful magnets. As he&#x2019;d screamed and twisted, Adaora had got up, grabbed her keys, and run out of the house. Thankfully, their Victoria Island home was only minutes from Bar Beach.<br> <br>She rubbed her swollen cheek. Even on her dark skin, the redness would be visible. She set her jaw, and tried to ignore the two men coming from her right and left as she walked toward the ocean. After what she&#x2019;d just dealt with, she wasn&#x2019;t about to let any man get in her way. Still, as she got closer, she ventured a glance at the two of them.<br> <br>She frowned.<br> <br>The man in the military uniform looked like he&#x2019;d already seen plenty plenty pepper. He reminded Adaora of a whipped lion. Blood dribbled from his nose, and he wasn&#x2019;t bothering to wipe it away. And half his face was swollen. Yet he had a hard, unshaken look in his eye. The other man was a tall, dark-skinned scarecrow of a fellow wearing a black-and-white veil. Maybe he was a Muslim. He was scrutinizing the approaching beat-up-looking soldier more than he was her.<br> <br>Each of them walked in their respective straight lines. Each heading toward each other. Adaora squinted at the man in the veil. What is it about him? she thought as she walked toward the sea. Something. But she didn&#x2019;t slow her gait. And so the three of them met. The tall man was the first to speak. &#x201c;Excuse&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell me this is a joke,&#x201d; Adaora interrupted as she realized what it was about the man. &#x201c;Are . . . are you . . . Can I ask you a . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>The tall man, looking deeply annoyed, removed his veil and sighed. &#x201c;I am,&#x201d; he said, cutting her off. &#x201c;But don&#x2019;t call me Anthony Dey Craze. I&#x2019;m just out for a post-concert stroll. Tonight, just call me Edgar.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Na woa!&#x201d; she exclaimed, laughing, reaching up to touch her throbbing cheek. &#x201c;You wore that scarf on your album cover, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; After what had happened at home, it was surprising and felt good to laugh. &#x201c;I was supposed to be at your concert tonight!&#x201d;<br> <br>At some point, her husband Chris had changed his mind about &#x201c;letting&#x201d; her go to the Anthony Dey Craze concert with her best friend Yemi because he&#x2019;d barred her way when she&#x2019;d tried to leave. &#x201c;Since when do I need your permission to do anything, anyway?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said to her husband, taken aback. Then came the slap.<br> <br>&#x201c;Please,&#x201d; the bloody military man said, snatching his green beret off his smoothly shaven head and squeezing it in his shaking hands. &#x201c;Do either of you have a mobile phone? I must call my father. I will pay you well.&#x201d;<br> <br>Adaora barely registered his words; she was now really looking him over. Up close he looked not only injured but in deep, deep distress. The blood running from his nose glistened in the dim mix of street and moonlight. She took her hand from her burning cheek and reached out to him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, buddy,&#x201d; Anthony said, looking at the military man with concern. He&#x2019;d brought out his mobile phone. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re bleeding, o! Do you need help? Are you all&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; he snapped. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not all right!&#x201d;<br> <br>Adaora jumped back, unconsciously bringing her fists up.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do I LOOK all right?&#x201d; he shouted. He motioned for Anthony&#x2019;s mobile phone. &#x201c;I need to make this phone call right now! My fam&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>BOOM!<br> <br>Anthony dropped his mobile phone as all three of them dropped to the ground, their hands over their heads. Adaora found herself looking from the bleeding military man to Anthony in terror. It was not the type of sound one heard on Bar Beach, or in any part of Lagos. On Bar Beach, the loudest thing was typically some woman shouting at a man or someone&#x2019;s old car backfiring on a nearby road. This booming sound was so deep Adaora could feel it in her chest, and it rattled her teeth. It left cotton in her ears. It was so wide that it seemed to have its own physical weight. Adaora glanced around and saw that the noise pushed everything to the ground. A few feet away, two seagulls dropped from the night sky to the sand, stunned. Something black bounced off Anthony&#x2019;s head and fell beside him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bat?&#x201d; Adaora asked. Everything was muffled, as if she were speaking underwater.<br> <br>Anthony looked at it closely. The bat was furry-bodied and beady-eyed with black wings. It wiggled a bit, still alive. He scooped up the poor creature and grabbed Adaora&#x2019;s hand. He nudged the military man&#x2019;s shoulder as he cradled the stunned animal.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;That came from the water! We should get away from here!&#x201d;<br> <br>But something was happening to the ocean. The waves were roiling irregularly. Each time the waves broke on the beach, they reached farther and farther up the sand. Then a four-foot wave rose up. Adaora was so fascinated that she just stood there staring. Anthony stopped pulling her and pushing the military man. Blood ran into the military man&#x2019;s eyes as he tried to focus his gaze on the darkness of the water. The wave was heading right for them. Fast and quiet as a whisper. It was closer to ten feet tall now. Finally, the three of them turned and ran. The fist of water was faster. Adaora grabbed the military man&#x2019;s hand. Anthony threw the bat to what he hoped was safety, leaped, and grabbed Adaora&#x2019;s legs just as the water fell at them.<br> <br>PLASH!<br> <br>The salty water stung Adaora&#x2019;s eyes and pulled at her garments as it sucked her toward the sea. Her hands scrambled at the sand as it collapsed beneath her, the pebbles raking at her skin, the sea sucking at her legs. She could still feel the desperate grasp of the military man&#x2019;s hand and Anthony&#x2019;s arms around her legs. She wasn&#x2019;t alone. In the blackness, she could see some of the lights from the bars and the nearby buildings. They were flickering and growing smaller and smaller.<br> <br>Bubbles tickled her ears as she tried to twist to the surface. But it was as if the ocean had opened its great maw and swallowed her and the two men. She couldn&#x2019;t breathe. She heard bubbles and the roar and rush of water against her ears. And she could feel the tightness of her laboring lungs and the suction of the water. Aman iman, Adaora weakly thought. The phrase meant &#x201c;water is life&#x201d; in the Tuareg language of Tamashek. She&#x2019;d once worked with a Tuareg man on a diving expedition. &#x201c;Aman Iman,&#x201d; had been his answer when Adaora asked how a man of the Sahara Desert had become an expert scuba diver. Despite the pain in her lungs now and the swallowing darkness, she smiled. Aman Iman.<br> <br>The three of them grasped each other. Down, down, down, they went.</p><h2>The Pharaoh Key (Gideon Crew Series)</h2><p><b>Don't miss the this exciting, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling adventure from Preston &amp; Child, in which the secrets of a mysterious ancient tablet may point the way to untold treasure--or unspeakable danger.</b> <b><br></b> <i>"I just want to be crystal clear about this: if it has value, we're gonna steal it. Are you with me?"</i> <em></em> <b></b> Effective Engineering Solutions has been inexplicably shut down and the head of the company, Eli Glinn, has all but vanished. Fresh off a diagnosis that gives him only months to live, Gideon Crew is contacted by one of his coworkers at EES, Manuel Garza, who tells him the two have mere hours to collect their belongings before the office closes forever. After years of dedicated service and several high-risk missions, theirs seems like the most ignoble of terminations-until Gideon and Garza happen upon an incredible discovery. After centuries of silence, a code-breaking machine at EES has cracked the long-awaited translation of a centuries-old stone tablet, the Phaistos Disc, that dates back to an otherwise completely unknown, ancient civilization. The mysteries of the message itself hint at incredible treasures, and perhaps even a world-altering secret. No one remains at EES to take on this most remarkable mission but Gideon and Garza. The two agree to solve the mystery of the disc's message and split the spoils: the perfect parting gift their employer doesn't know he has given. What lies at the end of the trail may save Gideon's life-or bring it to a sudden, shocking close. As Gideon and Garza soon discover, some missions are more dangerous than others. But as Gideon has proved again and again, there's no such thing as too great a risk when you're living on borrowed time.</p><p>The thrillers of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child "stand head and shoulders above their rivals" (<em>Publishers Weekly</em>).

He died in January 2010.<b>1</b> <p> After the murder, they made love in front of a video camera. When it was over, her mouth was bruised. He had long scratches across his back. They lay side by side on their backs, gasping for breath. </p><p> "Jesus!" he said, his voice hoarse. </p><p> "Yes," she whispered. </p><p> She moved into the compass of his left arm and rested her head against his chest. They lay silently for a while, not moving, waiting for oxygen. </p><p> "I love you," he said. </p><p> "I love you too," she said. </p><p> He put his face down against the top of her head where it lay on his chest. Her hair smelled of verbena. In time their breathing settled. </p><p> "Let's play the video," she whispered. </p><p> "Let's," he said. </p><p> The camera stood beside the bed on a tripod. He got up, took the tape from it, put it in the VCR, got back into bed, and picked up the remote from the night table. She moved back into the circle of his arm, her head back on his chest. </p><p> "Show time," he said, and clicked the remote. </p><p> They watched. </p><p> "My God," she said. "Look at me." </p><p> "I love how you're looking right into the camera," he said. </p><p> They watched quietly for a little while. </p><p> "Whoa," she said. "What are you doing to me there?" </p><p> "Nothing you don't like," he said. </p><p> When the tape was over he rewound it. </p><p> "You want to watch again?" he said. </p><p> She was drawing tiny circles on his chest with her left forefinger. </p><p> "Yes." </p><p> He started the tape again. </p><p> "You know what I loved," she said.

That is, until he undergoes a radical personality shift during a bloody military action in the Balkans. Now it's just three weeks before the election and Marlon is suddenly talking about "issues" and "reform" as he crosses the length and breadth of his home state with an amnesiac speechwriter and a chief of staff who turns catatonic in the presence of minorities. The governor's new-found conscience might well cost him the election, though. And it appears that pretty much everybody from Tallahassee to Miami Beach is trying to kill him...</p></p><p>Maybe you can't be too outrageous when the subject is Florida politics, but Tim Dorsey (<i>Florida Roadkill</i>, <i>Hammerhead Ranch Motel</i>) manages to go so far over the top in this satirical page burner that even diehard fans of Carl Hiaasen, Laurence Shames, and Dave Barry may find their patience wearing thin after the first couple of chapters. When Republican Governor Marlon Conrad is inexplicably called up by the reserve unit he joined for a reelection photo-op and sent to Bosnia, he suffers a midlife crisis that has his campaign staff totally flummoxed. Not that they're playing with a full deck either; Conrad's closest adviser is a crazed serial killer who happens to be an expert in Florida folklore, and the rest of the boys on the bus--the Orange Crush, Marlon's joyride across the Sunshine State--aren't much saner.<p> While Conrad's the main character, there are enough second-string oddballs to keep this road trip going until the denouement, a bizarre debate between the governor and his opponent, Gomer Tatum, whose idea of intelligent political discourse is a WWF death match. They include Helmut Von Zeppelin, a multimillionaire who owns most of the politicians in Florida; Jackie Monroeville, a trailer queen determined to get her man into the governor's mansion; and Gottfried Escrow, Marlon's chief of staff. There's plenty of mayhem but not much mystery in this comic novel that proves there can be too much of a good thing. While Dorsey keeps the belly laughs coming, he doesn't stop long enough for the reader to give much of a hoot about any of his characters, much less root for the good guys to win. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><p>Tim Dorsey was a reporter and editor for the Tampa Tribune from 1987 to 1999, and is the author of twenty-one novels: <em>Pope of Palm Beach, Clownfish Blues, Coconut Cowboy, Shark Skin Suite, Tiger Shrimp Tango, The Riptide Ultra-Glide, When Elves Attack, Pineapple Grenade, Electric Barracuda, Gator A-Go-Go, Nuclear Jellyfish, Atomic Lobster, Hurricane Punch, The Big Bamboo, Torpedo Juice, Cadillac Beach, The Stingray Shuffle, Triggerfish Twist, Orange Crush, Hammerhead Ranch Motel</em>, and <em>Florida Roadkill</em>.

The story of the emergence of a hero, a paean to the Irish landscape, and a bawdy and contentious marital farce, <i>The Tain</i>&nbsp;tells of a great cattle-raid, the invasion of Ulster by the armies of Medb and Ailill, Queen and King of Connacht, and their allies, seeking to carry off the great Brown Bull of Cualige. The hero of the tale is Cuchulainn, the Hound of Ulster, who resists the invaders single-handed while Ulster's warriors lie sick. In its first translation in forty years, Ciaran Carson brings this seminal work of Irish literature fully to life, capturing all of its visceral power in what acclaimed poets Seamus Heaney and Paul Muldoon individually called one of the best books of the year.&nbsp;<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

His poetry collections include <i>The New Estate; The Irish for No, Belfast Confetti</i>, which won the Irish Book Award and was shortlisted for the Whitbread Prize; <i>First Language</i>, which won the T.S. Eliot Prize; <i>Opera et Cetera</i>, which was a UK Poetry Book Society Choice; and <i>The Twelfth of Never</i> and<i> The Ballad of HMS Belfast</i>. He has written two prose books, <i>The Pocket Guide to Irish Traditional Music</i> and<i> Last Night's Fun</i> and one novel, <i>Shamrock Tea</i>. He is a member of Aosd�na and lives in Belfast.Loosely translated as The Cattle Raid of Cooley, the <i>T�in B� C�ailnge</i> is part of the 80-story, multiauthor Ulster Cycle, an Irish epic that dates to the eighth century. Rendered in laconic vernacular prose by veteran poet and translator Carson, <i>The T�in</i> (pronounced toyne) opens on the pillow talk of King Ailill of Connacht and his boastful wife, Queen Mebd. Reckoning that her husband has one greater asset than she, namely, the prize white-horned bull, Finnbennach, the queen enlists the entire army of Connacht to wage war against C�ailnge, a province of Ulster, in order to secure its fine brown bull. As the army moves into Ulster, it is led by Fergus, a former king of Ulster now in exile who remains sympathetic to the Ulster side and to his 17-year-old foster son, C� Chulainn, whose youthful exploits Fergus recounts. Three-day hand-to-hand combat pits C� Chulainn against his beloved foster-brother, Fer Diad Mac Dam�in; at the climax, the white and brown bulls come face to face. The narrative revels in place names and their etymologies, telling story upon story. Carson's version is a lively and vivid journey through a mythic landscape. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Residence:&nbsp;MassachusettsAt the start of bestseller Salvatore&#39;s second book in his Tolkienesque fantasy trilogy (after 2002&#39;s The Thousand Orcs), hordes of orcs, led by cruel King Obould Many-Arrows, sweep down mechanically and unexcitingly on beleaguered dwarves. When he isn&#39;t slaying orcs, the story&#39;s hero, the dark elf drow loner Drizzt Do&#39;Urden, suffers guilt for allowing a friendly elf to die in his stead and is attracted to Catti-brie, a beautiful human woman who is the ward of the dying dwarf king, Bruenor Battlehammer. The usual fantasy suspects-gnomes, trolls, elves, flying horses, unicorns, giants-crowd the pages, but the author does at times rise above cliche, and a few characters do achieve some complexity. Obould actually speaks of economics, while an elf, Innovindel, having lost her mate in battle, talks pensively of the centuries of her life, in contrast to the paltry few years of human life. This difference is significant to Drizzt, because Catti-brie is only human.

His list of achievements and championships would fill pages.<br><br>But how does he do it? In <strong>HOW I PLAY GOLF</strong>, through fabulous color photos, slow-motion photography, and plenty of text, Tiger talks about his drives, his putting, his chip shots, his mental approach to the game, and much more more. This is the complete instructional on how Tiger plays the game of golf.<br><br>Tiger shares his thoughts on what he calls the game for a lifetime. He reveals the five secrets he believes are responsible for his success -- a combination of physical, metaphysical, and psychological practices he uses daily to keep his game in top shape and to help him to transcend all the ups and downs of golf. <br><br>Not many can play golf as well as Tiger does, but at least we can read how we can try to improve our game. This one singular volume contains all the golf instruction that anyone would ever need.</p><p>No athlete has changed his sport the way Tiger Woods has transformed the world of golf. The Tiger phenomenon has created a new legion of golfers, seduced by Woods's almost effortless mastery of this most difficult game. In <i>How I Play Golf</i> Woods reveals the many facets of his game and offers a plethora of tips and advice aimed at all levels of play. Unlike most golf guides, and perhaps somewhat surprising from a player best known for his long game, <i>How I Play Golf</i> begins with the short game--putting, chipping, and pitching--before moving onto swing mechanics and hitting off the tee. Produced in conjunction with the editors of <i>Golf Digest</i>, the book is lavishly photographed and illustrated and offers a gold mine of useful ideas and mental images Tiger has collected over the years. Throughout, Tiger recounts memorable shots from his relatively brief career; for example, his only "perfect" shot (a 3-wood on No. 14 at St. Andrews) and his first putt at the 1995 Masters (a 20-footer for birdie on No. 1 that missed and rolled off the green). <i>How I Play Golf</i> is not only a first-rate instructional guide, it also communicates a passion and respect for the game that beginners, hackers, and low handicappers should find inspiring. Highly recommended. <i>--Harry C. Edwards</i>Tiger Woods became the youngest player ever to complete the career Grand Slam of professional major championships and only the fifth ever to do so, following the likes of Jack Nicklaus. He was also the youngest Masters champion ever, at the age of 21. <br><br>He is the career victories leader among active players on the PGA tour with 71 wins. Tiger needs only to win four more major championships to tie Jack Nicklaus for the lifetime career record (Nicklaus has 18).</p><h2>The Wellspring of Worship</h2><p>The Sacred Liturgy, declares Vatican II, is the font from which all the Church's spiritual power flows. In his modern classic work The Wellspring of Worship, Fr. Jean Corbon explores the meaning of the Liturgy as the "wellspring" or source of the Church's life and worship of God. The Liturgy itself is a sharing in the mystery of the Triune God and in the Incarnation, Passion, Death, Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus. Corbon writes that it is "the mystery of the river of life that streams from the Father and the Lamb", into which believers are to be drawn. In this way, the divine river waters their entire lives, renewing and transforming them. <p>The Wellspring of Worship is a masterful reflection on the mystery of God's Trinitarian life and how the Church's members participate in that life through the Liturgy.</p></p><p>Text: English, French (translation)"I have no doubt that this book will be recognized for centuries as a classic of Catholic liturgical spirituality and theology." --<strong> Aidan Nichols, O.P.</strong>,Author, <i>Looking at the Liturgy</i></p><h2>Thyroid Healthy: Lose Weight, Look Beautiful and Live the Life You Imagine</h2><p>Live Thyroid Healthy and put an end to: Chronic fatigue Constipation Cold hands and feet Brain fog Hair loss Excessive weight Depression and anxiety Are you one of the millions who s fallen through the cracks of the standard medical system?

Wandering the streets of Tokyo and scribbling madly on the interior walls of his box, he describes the world outside as he sees or perhaps imagines it, a tenuous reality that seems to include a mysterious rifleman determined to shoot him, a seductive young nurse, and a doctor who wants to become a box man himself. <b>The Box Man</b> is a marvel of sheer originality and a bizarrely fascinating fable about the very nature of identity.<br><br>Translated from the Japanese by E.

In this, with case studies of schizophrenic patients, he succeeds brilliantly, but he does more: through a vision of sanity and madness as 'degrees of conjunction and disjunction between two persons where the one is sane by common consent' he offers a rich existential analysis of personal alienation. <p>The outsider, estranged from himself and society, cannot experience either himself or others as 'real'. He invents a false self and with it he confronts both the outside world and his own despair. The disintegration of his real self keeps pace with the growing unreality of his false self until, in the extremes of schizophrenic breakdown, the whole personality disintegrates.<br><br></p></p><p><b>R.D. Laing</b>, one of the best-known psychiatrists of modern times, was born in Glasgow in 1927 and graduated from Glasgow University as a doctor of medicine. In the 1960's he developed the argument that there may be a benefit in allowing acute mental and emotional turmoil in depth to go on and have its way, and that the outcome of such turmoil could have a positive value. He was the first to put such a stand to the test by establishing, with others, residences where persons could live and be free to let happen what will when the acute psychosis is given free rein, or where, at the very least, they receive no treatment they do not want. This work with the Philadelphia Association since 1964, together with his focus on disturbed and disturbing types of interaction in institutions, groups and families, has been both influential and continually controversial.<p>R.D. Laing's writings range from books on social theory to verse, as well as numerous articles and reviews in scientific journals and the popular press. His publications are: <b>The Divided Self</b>, <b>Self and Others</b>, <b>Interpersonal Perception</b> (with H. Phillipson and A. Robin Lee), <b>Reason and Violence</b> (introduced by Jean-Paul Sartre), <b>Sanity, Madness and the Family</b> (with A. Esterson), <b>The Politics of Experience</b> and <b>The Bird of Paradise</b>, <b>Knots</b>, <b>The Politics of the Family</b>, <b>The Facts of Life</b>, <b>Do You Love Me?</b>, <b>Conversations with Children</b>, <b>Sonnets</b>, <b>The Voice of Experience</b> and <b>Wisdom, Madness and Folly</b>.</p><p>R.D. Laing died in 1989. Anthony Clare, writing in the <b>Guardian</b>, said of him: "His major achievement was that he dragged the isolated and neglected inner world of the severely psychotic individual out of the back ward of the large gloomy mental hospital and on to the front pages of influential newspapers, journals and literary magazines . . . Everyone in contemporary psychiatry owes something to R.D. Laing."</p><p></p>"Dr. Laing is saying something very important indeed. . . . This is a truly humanist approach."<br> &#x2014;Philip toynbee in the <b>Observer</b><p>"It is a study that makes all other works I have read on schizophrenia seem fragmentary. . . . The author brings, through his vision and perception, that particular touch of genius which causes one to say Yes, I have always known that, why have I never thought of it before?'"<br> &#x2014;<b>Journal of Analytical Psychology</b></p></p><h2>Dear Church: A Love Letter from a Black Preacher to the Whitest Denomination in the US</h2><p><p>Lenny Duncan is the unlikeliest of pastors. Formerly incarcerated, he is now a black preacher in the whitest denomination in the United States: the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). Shifting demographics and shrinking congregations make all the headlines, but Duncan sees something else at work--drawing a direct line between the church's lack of diversity and the church's lack of vitality. The problems the ELCA faces are theological, not sociological. But so are the answers.</p><p>Part manifesto, part confession, and all love letter, <i>Dear Church</i> offers a bold new vision for the future of Duncan's denomination and the broader mainline Christian community of faith. <i>Dear Church</i> rejects the narrative of church decline and calls everyone--leaders and laity alike--to the front lines of the church's renewal through racial equality and justice.</p><p>It is time for the church to rise up, dust itself off, and take on forces of this world that act against God: whiteness, misogyny, nationalism, homophobia, and economic injustice. Duncan gives a blueprint for the way forward and urges us to follow in the revolutionary path of Jesus.</p><p><i>Dear Church</i> also features a discussion guide at the back--perfect for church groups, book clubs, and other group discussion.</p></p><p><p><b>Lenny Duncan</b> is pastor of Jehu's Table, a church in the heart of Brooklyn. Formerly incarcerated, formerly homeless, and formerly unchurched, Duncan is now a sought-after speaker and writer on topics of racial justice and the role of the church in the twenty-first century. His documentary film, <i>Do Black Churches Matter in the ELCA</i>, was released in 2017.</p><br>"Rev. Lenny Duncan is a voice calling in the wilderness. I am deeply grateful for the comfort and the discomfort his book brought me. I dare you to read this book, church. I dare you to be open to the repentance it calls for, to the grace it manifests, to the pain it witnesses to. I dare you to be changed by the truth in its pages. I dare you to not look away. It's time." --Nadia Bolz-Weber, Pastor and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Shameless: A Sexual Revolution</i><br> <br>"Our brother Lenny Duncan has crafted a masterful and heartbroken indictment of where the Lutheran Church could be and where it is instead. He stands fiercely grounded in the Lutheran tradition of revealing our own brokenness, proclaiming our hope in Christ, and challenging us to live into love of neighbor. His individual experiences and our churchwide practices are woven together in an unsettling illustration of how the American idol of white supremacy has laid the foundation for a wide array of vitriol, from Dylann Roof to transphobia to the election of the forty-fifth president. Prepare yourself, church. This is a love letter you have to read--and a proclamation that will leave you convicted." --Emmy Kegler ELCA Pastor and author of <i>One Coin Found</i><br> <br>"May we love the church as much as Duncan does so that we cannot just take his words to heart but also engage to dismantle the powers and principalities that keep us from being siblings in Christ with one another. His words about the whitest denomination in the United States and its relationship to white supremacy are the truths that we need to acknowledge. Duncan's love letter to the church is the modern day epistle we all need to read." --The Reverend Tuhina Verma Rasche<br> <br>"Marrying stunning, reverberant personal stories with little-known Lutheran history, Duncan makes readers laugh out loud in grim recognition. His critiques of our beloved church strike a tender spot in the heart, not because they are harsh, but because they are true. I pray we will engage in truth-telling with the same rigor Duncan does, because only truth will open the path to justice." --Emily Scott, ELCA Mission Developer and Dinner Church Movement<br> <br>"Lenny Duncan has given us a bold and fearless book filled with unsettling but indispensable insights into the stranglehold white supremacy inflicts upon our churches. At the same time, we feel a holy, ferocious love radiating from every page. This book should be required reading for all who love our church and lament our failures. If you don't come away breathless, hope-struck, and fired up for revolution, check your pulse." --Heidi Neumark, Trinity Lutheran Church Manhattan<br> <br>"The Reverend Lenny Duncan writes with a searing message urgently rooted in true love. His deep commitment to speak the truth to his white siblings in the church reads as a desperately clarion call. <i>Dear Church</i> isn&#x2019;t just a good idea for a book study--the grace-filled ferocity that overwhelms its pages reminds one of early writings from the Latin American base communities that formed liberation theology as we know it today. Duncan has written a necessary addition to the corpus of Christian writings in the twenty-first century. We ignore his plea at our own peril." --Jason Chesnutt ANKOS Films, The Slate Project and #slatespeak and #slatereads<br></p><h2>Key of Light</h2><p><b>#1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Nora Roberts opens the door to one woman&#x2019;s search for truth and passion in the first Key Trilogy novel.&nbsp;</b><br><br> Malory Price&#x2019;s life plan has hit a snag.

Out of that experience came Red Star Over China, a classic work that remains one of the most important books ever written about the birth of the Communist movement in China. This edition includes extensive notes on military and political developments in China, further interviews with Mao Tse-tung, a chronology covering 125 years of Chinese revolution, and nearly a hundred detailed biographies of the men and women who were instrumental in making China what it is today.</p><p>&#x201c;A journalistic scoop in 1937, this book has since become a historical classic. When Snow made his way through Nationalist lines to the barren reaches of Shensi Province in June 1936, the communists had only recently emerged, exhausted and decimated, from their 6,000-mile Long March. Snow found them developing the distinctive brand of communism that governed the lives of the Chinese people during the Maoist era and that only in recent years has begun to change under the impact of Deng Xiaoping's reforms. Many of the men Snow interviewed in 1936 were the first- generation leaders of communist China. The best-known section of the book is Mao's autobiography as related to Snow, which is still one of the most important documents on that subject. Another important section is the graphic description of the Long March. Snow's sympathetic portrayal of the Chinese communists is somewhat naive, however, and it exposed him to widespread criticism during the McCarthy years.&#x201d;&#x2015;Donald Zagoria, <i>Foreign Affairs</i></p><h2>Sadhana, a Way to God: Christian Exercises in Eastern Form</h2><p><p><b>Christian Exercises in Eastern Form</b><br><br>Truly a one-of-a-kind, how-to-do-it book, this small volume responds to a very real hunger for self-awareness and holistic living.

This is an amazing travelogue.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i></b><br><br>At the age of forty-eight, on the verge of a divorce, Rita Golden Gelman left an elegant life in L.A. to follow her dream of travelling the world, connecting with people in cultures all over the globe.<br><br>In 1986, Rita sold her possessions and became a nomad, living in a Zapotec village in Mexico, sleeping with sea lions on the Galapagos Islands, and residing everywhere from thatched huts to regal palaces. She has observed orangutans in the rain forest of Borneo, visited trance healers and dens of black magic, and cooked with women on fires all over the world. Rita&#x2019;s example encourages us all to dust off our dreams and rediscover the joy, the exuberance, and the hidden spirit that so many of us bury when we become adults.</p><p>When Rita Golden Gelman traveled to Mexico during a two-month separation from her husband, she hoped to satisfy an old craving for adventure and, in the process, rejuvenate herself and her marriage. Little did she know it was the beginning of a new life, not just as a divorc�e, but as a nomad of the world. Since 1986, Gelman has had no permanent address and no possessions except those she can carry. She travels without a plan, guided by instinct, serendipitous opportunities, and a remarkable ability to connect with people. At first her family and friends accused her of running away, but Gelman knew she had embarked on a journey of self-discovery and a way of life that is inspiring and enviable.<p> We know Gelman is not your typical middle-aged housewife from LA when, on that first trip to Mexico, she randomly picks a Zapotec village and decides to live there for a month, knowing nothing about the culture or the language. When she arrives, the villagers run away from her, terrified. By the time she leaves, there are hugs and tears. From there she travels to Guatemala and Nicaragua, Israel and the Galapagos Islands. But the heart of the book--and her 15-year journey--is Indonesia, where she lives for eight years. It is Bali that forever changes how she looks at the world, facilitated by her friendship with an aging prince. Tu Aji not only invites her to live with his family but decides that the education of Rita will be his final duty in life. Wherever she goes, Gelman has an uncanny ability to slip into other ways of life and become part of a community. And she is a person for whom doors open widely--her seatmate on the plane to Bali scrawls the prince's name on a piece of paper, she talks her way into a sojourn at Camp Leakey in Borneo where orangutans are studied, and an entire village in a remote part of Irian Jaya prays for the clouds to clear so her plane can land--and they do! Gelmen's secret is her passion for people. That being the case, the book is short on descriptions of place, but long on the rarer inside view of the peoples and customs of those places. This in itself is treat enough, but Gelman's animated and intimate story comes with a kicker--it's never too late to fulfill those dreams. <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p>"I move throughout the world without a plan, guided by instinct, connecting through trust, and constantly watching for serendipitous opportunities." --From the Preface <br>Tales of a Female Nomad is the story of Rita Golden Gelman, an ordinary woman who is living an extraordinary existence.

For his listeners then, and for his readers now, he wanted to "introduce a certain coherence into the major concepts on which psycho-analysis is based," namely, <em>the unconscious, repetition, the transference, and the drive</em>. Along the way he argues for a structural affinity between psychoanalysis and language, discusses the relation of psychoanalysis to religion, and reveals his particular stance on topics ranging from sexuality and death to alienation and repression.

This volume is based on a year&#39;s seminar, which is of particular importance because he was addressing a larger, less specialist audience than ever before, amongst whom he could not assume familiarity with his work. For his listeners then, and for his readers now, he wanted &#34;to introduce a certain coherence into the major concepts on which psycho-analysis is based&#34;, namely the unconscious, repetition, the transference and the drive.In re-defining these four concepts he explores the question that, as he puts it, moves from &#34;Is psycho-analysis a science?&#34; to &#34;What is a science that includes psycho-analysis?&#34; Dr Lacan argues in particular that there is a structural affinity between psycho-analysis, construed as the science of the unconscious, and language - the science of linguistics being one of the significant discoveries of our time. He also discusses the relation of psycho-analysis to religion, and reveals his particular stance on a wide range of topics, such as sexuality and death, love and libido, alienation, interpretation, repression and desire.This book constitutes the essence of Dr Lacan&#39;s sensibility. There is no clearer statement of the ideas and issues which have aroused such passionate reactions in France, and which can now gain the hearing they deserve in the English-speaking world.</p><h2>Dark Harbor (A Stone Barrington Novel)</h2><p><b>In this perfect mix of sexy intrigue and swift suspense in the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series, Stone Barrington investigates the suicide of a CIA officer&#x2014;his own cousin...</b><br><br>Stone Barrington hasn&#x2019;t heard from his cousin, Dick Stone, in years.

It was unlike his former NYPD partner, now the lieutenant in charge of the detective squad at the 19th Precinct, to be late for eating or drinking. Stone was signaling a waiter for another drink and a menu when Dino trudged in.</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you trudging?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m trudging because I&#x2019;m depressed,&#x201d; Dino said, waving at a waiter and making drinking motions.</p><p>&#x201c;And why, pray tell, are you depressed?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mary Ann and I have just split.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, sure,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Just sleep on the sofa tonight, and everything will be fine in the morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not this time,&#x201d; Dino replied, drinking greedily from the glass set before him. &#x201c;Words were spoken that can&#x2019;t be taken back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Take it from a lawyer,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;the only words spoken that can&#x2019;t be taken back are &#x2018;Guilty, Your Honor.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Those were pretty much the words,&#x201d; Dino said.</p><p>&#x201c;And who spoke them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who the fuck do you think?&#x201d; Dino asked. &#x201c;You think she would ever cop to anything?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What did you plead guilty to?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To the new desk sergeant at the precinct.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone&#x2019;s eyebrows went up. &#x201c;Dino, are you switch-hitting these days?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A girl desk sergeant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So the sofa is not an option?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nah. I guess I&#x2019;m moving in with you.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone blinked loudly.</p><p>&#x201c;Relax. It&#x2019;s only &#x2019;til I can find a place.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stay as long as you like, Dino,&#x201d; Stone said, patting his arm and hoping to God it wouldn&#x2019;t be more than a day or two before Mary Ann relented and let him back in the house.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, pal, I appreciate it.&#x201d; Dino nodded toward the door. &#x201c;Look who&#x2019;s coming.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone looked toward the door to find Lance Cabot and Holly Barker approaching.</p><p>&#x201c;May we join you?&#x201d; Lance asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; Stone waved them to chairs. Lance was in charge of some sort of New York CIA unit that Stone didn&#x2019;t really understand, and Holly had left her job as a chief of police in a small Florida town to work for him. Both Stone and Dino were contract &#x201c;consultants,&#x201d; and Stone didn&#x2019;t really understand that, either, except that Lance sometimes asked him to do legal stuff. Stone and Holly were, occasionally, an item.</p><p>Lance ordered drinks.</p><p>&#x201c;Why do I perceive that this isn&#x2019;t a social visit?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Because your perceptions are very keen,&#x201d; Lance replied.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me everything you know about Richard Stone.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone blinked. It was the second time that day that Dick Stone&#x2019;s name had come up. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s my first cousin,&#x201d; Stone replied.</p><p>&#x201c;I said everything you know,&#x201d; Lance pointed out.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, he&#x2019;s the son of my mother&#x2019;s older brother, now deceased; he grew up in Boston, went to Harvard and Harvard Law. I think he&#x2019;s something at the State Department.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How long since you&#x2019;ve seen him?&#x201d;</p><p>Stone thought about it. &#x201c;We had dinner eight, nine years ago, when I was still a cop. Last time before that was a little more than twenty years ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you know him as a boy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, let me tell you about it. The summer after I graduated from high school my parents sat me down and told me I was going to spend the summer in Maine with some relatives of hers. This came as a surprise, because my mother&#x2019;s relatives had stopped speaking to her years before I was born, because she had married my father, who had been disowned by his family, because he was a Communist. He didn&#x2019;t seem too happy about my spending the summer with a bunch of Stones.&#x201d;</p><p>MALON BARRINGTON WAS, indeed, unhappy. &#x201c;Why would you want your son to spend ten minutes with those plutocratic sons of bitches, let alone a whole summer?&#x201d; he asked his wife.</p><p>&#x201c;Because Richard was my brother, and Caleb and Dick Jr. are Stone&#x2019;s cousins, and he ought to take advantage of the opportunity to get to know them,&#x201d; Matilda Stone replied. &#x201c;They have that very nice place on Islesboro, in Penobscot Bay, and it&#x2019;s a wonderful place to spend a summer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stone was going to work for me in the shop,&#x201d; Malon said. Malon was a maker of fine furniture and cabinets.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to have to hire somebody when Stone goes to NYU in the fall anyway,&#x201d; Matilda said, &#x201c;so it might as well be now as then.&#x201d;</p><p>Malon made a disgruntled noise.</p><p>Matilda got down an atlas and found Maine. &#x201c;Here,&#x201d; she said, tapping her finger on a large body of water. &#x201c;This is Penobscot Bay, the largest bay in Maine, and this long, skinny island is Islesboro. The Stones live here, in the village of Dark Harbor. I spent a couple of summers there in their big, drafty old house, which isn&#x2019;t insulated. It&#x2019;s one of those rambling summer &#x2018;cottages&#x2019; that&#x2019;s unusable before June or after Labor Day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds swell,&#x201d; Stone said dryly.</p><p>&#x201c;AND THAT WAS IT,&#x201d; Stone said to Lance. &#x201c;I took a train to Bangor, where I was met by a retainer in a 1938 Ford station wagon. We drove to Lincolnville, then took a twenty-minute ferry ride to Islesboro.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dick had a brother named Caleb?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. He was two years older than Dick, who was my age, and Caleb was a pain in the ass; he was a bully and a general all-round shit. Dick was a nice guy: smart, good in school, good athlete. All Caleb ever did in school was wrestle, and he liked nothing better than to grab Dick or me and get us in some sort of stranglehold. This went on until the day I kicked him in the balls and broke his nose with an uppercut. His mother almost sent me back to New York. When I left after Labor Day, she made it pretty clear that I wouldn&#x2019;t be invited back, and I wasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What did you do that summer?&#x201d; Lance asked.</p><p>&#x201c;We sailed and played golf and tennis. The Stones lived near the yacht club, and there was a nine-hole golf course and a tennis club. We didn&#x2019;t lack for activity.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you and Dick keep in touch?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We exchanged a few letters over the next year or two, but that petered out. I didn&#x2019;t hear from him again until he turned up in New York and called me at the precinct and invited me to dinner. We went to the Harvard Club, I remember, and I was impressed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What did you talk about that evening?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;About our work: He was stationed in Rome, as I recall&#x2014;he was the agricultural attach�, or something&#x2014;and I was working homicides with Dino. I remember he asked me if I was interested in government service, and I said I was already in government service. I asked him what he had in mind, but he was vague. I didn&#x2019;t hear from him again until this morning.&#x201d;</p><p>Lance nearly choked on his drink. &#x201c;This morning?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I had a letter from Dick&#x2014;a package, really&#x2014;by FedEx. There was a letter saying that he wanted me to put the package, which was sealed, in my safe and not to open it, except in event of his death. There was a check for a thousand dollars, too, as a retainer. He wanted to formally hire me as his attorney. Why do you find it so odd that I heard from him this morning?&#x201d;</p><p>Lance put a hand on Stone&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Because, my friend, yesterday your cousin, Dick Stone, shot his wife and only daughter, then put a bullet in his own brain. At his house in Dark Harbor.&#x201d;</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>STONE UNLOCKED THE front door of his house and let everybody in. &#x201c;Dino, put your stuff on the elevator, take it up to the third floor and put it in the big guest room. We&#x2019;ll be in my office.&#x201d; Dino complied.</p><p>Stone led the way downstairs to the basement and switched on the lights in his office. &#x201c;Have a seat,&#x201d; he said to Lance and Holly. They did so. Stone went to his safe, punched the combination into the electronic keypad, removed a package and set it on his desk.</p><p>Lance bent over and looked at the package, then smiled. &#x201c;Smart boy, Dick.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Look at how he&#x2019;s done this: The package is one large sheet of heavy paper, cut so that four corners come together and are sealed with wax and Dick&#x2019;s signet ring.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s impossible to open and reseal the package without his ring and without being detected. I think you should draw up a document saying that Holly, Dino and I witnessed your opening the package.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay by me,&#x201d; Dino said, joining them.</p><p>Stone switched on his computer, typed out a brief statement, and the three of them witnessed his breaking the seals and opening the package. Then Stone put the package back into his safe and locked it.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; Lance asked.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s your turn to answer some questions,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;What is your interest in my cousin Dick?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have to answer your questions, Stone,&#x201d; Lance said.</p><p>&#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t have to show you what&#x2019;s in Dick&#x2019;s package,&#x201d; Stone replied.</p><p>&#x201c;All right, I guess we&#x2019;re all family here,&#x201d; Lance said. &#x201c;Dick Stone wasn&#x2019;t with the State Department. Until recently, he was Assistant Deputy Director for European Operations for the CIA. Two weeks ago, he arrived with his family in Washington to replace Hugh English as Deputy Director for Operations&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the top job on the operations side, reporting to the Director of Central Intelligence. After thirty years on the job, Hugh is retiring at the end of the summer. You remember when you and I met in London a couple of years ago?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was working for Dick at the time. I&#x2019;ve been assigned to investigate the deaths of him and his family.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;now everybody go sit in my waiting room while I read what&#x2019;s in the package.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Lance asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m representing Dick as his attorney and what passes between us is confidential, unless I determine that it doesn&#x2019;t need to be.&#x201d;</p><p>Lance stared at him for a moment, then got up and left the room, followed by Holly.</p><p>&#x201c;You, too, Dino,&#x201d; Stone said. Dino got up and left the room.</p><p>Stone opened the safe, took out the package and spread its four flaps. On top there was a letter from Dick Stone and beneath was a will. Stone read the letter:</p><p>My Dear Stone,</p><p>First of all, I wish to hire you as my attorney, and I enclose a check for $1,000.00 as a retainer. Of course, I know that your fees will surpass that amount, should I require services, but that will be taken care of in due course.</p><p>Barbara and I have written a will, which is enclosed, and I have had it properly witnessed by four people, whose names and addresses are noted. I have appointed you as our sole executor and, should it be necessary, guardian for our minor daughter, Esme, who is now eighteen, until she reaches her majority. She is entering Oxford this fall. I have also appointed you as her trustee, as she stands to inherit a lot of money if Barbara and I should both walk in front of the same oncoming bus.</p><p>You will note that, apart from a few bequests to distant relatives on Barbara&#x2019;s side of the family, there are none to members of my family. My only close relatives are Caleb, his wife and their twin sons, now twenty-one years old and seniors at Yale this fall. I have specifically excluded them from inheriting any of my property. I have provided for our caretaker in Dark Harbor, Seth Hotchkiss (you&#x2019;ll remember him), and his family.</p><p>You will also note that, in the highly unlikely event of Barbara, Esme and me dying simultaneously, as in a plane crash, you would become a beneficiary, along with the foundation mentioned in the will. I say highly unlikely because we always travel on different airplanes.</p><p>Next time we meet, I will explain why I have made the decisions I have regarding our estate. In the meantime, I ask you to follow my wishes as you understand them.</p><p>It is not inconceivable that, should I die anytime soon, my employers may express an interest in my affairs, and I authorize you to cooperate with them to the extent you deem advisable.</p><p>Finally, I have attached a joint financial statement, giving account numbers, phone numbers of brokers, etc., which you would find useful in the event of our deaths. I should explain that most of our combined assets come from Barbara, inherited from her father.</p><p>I thank you for your kind attention to this matter, and the next time I find myself in New York, I&#x2019;ll take you to dinner again&#x2014;it&#x2019;s been too long&#x2014;or, alternatively, perhaps you might find some time to spend with us in June in Islesboro. I built my own house there four years ago, and you&#x2019;ll find it more comfortable than the old family barn, now occupied by Caleb and his m�nage.</p><p>Warm regards,</p><p>Dick</p><p>Stone put the letter aside and read the will and the financial statement, then he called the group back into his office.</p><p>&#x201c;All right. I have Dick&#x2019;s permission to talk with you about the package. Let me summarize: It contains a letter to me, his and his wife&#x2019;s will and a financial statement.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What...&#x201d; Lance began.</p><p>Stone held up a hand. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all very simple,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If Dick dies first, Barbara gets everything; if she dies first, he gets everything; if they both die, their daughter, Esme, gets everything in trust. I am appointed their executor and their daughter&#x2019;s guardian and trustee.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What happens if they all die?&#x201d; Lance asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Apart from a few bequests to Barbara&#x2019;s relatives and to a family retainer, the bulk of the estate would go to the Samuel Bernard Foundation. I would inherit the use of the Islesboro house for the life of myself and my heirs, along with the proceeds of a trust, set up to pay the expenses of maintaining and running the house. If I don&#x2019;t want the place, it would be sold, and the proceeds would go to the same foundation. Dick has specifically excluded his brother and his brother&#x2019;s family as heirs, and if I sell the house, I am instructed to entail the deed in such a way that Caleb could never buy it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds like some hard feelings between the two of them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Given my experience of them in their youth, I&#x2019;m not surprised,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;I know Sam Bernard, of course, but what is the foundation?&#x201d; Samuel Bernard had been a law-school professor of Stone&#x2019;s and had remained a mentor who had historic connections to the CIA.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s set up to provide for the families of Agency officers killed or disabled in the line of duty,&#x201d; Lance said. &#x201c;How much did Dick leave the foundation?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A million dollars,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;in the event of his own death. As I said, in the event of the whole family dying simultaneously, most of the estate goes to the foundation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And how much is that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thirty million dollars, give or take. Dick&#x2019;s wife was a very wealthy woman.&#x201d;</p><p>Lance drew in a quick breath. &#x201c;That is astonishingly generous,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Lance,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;what reason do you have for thinking that Dick murdered his family and killed himself?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That is the opinion of the sheriff and the state police in Maine,&#x201d; Lance said. &#x201c;My superiors would like for you and me to determine if he&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you think Dick was mentally ill? You&#x2019;ve seen him more recently than I.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have no reason to think so, and certainly the contents of his letter to you and his will are lucid and make him seem sound of mind.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So the sheriff wants us to believe that a man who has spent his career handling intricate intelligence matters and who has just received the promotion of a lifetime is so nuts and despondent as to murder his family and commit suicide?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At this date, I suppose the sheriff&#x2019;s conclusions are preliminary and based only on the physical evidence.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And what is the physical evidence?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have no idea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then I guess we&#x2019;d better go to Maine,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p></p></p><h2>The Art of Passing the Buck, Vol I; Secrets of Wills and Trusts Revealed</h2><p>The Art of Passing the Buck offers a simple, comprehensive explanation of how Wills and Trusts work. It reveals wealth retention, management and empowerment techniques you can use to build a family dynasty. Inheritance may often degenerate into legal battles, and/or dark whisperings among relatives. Who was cared for or neglected comes to the fore when reading the Will or setting up the Trust. Sometimes, siblings battle among themselves over who gets what, while parents become distraught making the myriad decisions related to their own passing. We explain how there can be a smooth transition when both Grantors and Beneficiaries have vital information. A must read for both givers and receivers of wealth, this book also covers: the history of Trusts, Trust types, Trustees and the law, privacy, who should not have a Trust, parenting and perpetual wealth, and heirs: the favored and the flawed.

Public speaking, as Carnegie saw it, is a vital skill that can be attained through basic and repeated steps. His classic volume on the subject appeared in 1926 and was revised twice-in shortened versions-in 1956 and 1962. This 2006 revision-edited by a longtime consultant to Dale Carnegie &amp; Associates, Inc., and the editor in charge of updating <b>How to Win Friends and Influence People</b>-is the definitive one for our era. <br><br>While up-to-date in its language and points of reference, <b>Public Speaking for Success</b> preserves the <i>full range</i> of ideas and methods that appeared in the original: including Carnegie's complete speech and diction exercises, which follow each chapter, as the author originally designated them. This edition restores Carnegie's original appendix of the three complete self-help classics: <b>Acres of Diamonds</b> by Russell H. Conwell, <b>As a Man Thinketh</b> by James Allen, and <b>A Message to Garcia</b> by Elbert Hubbard. Carnegie included these essays in his original edition because, although they do not directly relate to public speaking, he felt they would be of great value to the readers. Here is the definitive update of the best-loved public-speaking book of all time.</p><p>Dale Carnegie (1888-1955) almost single-handedly created the self-help genre with his classic, <b>How to Win Friends and Influence People</b>.</p><h2>D-Day: The Battle for Normandy</h2><p><b>"Glorious, horrifying...&nbsp;<i>D-Day</i>&nbsp;is a vibrant work of history that honors the sacrifice of tens of thousands of men and women."&#x2014;<i>Time</i></b><br><br>Renowned historian Antony Beevor, author of <i>Stalingrad</i> and <i>The Battle of Arnhem</i>, and the man who "single-handedly transformed the reputation of military history" (<i>The Guardian</i>) presents the first major account in more than twenty years of the Normandy invasion and the liberation of Paris. This is the first book to describe not only the experiences of the American, British, Canadian, and German soldiers, but also the terrible suffering of the French caught up in the fighting. Beevor draws upon his research in more than thirty archives in six countries, going back to original accounts and interviews conducted by combat historians just after the action. <i>D-Day</i> is the consummate account of the invasion and the ferocious offensive that led to Paris's liberation.</p><p><b>Antony Beevor</b>&nbsp;is the bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>D-Day: The Battle for Normandy,</i>which received the Royal United Services&#x2019; Institute Westminster Medal<i>; The Battle for Spain</i>, which received the La Vanguardia Prize;&nbsp;<i>Paris After the Liberation 1944&#x2013;1949; Stalingrad</i>, winner of the Samuel Johnson Prize, the Wolfson Prize for History, and the Hawthornden Prize for Literature; and&nbsp;<i>The Fall of Berlin 1945</i>, which received the first Longman-History Today Trustees&#x2019; Award. He is the recipient of the 2014 Pritzker Military Museum &amp; Library Literature Award for Lifetime Achievement in Military Writing. Beevor lives in England.After briefly treating the buildup to D-Day, Beevor examines the invasion and subsequent liberation of Paris in a mix of sometimes-dry strategic overview and often-ghastly personal details. Simon Vance gives it all proper weight, without extravagance. He has a likable voice and pleasant English accent, which he varies, at times from one word to the next, to suit the large number of quotations. His American accent is good, and he even does Canadian. Other accents make one wonder about the convention of presenting foreign speech as accented English, but it works. It&#39;s easy to lose track in complex audio histories (especially military); Vance&#39;s clarity and excellent pacing help. A fascinating and well-read book.

In it, she summarizes her view of philosophy and deals with a broad spectrum of topics.<br><br></b> According to Ayn Rand, the choice we make is not whether to have a philosophy, but which one to have: rational, conscious, and therefore practical; or contradictory, unidentified, and ultimately lethal. <br><br>Written with all the clarity and eloquence that have placed Ayn Rand&#x2019;s Objectivist philosophy in the mainstream of American thought, these essays range over such basic issues as education, morality, censorship, and inflation to prove that philosophy is the fundamental force in all our lives.</p><p>Born February 2, 1905, <b>Ayn Rand</b> published her first novel, <i>We the Living</i>, in 1936. <i>Anthem</i> followed in 1938. It was with the publication of <i>The Fountainhead</i> (1943) and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> (1957) that she achieved her spectacular success. Rand&#x2019;s unique philosophy, Objectivism, has gained a worldwide audience. The fundamentals of her philosophy are put forth in three nonfiction books, <i>Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology</i>, <i>The Virtues of Selfishness</i>, and <i>Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal</i>. They are all available in Signet editions, as is the magnificent statement of her artistic credo, <i>The Romantic Manifesto</i>.''Ayn Rand's writings have altered and shaped the lives of millions.

He also likes little girls. And none more so than Lolita, who he&#39;ll do anything to possess. Is he in love or insane? A silver-tongued poet or a pervert? A tortured soul or a monster?! Or is he all of these?</p><p>Despite its lascivious reputation, the pleasures of <i>Lolita</i> are as much intellectual as erogenous. It is a love story with the power to raise both chuckles and eyebrows. Humbert Humbert is a European intellectual adrift in America, haunted by memories of a lost adolescent love. When he meets his ideal nymphet in the shape of 12-year-old Dolores Haze, he constructs an elaborate plot to seduce her, but first he must get rid of her mother. In spite of his diabolical wit, reality proves to be more slippery than Humbert's feverish fantasies, and Lolita refuses to conform to his image of the perfect lover.<p> Playfully perverse in form as well as content, riddled with puns and literary allusions, Nabokov's 1955 novel is a hymn to the Russian-born author's delight in his adopted language. Indeed, readers who want to probe all of its allusive nooks and crannies will need to consult the annotated edition. <i>Lolita</i> is undoubtedly, brazenly erotic, but the eroticism springs less from the "frail honey-hued shoulders ... the silky supple bare back" of little Lo than it does from the wantonly gorgeous prose that Humbert uses to recount his forbidden passion: </p><blockquote> She was musical and apple-sweet ... Lola the bobby-soxer, devouring her immemorial fruit, singing through its juice ... and every movement she made, every shuffle and ripple, helped me to conceal and to improve the secret system of tactile correspondence between beast and beauty--between my gagged, bursting beast and the beauty of her dimpled body in its innocent cotton frock. </blockquote> Much has been made of <i>Lolita</i> as metaphor, perhaps because the love affair at its heart is so troubling. Humbert represents the formal, educated Old World of Europe, while Lolita is America: ripening, beautiful, but not too bright and a little vulgar. Nabokov delights in exploring the intercourse between these cultures, and the passages where Humbert describes the suburbs and strip malls and motels of postwar America are filled with both attraction and repulsion, "those restaurants where the holy spirit of Huncan Dines had descended upon the cute paper napkins and cottage-cheese-crested salads." Yet however tempting the novel's symbolism may be, its chief delight--and power--lies in the character of Humbert Humbert. He, at least as he tells it, is no seedy skulker, no twisted destroyer of innocence. Instead, Nabokov's celebrated mouthpiece is erudite and witty, even at his most depraved. Humbert can't help it--linguistic <i>jouissance</i> is as important to him as the satisfaction of his arrested libido. <i>--Simon Leake</i>Critics are just beginning to hail Jeremy Irons' performance for Random House AudioBooks...<p><b>"a road trip to hell in a luxury sedan." </b><br>--Salon Magazine</p><p><b>"In his reading Irons recreates the clarity, precision, and lilt of every glorious sentence." </b><br>--The Washington Post</p><p><b>"Nabokov said Lolita was the record of his love affair with the English language; Irons makes it a menage a trois." </b><br>-- Vogue</p><p><b>"[Irons's] efforts have placed this superb audio on my life list, to be saved for repeated listening."</b><br>--Boston Globe</p><p>" . . . most praiseworthy of all the audio efforts I've heard . . ."<br>-- Men's Journal</p><p><b>"Irons' inspired reading is not to be missed."</b><br> -- Chicago Tribune</p><p><b>"...a beautifully produced recording that pushes the boundaries of the audio medium.<br> . . . hands down the best audio production of the year." </b><br>-- Library Journal</p><p><b>"Irons reads with wickedly understated malevolence, preserving Humbert's foolish patrician airs.

A no-holds-barred assault on popular superstitions and prejudices, with more than 80,000 copies in print, <i>Why People Believe Weird Things</i> debunks these nonsensical claims and explores the very human reasons people find otherworldly phenomena, conspiracy theories, and cults so appealing. In an entirely new chapter, "Why <i>Smart</i> People Believe in Weird Things," Michael Shermer takes on science luminaries like physicist Frank Tippler and others, who hide their spiritual beliefs behind the trappings of science.</p><p>Shermer, science historian and true crusader, also reveals the more dangerous side of such illogical thinking, including Holocaust denial, the recovered-memory movement, the satanic ritual abuse scare, and other modern crazes. <i>Why People Believe Strange Things</i> is an eye-opening resource for the most gullible among us and those who want to protect them.</p></p><p>Few can talk with more personal authority about the range of human beliefs than Michael Shermer. At various times in the past, Shermer has believed in fundamentalist Christianity, alien abductions, Ayn Rand, megavitamin therapy, and deep-tissue massage. Now he believes in skepticism, and his motto is "<i>Cognite tute</i>--think for yourself." This updated edition of <i>Why People Believe Weird Things</i> covers Holocaust denial and creationism in considerable detail, and has chapters on abductions, Satanism, Afrocentrism, near-death experiences, Randian positivism, and psychics. Shermer has five basic answers to the implied question in his title: for consolation, for immediate gratification, for simplicity, for moral meaning, and because hope springs eternal. He shows the kinds of errors in thinking that lead people to believe weird (that is, unsubstantiated) things, especially the built-in human need to see patterns, even where there is no pattern to be seen. Throughout, Shermer emphasizes that skepticism (in his sense) does not need to be cynicism: "Rationality tied to moral decency is the most powerful joint instrument for good that our planet has ever known." <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i><p><b>Michael Shermer</b> is the author of <i>The Believing Brain</i>, <i>Why People Believe Weird Things</i>, <i>The Science of Good and Evil</i>, <i>The Mind Of The Market</i>, <i>Why Darwin Matters</i>, <i>Science Friction</i>, <i>How We Believe</i> and other books on the evolution of human beliefs and behavior.

Identifying the woman is just the first step in what proves to be an emotionally charged investigation. Florence Horvath was an attractive, recently divorced heiress from Florida; she also had a penchant for steamy sex and was an enthusiastic participant in a video depicting the same. Somehow the combination of her past and present got her killed, but no one is talking&#x2014;not the crew of the Lady Jane, the Fort Lauderdale yacht moored in Paradise Harbor; not her very blond, very tan twin sisters, Corliss and Claudia; and not her curiously affectless parents, living out a sterile retirement in a Miami high rise. But someone&#x2014;Jesse&#x2014;has to speak for the dead, even if it puts him in harm's way.</p><p><b>Robert B. Parker</b> was the author of seventy books, including the legendary Spenser detective series, the novels featuring Police Chief Jesse Stone, and the acclaimed Virgil Cole&#x2013;Everett Hitch westerns, as well as the Sunny Randall novels. Winner of the Mystery Writers of America Grand Master Award and long considered the undisputed dean of American crime fiction, he died in January 2010.Race Week in Paradise, Massachusetts, brings Police Chief Jesse Stone more than the usual problems of bar fights and rowdy revelers when the body of a young woman washes ashore. Scott Sowers clips the flat Boston accents to portray the deputies and townsfolk--not overdone, but spot-on when he uses them. Sowers nicely captures the no-nonsense Stone-- former LA detective, now small-town sheriff. The smart dialogue is delivered in an almost syncopated style, making the best of Parker's "he said/ she said" conventions. Stone's perseverance in tracking a ring of sex peddlers and predators keeps the story intriguing, and his conquest of some personal demons bodes well for future entries in the series.

Once a scandalously inventive puppeteer, Sabbath at sixty-four is still defiantly antagonistic and exceedingly libidinous. But after the death of his long-time mistress&#x2014;an erotic free spirit whose adulterous daring surpassed even his own&#x2014;Sabbath embarks on a turbulent journey into his past. Bereft and grieving, besieged by the ghosts of those who loved and hated him most, he contrives a succession of farcical disasters that take him to the brink of madness and extinction.</p><p>Mickey Sabbath, the hero in <i>Sabbath's Theater</i>, the winner of the 1995 National Book Award, makes a concerted effort to be bad. Like Alexander Portnoy, the famously self-abusing character in Roth's 1969 novel Portnoy's Complaint, Sabbath has an appetite for "acts of exhibitionism, voyeurism, fetishism, auto-eroticism and oral coitus." But while Portnoy's antics were usually comical and liberating, Sabbath often feels imprisoned by his own acts of self-indulgence. Though his frantic pursuit of sex is a desperate attempt to abate his anxieties about death, it only serves to obliterate any semblance of real life he could have had."A great work . . . Roth's richest, most rewarding novel . . . funny and profound . . . as powerful as writing can be." &#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"This splendidly wicked book . . . is among the most remarkable novels in recent years. . . .

Known for unveiling unseen worlds, scientific breakthroughs, and historical secrets, Rollins' knack for breakneck pacing and stunning originality has been hailed by critics and embraced by scores of millions of readers around the world.<br><br><b>The Critics Rave</b><br><br>The New York Times says that his "roguish charm comes from his efforts to persuade readers the story is credible [through] real-life sources for his novel's science, history and geography." Rollins' rare blend of action, suspense, and knowledge was also mentioned by the Huffington Post, which stated that "After Crichton passed away in 2008 he clearly passed the baton to James Rollins, who like Crichton, is a renaissance man."<br><br>NPR calls his work "adventurous and enormously engrossing..." and the New York Journal of Books had this to say: "If you're a fan of smart, entertaining adventure fiction, this is your summer beach read writ large....All the science, all the history, and all the locations are masterfully intertwined. The characters are multi-dimensional. And the story is, well, a corker."<br><br><b>The Story Teller's Story</b><br><br>As a boy immersed in the scientific adventures of Doc Savage, the wonders of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and pulps such as The Shadow, The Spider, and The Avenger, James Rollins decided he wanted to be a writer. He honed his storytelling skills early, spinning elaborate tales that were often at the heart of pranks played on his brothers and sisters.<br><br>Before he would set heroes and villains on harrowing adventures, Rollins embarked on a career in veterinary medicine, graduating from the University of Missouri and establishing a successful veterinary practice. This hands-on knowledge of medicine and science helps shape the research and scientific speculation that set James Rollins books apart.<br><br><b>Explosive Page-Turning Adventures</b><br><br>The exotic locales of James Rollins novels have emerged as a hybrid between imagination, research, and his extensive travels throughout the United States and Europe, as well as New Zealand, the South Pacific, China, Southeast Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America. Recent jaunts include book tours and stops across the country and several European nations to give talks, seminars, and media interviews.In recent years, much of James' travel has involved meeting readers in small and large groups, at writing and fan conferences, and even aboard seagoing "seminars." James' mentoring and coaching skills have made him a sought after writing instructor and guest speaker for workshops, symposia, conventions, and other forums throughout the country.<br><br>James Rollins is the author of nine thrillers in the bestselling Sigma Force series (Sandstorm, Map of Bones, Black Order, The Judas Strain, The Last Oracle, The Doomsday Key, The Devil Colony, Bloodline, and The Eye of God); six individual adventure thrillers; and the Jake Ransom middle grade series (Jake Ransom and the Skull King's Shadow, Jake Ransom and the Howling Sphinx.)In a masterwork of historical mystery and scientific exploration, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author James Rollins reveals an apocalyptic vision of the day after tomorrow, of a future predicted by the distant past, of a world doomed to burn under <i>The Eye of God</i><br><br>The crash of a U.S. military research satellite in the remote wilds of Mongolia triggers an explosive search for the valuable cargo it holds: a code-black physics project connected to the study of dark energy, the energy associated with the birth of our universe.

All were affected by the same global climatic factors that caused massive crop failures, and all experienced brutal famines that decimated local populations. But the effects of drought were magnified in each case because of singularly destructive policies promulgated by different ruling elites. <br><br> Davis argues that the seeds of underdevelopment in what later became known as the Third World were sown in this era of High Imperialism, as the price for capitalist modernization was paid in the currency of millions of peasants&#x2019; lives.</p><p><b>Mike Davis</b> is the author of several books including <i>City of Quartz</i>, <i>The Monster at Our Door</i>, <i>Buda&#x2019;s Wagon</i>, and <i>Planet of Slums</i>.

She lives in a suburb of St. Louis with her family.<p></p><p>1</p><p>JASON SCHUYLER, ONE of my best friends and favorite werewolves, stood in the morning sunlight of the kitchen. His yellow hair gleamed in the light, so that his boyishly handsome face was haloed with sunshine, but as I looked into the pure, soft blue of his eyes I knew that devil&#x2019;s horns were more his style than halos, and pure was only a way to describe his eyes, not him. He&#x2019;d been a precocious teenager and his day job was still assistant manager and exotic dancer at Guilty Pleasures. The body that showed around his tank top and jogging shorts proved that he stayed in shape for his job, but none of that was what made halos seem wrong for him. He had a streak of mischief in him so strong that he couldn&#x2019;t quite resist pushing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. everything. If the situation was tense he had to resist not making a wisecrack at the wrong moment; since I had the same urge, it was one of our bonding moments. He and I both tended to poke the proverbial badger with a stick until it rushed out of the hole and tried to eat us. We&#x2019;d both learned over the years to curb this urge, and were much happier for controlling that part of us, but Jason still had that edge of deviltry to the smile on his face, and the shine in those spring-sky eyes.</p><p>I pushed my own thick black curls away from my face; they fell right back against my cheek, but sometimes it&#x2019;s the effort that counts. I sat at the kitchen table in my long silk robe, sipping coffee and watching that smile on his face. Either he was enjoying the hell out of getting us all out of bed at this outrageously early hour, or he was hiding behind the smile. Most of us have our blank face, a version of the cop face, and Jason hid behind a grin usually, but since he also spent a lot of time actually smiling, laughing, or grinning, it was great camouflage for whatever else he was thinking.</p><p>I tucked my robe a little closer across my chest, not because Jason hadn&#x2019;t seen me nude in the past, but because he&#x2019;d asked for a conversation as his friend, not a friends-with-benefits booty call, so flashing breasts seemed inappropriate. It was tricky sleeping with someone who was actually your friend but never quite your boyfriend, a thin line to walk between true friendship and <i>hey, baby</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;We all work nights, Jason; what was so important that you got us up this early?&#x201d;</p><p>His grin widened, and he stepped forward enough that I could see his straight blond hair without the sunshine special effects. He&#x2019;d cut his hair again, almost businessman short. He was one of the few men I knew who really did look better in shorter hair; it seemed to open up his face and make you see that he was handsome in his own right, when he wasn&#x2019;t clowning around or being irritating, though honestly that last part had almost gone away. I&#x2019;d met Jason when he was nineteen; now at twenty-five he had grown up. I was only five or six years older than he was&#x2014;depending on the time of year, our birthdays made us seem to gain or lose a year on each other. At twenty-five and thirty it wasn&#x2019;t a big age difference; at nineteen and twenty-five it had seemed like more.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s wait for everyone else,&#x201d; he said, and sipped his own coffee. He didn&#x2019;t really drink a lot of coffee; he sipped at it, and would eventually put it down about half drunk and cold. Since we ground our own beans and used a French press to make the coffee, it was a waste of good, hot caffeine.</p><p>I huddled around my third cup of it, determined to make up for Jason&#x2019;s lack of enthusiasm.</p><p>Envy walked into the kitchen. She was five-eleven, so she towered over Jason and me. I was five-three and he was five-four. She&#x2019;d combed her thick, almost shoulder-length blond hair, but hadn&#x2019;t bothered with makeup any more than I had. The strong cheekbones of her face seemed unfinished without the makeup, so that you got a glimpse of what she might have looked like at fifteen instead of the very grown-up early twenty-something. She&#x2019;d thrown an oversized man&#x2019;s T-shirt over her, and on me it would have hung to midthigh, or even my knees; on her it barely covered her ass, so that she was all long golden legs as she padded barefoot into the room.</p><p>She was everything I&#x2019;d wanted to be when I was a little girl: tall, blond, and Nordic-looking like my father and stepmother, and stepsister, and half brother, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I&#x2019;d made peace with my mother&#x2019;s Mexican heritage that had given me black curls and dark brown eyes, and could even acknowledge that my skin was paler than Envy&#x2019;s and she tanned better than I did, which just seemed wrong. She blinked pale blue tiger eyes into the sunlight as if she were startled. None of us were morning people. The tiger eyes were literal; she was part of the golden tiger clan, which was one of the few inherited types of lycanthropy, and one of the ways they proved their pure bloodlines was that they were born with permanent tiger eyes in their human faces. Most of the other wereanimals I&#x2019;d seen with animal eyes in human form had them because they&#x2019;d spent too much time in their beast form. You could get stuck, and usually the eyes were the first thing to stick.</p><p>&#x201c;Coffee&#x2019;s hot,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Tea,&#x201d; she muttered.</p><p>I started to tell her to help herself, and then realized she didn&#x2019;t know where the tea was, or anything. It was the first time Envy had stayed overnight at the house in Jefferson County. She lived at the Circus of the Damned with the bulk of our people, but she&#x2019;d been dropped off here after her date with Richard Zeeman, wolf king, Ulfric of the local werewolves, and college biology professor. He had a house out here in Jefferson County, too, so it had made more sense for him to drop her here than driving her all the way back into the city to the Circus, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure I wanted them to make a habit out of it. Richard was sort of my ex; we&#x2019;d even been briefly engaged. We still had sex occasionally, so having his current lover dropped at my house for a sleepover was a little weird. He&#x2019;d offered to sleep over with Envy here, but I, and she, had vetoed it. We were all polyamorous, which means to love more, so everyone knew what and who everyone else was doing, but that didn&#x2019;t mean there weren&#x2019;t moments when too much sharing was, well, too much. Richard&#x2019;s work schedule was almost the opposite of mine, which meant that though we were lovers, it wasn&#x2019;t that frequent. Sex with him was great, but we&#x2019;d both done a lot of emotional damage to each other over the years, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the needs he&#x2019;d met in my life were now met by other people, who liked, or loved, each other and got along a hell of a lot better with the other men. Richard was trying, but in some ways he&#x2019;d worked out his shit too late to truly be a part of our happy little poly group. He sort of floated on the edges of my life, and I on his.</p><p>Envy had slept in one of the guest rooms, but still it was the first time she&#x2019;d curled those long legs underneath my kitchen table.</p><p>Was I supposed to wait on her? Fetch her tea? I felt the first bubbling of anger, which was still one of my best things, when I didn&#x2019;t know what else to do.</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of tea do you want?&#x201d; Jason asked. He put his coffee down and went to the cabinets. He&#x2019;d stayed over enough to make tea without having to ask directions.</p><p>&#x201c;Mint,&#x201d; she said, and laid her head on her arms so that she looked like she was going to take a nap on the table.</p><p>&#x201c;Peppermint, spearmint, or a medley?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;You pick,&#x201d; she muttered, not raising her head.</p><p>&#x201c;Rough night?&#x201d; I asked, sipping more of the strong black coffee.</p><p>She moved her head enough to roll an eye at me through the fall of yellow hair. It reminded me disturbingly of Dev, her cousin, who was also a weretiger of the gold clan, and one of my lovers. Dev was short for Devil, which was a nickname for Mephistopheles. Envy had gotten one of the better family names.</p><p>&#x201c;You really need to have sex with him more often.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean Richard?&#x201d; I asked, because she was also sleeping with Jean-Claude, head vampire of the United States and my fianc�. I did mention that we were polyamorous, right? It wasn&#x2019;t cheating, because everyone got everyone else&#x2019;s permission, but it was complicated, sometimes very complicated.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said, still just looking at me with that one inhuman eye.</p><p>&#x201c;Did Richard ask you to talk to me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said, and just looked at me as if waiting for me to say something. Was I supposed to pry information out of her?</p><p>&#x201c;What made it a rough night?&#x201d; Jason asked. He&#x2019;d filled the rapid-heat electric kettle, and it was starting to warm up. He had a mug, and a tea bag was trailing out of it, waiting. There was actually loose-leaf tea in there somewhere, but no mint outside bags.</p><p>Envy turned her head enough to look at him, so that all I could see was the thick hair. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;ll understand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Try me, I&#x2019;m very sympathetic.&#x201d; He grinned when he said it, which left a debate on whether he was really sympathetic or just kidding.</p><p>&#x201c;He really is a good listener,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>She rolled her head back to look at me, and I realized that her hiding her face in her hair might be a stress reaction. What the heck had happened last night?</p><p>&#x201c;He says you and he just can&#x2019;t get your schedules to match up for sex lately, is that true?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said, and drank more coffee; maybe if I just drank enough of it, I could do this conversation without losing my temper.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you enjoy the sex?&#x201d;</p><p>I drank more coffee. Maybe if I drowned myself in it? &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When he&#x2019;s really rough in bed, how do you get him to stop?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You get him to stop by saying &#x2018;No, stop,&#x2019;&#x201d; I said.</p><p>She rose up enough to shake her head. &#x201c;No? I can say no and he&#x2019;ll respect that? I mean, how do you tell him it&#x2019;s too rough?&#x201d;</p><p>I fought not to frown at her. &#x201c;I say, &#x2018;Ow, that hurt, stop it.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>Jason piped up, &#x201c;Or my favorite, &#x2018;Do that again and I&#x2019;ll kill you.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not saying it right, Jason; it&#x2019;s &#x2018;Do that again and I will fucking kill you.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>He laughed. &#x201c;Oh, yeah, I forgot that part.&#x201d; He leaned against the cabinets, grinning at both of us. I didn&#x2019;t feel like smiling, so I glared at him. His grin widened, eyes sparkling with it.</p><p>I shook my head and went back to huddling over my coffee. Jason was incorrigible; trying to corrige him just irritated me and amused the hell out of him.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Ow</i> really is a safeword for me,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Richard says you like rough sex&#x2014;was he lying?&#x201d;</p><p>I stared into my coffee, debating on whether to get up and add to the cup, or if I had the courage to look her in the face while we had this conversation. Fuck, courage it was.</p><p>I turned to look into those beautiful otherworldly eyes and said, &#x201c;I like rough sex. I like sex with Richard. Now, what&#x2019;s up? What do you want to know, or say?&#x201d;</p><p>She sat up straighter, squaring her shoulders. &#x201c;Well, that is direct.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure I&#x2019;ve had this conversation with other girlfriends of his over the years, so just say it, Envy. Did the sex get too rough last night?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And what do you want me to do about it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you really like sex as rough as he does?&#x201d;</p><p>I shrugged. &#x201c;Yes, sometimes, not every night, but yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>She shivered. &#x201c;Fine, Anita, you want to be direct, I can be direct. I had to tell him to stop, or ease up, constantly last night. He&#x2019;d been great, the sex would be wonderful, he&#x2019;d bring me to orgasm and then he&#x2019;d start being too rough again, as if once he made me come he thought it earned him the right to be too rough and hurt me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Most women can take rougher intercourse after enough foreplay,&#x201d; Jason said. &#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t trying to be mean, just thought he&#x2019;d done enough prep work to have sex the way he wanted to have it, and you&#x2019;d enjoy it, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I didn&#x2019;t, and I had to keep telling him to stop. I finally told him to get off me, that was it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you mean for last night, or do you mean done as in done forever?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>She looked at me, and her eyes darkened the way that human eyes do when they start to get angry. &#x201c;Forever. The sex is amazing if he can control himself, but he&#x2019;s so big that if he just starts pounding it hurts, and it drowns out all the orgasms, or even stops me from orgasming, because it hurts too much.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry he hurt you,&#x201d; I said. What else could I say?</p><p>&#x201c;How long has it been since you&#x2019;ve slept with him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A while,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t remember?&#x201d;</p><p>I shrugged again. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not one of my main sweeties. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Maybe six weeks? He&#x2019;s trying to date some human woman, and it takes time to really date someone. Our booty calls had to take a backseat to him date-dating someone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As opposed to just fucking them,&#x201d; she said, and she sounded angry again.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, dating takes more time than just fucking,&#x201d; I said. I fought not to get angry, or be offended, not to add any more emotion to what promised to be an emotional minefield.</p><p>&#x201c;I enjoy sleeping with Jean-Claude, he&#x2019;s wonderful, but Richard is a brute in bed.&#x201d;</p><p>I so wanted out of this conversation, but it was like a train wreck&#x2014;you knew it was coming, but sometimes you&#x2019;re still along for the ride.</p><p>&#x201c;He can be, I guess.&#x201d;</p><p>Jason came to stand beside me, touched my shoulder. &#x201c;Say the rest, Anita.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked up at him. &#x201c;What rest?&#x201d;</p><p>He looked at me, and it was that <i>you know</i> look. There weren&#x2019;t many people I&#x2019;d take that look from, but Jason was on that short list.</p><p>&#x201c;I like that he&#x2019;s rough. Sometimes a brute in bed is exactly what I want,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>She shuddered. &#x201c;You can have him, I&#x2019;m done.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want him as a boyfriend either, but the occasional sex is great, that was always fabulous between us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You look delicate, like he&#x2019;d break you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Looks can be deceiving,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Jason squeezed my shoulder. &#x201c;The fact that Anita likes rough sex is one of the reasons I wanted everyone to meet this morning.&#x201d;</p><p>The comment made me look up at him. &#x201c;What does that mean?&#x201d;</p><p>The tea timer went off and he went to rescue it, and also neatly avoided answering my question.</p><p>I called after him. &#x201c;What do my sexual preferences have to do with anything?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting the tea,&#x201d; he said with his back to us as he fished the bag out of the mug.</p><p>&#x201c;What is this little meeting about this morning?&#x201d; I asked, suspicious now.</p><p>Nathaniel spoke as he came into the kitchen. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about helping everybody in our poly group feel better.&#x201d;</p><p>He&#x2019;d pulled on a pair of his favorite jeans, the ones that were nearly white with washing and had begun to thread out across the thighs. His knees peeked out of actual holes as he padded barefoot toward me. His ankle-length hair was in its usual braid so that it was mostly hidden behind him with only glimpses of the thick auburn rope peeking from behind him as he moved.</p><p>My smile of greeting changed to something less happy. &#x201c;What does that mean, and why do I feel like you and Jason have been plotting behind my back about something?&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled, and it was the real deal, not the one that he flashed at Guilty Pleasures to get customers to shove hundred-dollar bills down his pants. If they could have seen this smile full of love and lust and just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Nathaniel, they&#x2019;d have found thousand-dolla...</p></p><h2>Russian Stories: A Dual-Language Book (English and Russian Edition)</h2><p><p>The story, or novella, as a literary genre has a much shorter history in Russia than in some Western countries, but it has nevertheless produced important works by some of the greatest names in Russian literature. This dual-language volume contains 12 such stories &#x2014; memorable tales by Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Pushkin, Chekhov, Gogol, Turgenev, Bunin, and other masters. Each selection is presented here in the original Russian with an excellent literal English translation on the facing pages.<br>Also included are linguistic and cultural notes, a Russian-English vocabulary, study questions and more. In addition, Professor Struve has supplied an enlightening introduction to the Russian short story, as well as concise biographical/critical introductions to each selection. An especially helpful feature for students of Russian is the presence of stress accents in the Russian text, a feature usually found only in primers.</p><p></p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Federal Husband</h2><p>Federal thinking is foreign to the modern mind. Federal has come to mean nothing more than centralized or big. Because our federal government has become so uncovenantal, it is not surprising that the original meaning of the word is lost. But federal thinking is the backbone of historic Protestant theology, and the Church needs to recover the covenantal understanding of federal headship. Husbands are to lead their families, taking responsibility for them as covenant heads--as federal husbands. <p></p><p>This book is a part of Douglas Wilson's series of books on the family, which has helped many people trying to deal with the on the ground messes that come with sinners trying to live under the same roof. This book on covenantal headship contains much practical and biblical wisdom that is never more timely than now, but which we will always need to be reminded of again and again.</p></p><p><b>Douglas Wilson</b> is a Senior Fellow of theology at New Saint Andrews College.

They felt trapped too. &#x2018;Like the maze at Hampton Court,&#x2019; their mother said. &#x2018;Remember?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; Jessica said. <br><br>&#x2018;No,&#x2019; Joanna said. <br><br>&#x2018;You were just a baby,&#x2019; their mother said to Joanna. &#x2018;Like Joseph is now.&#x2019; Jessica was eight, Joanna was six. <br><br>The little road (they always called it &#x2018;the lane&#x2019;) snaked one way and then another, so that you couldn&#x2019;t see anything ahead of you. They had to keep the dog on the lead and stay close to the hedges in case a car &#x2018;came out of nowhere&#x2019;. Jessica was the eldest so she was the one who always got to hold the dog&#x2019;s lead. She spent a lot of her time training the dog, &#x2018;Heel!&#x2019; and &#x2018;Sit!&#x2019; and &#x2018;Come!&#x2019; Their mother said she wished Jessica was as obedient as the dog. Jessica was always the one who was in charge. Their mother said to Joanna, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s all right to have a mind of your own, you know. You should stick up for yourself, think for yourself,&#x2019; but Joanna didn&#x2019;t want to think for herself. <br><br>The bus dropped them on the big road and then carried on to somewhere else. It was &#x2018;a palaver&#x2019; getting them all off the bus. Their mother held Joseph under one arm like a parcel and with her other hand she struggled to open out his newfangled buggy. Jessica and Joanna shared the job of lifting the shopping off the bus. The dog saw to himself. &#x2018;No one ever helps,&#x2019; their mother said. &#x2018;Have you noticed that?&#x2019; They had. <br><br>&#x2018;Your father&#x2019;s country fucking idyll,&#x2019; their mother said as the bus drove away in a blue haze of fumes and heat. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t you swear,&#x2019; she added automatically, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m the only person allowed to swear.&#x2019; <br><br>They didn&#x2019;t have a car any more. Their father (&#x2018;the bastard&#x2019;) had driven away in it. Their father wrote books, &#x2018;novels&#x2019;. He had taken one down from a shelf and shown it to Joanna, pointed out his photo�graph on the back cover and said, &#x2018;That&#x2019;s me,&#x2019; but she wasn&#x2019;t allowed to read it, even though she was already a good reader. (&#x2018;Not yet, one day. I write for grown-ups, I&#x2019;m afraid,&#x2019; he laughed. &#x2018;There&#x2019;s stuff in there, well . . .&#x2019;) <br><br>Their father was called Howard Mason and their mother&#x2019;s name was Gabrielle. Sometimes people got excited and smiled at their father and said, &#x2018;Are you <i>the</i> Howard Mason?&#x2019; (Or sometimes, not smiling, &#x2018;<i>that</i> Howard Mason&#x2019; which was different although Joanna wasn&#x2019;t sure how.) <br><br>Their mother said that their father had uprooted them and planted them &#x2018;in the middle of nowhere&#x2019;. &#x2018;Or Devon, as it&#x2019;s commonly known,&#x2019; their father said. He said he needed &#x2018;space to write&#x2019; and it would be good for all of them to be &#x2018;in touch with nature&#x2019;. &#x2018;No �television!&#x2019; he said as if that was something they would enjoy. <br><br>Joanna still missed her school and her friends and <i>Wonder Woman</i> and a house on a street that you could walk along to a shop where you could buy the <i>Beano</i> and a liquorice stick and choose from three different kinds of apples instead of having to walk along a lane and a road and take two buses and then do the same thing all over again in reverse. <br><br>The first thing their father did when they moved to Devon was to buy six red hens and a hive full of bees. He spent all autumn digging over the garden at the front of the house so it would be &#x2018;ready for spring&#x2019;. When it rained the garden turned to mud and the mud was trailed everywhere in the house, they even found it on their bed sheets. When winter came a fox ate the hens without them ever �having laid an egg and the bees all froze to death which was unheard of, according to their father, who said he was going to put all those things in the book (&#x2018;the novel&#x2019;) he was writing. &#x2018;So that&#x2019;s all right then,&#x2019; their mother said. <br><br>Their father wrote at the kitchen table because it was the only room in the house that was even the slightest bit warm, thanks to the huge temperamental Aga that their mother said was &#x2018;going to be <br>the death of her&#x2019;. &#x2018;I should be so lucky,&#x2019; their father muttered. (His book wasn&#x2019;t going well.) They were all under his feet, even their mother. <br><br>&#x2018;You smell of soot,&#x2019; their father said to their mother. &#x2018;And cabbage and milk.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;And you smell of failure,&#x2019; their mother said. <br><br>Their mother used to smell of all kinds of interesting things, paint and turpentine and tobacco and the Je Reviens perfume that their father had been buying for her since she was seventeen years old and &#x2018;a Catholic schoolgirl&#x2019;, and which meant &#x2018;I will return&#x2019; and was a message to her. Their mother was &#x2018;a beauty&#x2019; according to their father but their mother said she was &#x2018;a painter&#x2019;, although she hadn&#x2019;t painted anything since they moved to Devon. &#x2018;No room for two creative �talents in a marriage,&#x2019; she said in that way she had, raising her eyebrows while inhaling smoke from the little brown cigarillos she smoked. She pronounced it <i>thigariyo</i> like a foreigner. When she was a child she had lived in faraway places that she would take them to one day. She was warm-blooded, she said, not like their father who was a reptile. Their mother was clever and funny and surprising and �nothing like their friends&#x2019; mothers. &#x2018;Exotic&#x2019;, their father said. <br><br>The argument about who smelled of what wasn&#x2019;t over apparently because their mother picked up a blue-and-white-striped jug from the dresser and threw it at their father, who was sitting at the table staring at his typewriter as if the words would write themselves if he was patient enough. The jug hit him on the side of the head and he roared with shock and pain. With a speed that Joanna could only admire, Jessica plucked Joseph out of his high-chair and said, &#x2018;Come on,&#x2019; to Joanna and they went upstairs where they tickled Joseph on the double bed that Joanna and Jessica shared. There was no heating in the bedroom and the bed was piled high with eiderdowns and old coats that belonged to their mother. Eventually all three of them fell asleep, nestled in the mingled scents of damp and mothballs and Je Reviens. <br><br>When Joanna woke up she found Jessica propped up on pillows, wearing gloves and a pair of earmuffs and one of the coats from the bed, drowning her like a tent. She was reading a book by torchlight. <br><br>&#x2018;Electricity&#x2019;s off,&#x2019; she said, without taking her eyes off the book. On the other side of the wall they could hear the horrible animal noises that meant their parents were friends again. Jessica silently offered Joanna the earmuffs so that she didn&#x2019;t have to listen. <br><br>When the spring finally came, instead of planting a vegetable �garden, their father went back to London and lived with &#x2018;his other woman&#x2019; &#x2014; which was a big surprise to Joanna and Jessica, although not apparently to their mother. Their father&#x2019;s other woman was called Martina &#x2014; <i>the poet</i> &#x2014; their mother spat out the word as if it was a curse. Their mother called the other woman (<i>the poet</i>) names that were so bad that when they dared to whisper them (<i>bitch-cunt-whore-poet</i>) to each other beneath the bedclothes they were like poison in the air. <br><br>Although now there was only one person in the marriage, their mother still didn&#x2019;t paint.<br>They made their way along the lane in single file, &#x2018;Indian file&#x2019;, their mother said. The plastic shopping bags hung from the handles of the buggy and if their mother let go it tipped backwards on to the ground. <br><br>&#x2018;We must look like refugees,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Yet we are not downhearted,&#x2019; she added cheerfully. They were going to move back into town at the end of the summer, &#x2018;in time for school&#x2019;.<br><br>&#x2018;Thank God,&#x2019; Jessica said, in just the same way their mother said it. <br><br>Joseph was asleep in the buggy, his mouth open, a faint rattle from his chest because he couldn&#x2019;t shake off a summer cold. He was so hot that their mother stripped him to his nappy and Jessica blew on the thin ribs of his little body to cool him down until their mother said, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t wake him.&#x2019; <br><br>There was the tang of manure in the air and the smell of the musty grass and the cow parsley got inside Joanna&#x2019;s nose and made her sneeze. <br><br>&#x2018;Bad luck,&#x2019; her mother said, &#x2018;you&#x2019;re the one that got my allergies.&#x2019; Their mother&#x2019;s dark hair and pale skin went to her &#x2018;beautiful boy&#x2019; Joseph, her green eyes and her &#x2018;painter&#x2019;s hands&#x2019; went to Jessica. Joanna got the allergies. Bad luck. Joseph and their mother shared a birthday too although Joseph hadn&#x2019;t had any birthdays yet. In another week it would be his first. &#x2018;That&#x2019;s a special birthday,&#x2019; their mother said. Joanna thought all birthdays were special. <br><br>Their mother was wearing Joanna&#x2019;s favourite dress, blue with a pattern of red strawberries. Their mother said it was old and next summer she would cut it up and make something for Joanna out of it if she liked. Joanna could see the muscles on her mother&#x2019;s tanned legs moving as she pushed the buggy up the hill. She was strong. Their father said she was &#x2018;fierce&#x2019;. Joanna liked that word. Jessica was fierce too. Joseph was nothing yet. He was just a baby, fat and happy. He liked oatmeal and mashed banana, and the mobile of little paper birds their mother had made for him that hung above his cot. He liked being tickled by his sisters. He liked his sisters. <br><br>Joanna could feel sweat running down her back. Her worn cotton dress was sticking to her skin. The dress was a hand-me-down from Jessica. &#x2018;Poor but honest,&#x2019; their mother laughed. Her big mouth turned down when she laughed so that she never seemed happy even when she was. Everything Joanna had was handed down from Jessica. It was as if without Jessica there would be no Joanna. Joanna filled the spaces Jessica left behind as she moved on. <br><br>Invisible on the other side of the hedge, a cow made a bellowing noise that made her jump. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s just a cow,&#x2019; her mother said. <br><br>&#x2018;Red Devons,&#x2019; Jessica said, even though she couldn&#x2019;t see them. How did she know? She knew the names of everything, seen and unseen. Joanna wondered if she would ever know all the things that Jessica knew. <br><br>After you had walked along the lane for a while you came to a wooden gate with a stile. They couldn&#x2019;t get the buggy through the stile so they had to open the gate. Jessica let the dog off the lead and he scrambled up and over the gate in the way that Jessica had taught him. The sign on the gate said &#x2018;Please Close The Gate Behind You&#x2019;. Jessica always ran ahead and undid the clasp and then they both pushed at the gate and swung on it as it opened. Their mother had to heave and shove at the buggy because all the winter mud had dried into deep awkward ruts that the wheels got stuck in. They swung on the gate to close it as well. Jessica checked the clasp. Sometimes they hung upside down on the gate and their hair reached the ground like brooms sweeping the dust and their mother said, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t do that.&#x2019; <br><br>The track bordered a field. &#x2018;Wheat,&#x2019; Jessica said. The wheat was very high although not as high as the hedges in the lane. &#x2018;They&#x2019;ll be harvesting soon,&#x2019; their mother said. &#x2018;Cutting it down,&#x2019; she added, for Joanna&#x2019;s benefit. &#x2018;Then we&#x2019;ll sneeze and wheeze, the pair of <br>us.&#x2019; Joanna was already wheezing, she could hear the breath whistling in her chest. <br><br>The dog ran into the field and disappeared. A moment later he sprang out of the wheat again. Last week Joanna had followed the dog into the field and got lost and no one could find her for a long time. She could hear them calling her, moving further and further away. Nobody heard her when she called back. The dog found her. <br><br>They stopped halfway along and sat down on the grass at the side of the track, under the shady trees. Their mother took the plastic �carrier bags off the buggy handles and from one of the bags brought out some little cartons of orange juice and a box of chocolate finger biscuits. The orange juice was warm and the chocolate biscuits had melted together. They gave some of the biscuits to the dog. Their mother laughed with her down-turned mouth and said, &#x2018;God, what a mess,&#x2019; and looked in the baby-bag and found wipes for their �chocolate-covered hands and mouths. When they lived in London they used to have proper picnics, loading up the boot of the car with a big wicker basket that had belonged to their mother&#x2019;s mother who was rich but dead (which was just as well apparently because it meant she didn&#x2019;t have to see her only daughter married to a selfish, �fornicating waster). If their grandmother was rich why didn&#x2019;t they have any money? &#x2018;I eloped,&#x2019; their mother said. &#x2018;I ran away to marry your father. It was very romantic. At the time. We had nothing.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;You had the picnic basket,&#x2019; Jessica said and their mother laughed and said, &#x2018;You can be very funny, you know,&#x2019; and Jessica said, &#x2018;I do know.&#x2019;<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Dubliners (Wordsworth Classics)</h2><p><b>Introduction and Notes by Laurence Davies, Dartmouth College, New Hampshire.</b><p>Living overseas but writing, always, about his native city, Joyce made Dublin unforgettable.

During the years when Brazil, India, China and the other emerging markets&#x201d; have transformed their economies, Africa's resource states remained tethered to the bottom of the industrial supply chain. While Africa accounts for about 30 per cent of the world's reserves of hydrocarbons and minerals and 14 per cent of the world's population, its share of global manufacturing stood in 2011 exactly where it stood in 2000: at 1 percent.<br><br>In his first book, <i>The Looting Machine</i>, Tom Burgis exposes the truth about the African development miracle: for the resource states, it's a mirage. The oil, copper, diamonds, gold and coltan deposits attract a global network of traders, bankers, corporate extractors and investors who combine with venal political cabals to loot the states' value. And the vagaries of resource-dependent economies could pitch Africa's new middle class back into destitution just as quickly as they climbed out of it. The ground beneath their feet is as precarious as a Congolese mine shaft; their prosperity could spill away like crude from a busted pipeline.<br><br>This catastrophic social disintegration is not merely a continuation of Africa's past as a colonial victim. The looting now is accelerating as never before. As global demand for Africa's resources rises, a handful of Africans are becoming legitimately rich but the vast majority, like the continent as a whole, is being fleeced. Outsiders tend to think of Africa as a great drain of philanthropy. But look more closely at the resource industry and the relationship between Africa and the rest of the world looks rather different. In 2010, fuel and mineral exports from Africa were worth 333 billion, more than seven times the value of the aid that went in the opposite direction. But who received the money? For every Frenchwoman who dies in childbirth, 100 die in Niger alone, the former French colony whose uranium fuels France's nuclear reactors. In petro-states like Angola three-quarters of government revenue comes from oil. The government is not funded by the people, and as result it is not beholden to them. A score of African countries whose economies depend on resources are rentier states; their people are largely serfs. The resource curse is not merely some unfortunate economic phenomenon, the product of an intangible force. What is happening in Africa's resource states is systematic looting. Like its victims, its beneficiaries have names.<br></p><p>Tom Burgis has been tenacious and intrepid in confronting the powerful vested interests &#x2013; corporate, military, financial and political &#x2013; that have fed to excess off Africa's riches. He has been reporting for the <i>Financial Times</i> for the last eight years, writing a series of prizewinning investigative reports from Johannesburg and Lagos. He was the winner of the FT's second annual Jones-Mauthner Memorial Prize for his superb reporting and expos�s of corruption, and the Jerwood Award for a nonfiction book in progress for <i>The Looting Machine</i>. He was shortlisted as a young journalist of the year for his Africa reports. This is his first book."A great scrapbook of exploitation. It is written in a way that will appeal to the general reader, but still interest specialists...Burgis has the good sense not to present [the cruel contrast between individual poverty and national wealth] in an alarmist way, but with an understatement that is far more powerful...<i>The Looting Machine</i> is in part a means of self-exoneration, a way of making amends to those he ultimately could not help...[in this book] has done a service to some of the world's poorest people." <i><b>Financial Times</b></i><br><br>"[An] excellent, finely reported book...The great value of <i>The Looting Machine</i> lies in its fresh detail, storytelling and the characters Burgis introduces. <i>The Looting Machine</i> is crammed with colour and lively investigative reporting." <i><b>Literary Review</b></i> (UK)<br><br>"Revealing...Burgis explains lucidly how the oil and mineral bonanza subverts societies and corrupts western multinational companies trying to cash in...[He] is particularly acute in analysing how multinationals connive in this institutionalised theft This intelligent book should give us all pause for thought when we fill our cars with petrol." <b><i>The Sunday Times</i></b> (UK)<br><br><b>One of Financial Times' Books of the Year, 2015</b><br><br>"...a brave and defiant book." <b><i>New York Times</i> Sunday Book Review</b><br><br>"...powerful new book." <b>Nicholas Kristof, <i>New York Times</i> columnist</b><br><br> [an] impressive study It is to Mr. Burgis's tremendous credit that he writes with such tenacity.&#x201d; <b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>"[Burgis] presents a lively portrait of the rapacious 'looting machine'...a rich collage of examples showing the links between corrupt companies and African elites." <b><i>The Economist</i></b><br><br> [Burgis] brings the tools of an investigative reporter and the sensibility of a foreign correspondent [He] transcends the tired binary debate about the root causes of the continent's misery.&#x201d; <b>Howard French, <i>Foreign Affairs</i></b><br><br>"Essential for understanding the colonial Africa of the past and, even more so, the diverse Africa of today." <b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>"A brave, excoriating expos� of the systematic ruination of resource-rich countries of Africa, leaving "penury and strife" for its millions of inhabitants...An earnest, eye-opening, important account for Western readers." <b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i> STARRED</b><br><br>"[Burgis] makes a powerful case, through anecdote and evidence, that the dirty trade in raw materials serves individuals' own enrichment and the demands of oligarchic and state interests worldwide." <b><i>The Times</i></b> (UK)<br><br>"After nine years reporting on Africa for the <i>Financial Times</i>, Tom Burgis exposes how the extractive industries have turned into a hideous looting machine [an] informative book.&#x201d; <b><i>The Guardian</i></b> (UK)<br><br>"Burgis shows how even the World Bank is linked to this looting [of Africa, and he] makes an important case colourfully, convincingly and at times courageously as he confronts some of those involved in the pillaging." <b><i>Observer</i></b> (UK)<br><br>"Brilliant fascinating detail The book lives up to its colourful subtitle Warlords, tycoons, smugglers and the systematic theft of Africa's wealth&#x201d;. Showing the finesse and determination that has won him awards at the FT, and at considerable risk to his own well-being, Burgis tracks down and confronts the people at the centre of this plunder." <b>African Research Institute</b><br><br>"A rollercoaster read. Filled with vignettes on spooks, smugglers and kleptocratic warlords with suitcases of cash, it reads like a crime thriller, while at the same time being a well-researched, accessible account of the extractives industry; the privatisation of power in Africa and its impact on the continent's people." <b>African Arguments</b><br><br>"This fine book...catalogues the grotesque self-enrichment of the callous rulers of Angola, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria countries that should be immensely wealthy, but which remain poor, even by African standards.

Burgis's book is essential to understanding why poverty, ignorance and conflict persist in Africa." <b>Independent Catholic News</b><br><br>"An excellent book. Despite Africa's impressive economic 5% growth rate, Tom Burgis ensures that we don't stop wondering who does what in Africa and how we are all party to what Western investors&#x201d; are up to.

And what do they get for it? Statistically, not much. Americans today live shorter, less healthy lives than citizens of other rich countries, and these trends show no signs of letting up.<br><br>The problem, Sandro Galea argues, is that Americans focus on the wrong things when they think about health. Our national understanding of what constitutes "being well" is centered on medicine -- the lifestyles we adopt to stay healthy, and the insurance plans and prescriptions we fall back on when we're not. While all these things are important, they've not proven to be the difference between healthy and unhealthy on the large scale. <br><br><em>Well</em> is a radical examination of the subtle and not-so-subtle factors that determine who gets to be healthy in America. Galea shows how the country's failing health is a product of American history and character -- and how refocusing on our national health can usher enlightenment across American life and politics.<br></p><p><br><strong>Sandro Galea</strong> is Dean and Robert A. Knox Professor at the Boston University School of Public Health. He has been named an "epidemiology innovator" by <em>Time</em> and one of the "World's Most Influential Scientific Minds" by <em>Thomson Reuters</em>. A native of Malta, he has served as a field physician for Doctors Without Borders and held academic positions at Columbia University, University of Michigan, and the New York Academy of Medicine.

Peters, <em>Health Affairs</em><p></p><br>"A deeply affecting work from one of the important and innovative voices in American health and medicine. <em>Well</em> shows how healthcare and society are reflections of one another -- and how central human qualities like empathy and compassion must be if both are going to thrive." -- <strong>Arianna Huffington</strong>, Founder of <em>HuffPost</em> and Founder &amp; CEO of Thrive Global<p></p><br>"For 45 years I have fought for equity, compassion, and inclusion in mental health, so I am thrilled to see Sandro Galea's <em>Well</em> take the revolutionary and compelling stance that these principles can have a more beneficial effect upon public health than any scientific discovery." -- <strong>Rosalynn Carter</strong>, former First Lady<p></p><br>"A radical new perspective on the true drivers of health -- and a set of truly disruptive conclusions to inspire those designing health systems.

First published in 1870, <i>The Wild Garden</i> evolved through many editions and remained in print through the remainder of the author's lifetime (1838-1935). In the book, Robinson issued a forceful challenge to the prevailing style of the day, which relied upon tender plants arranged in rigidly geometrical designs. In sharp contrast, Robinson advocated for the use of hardy, locally adapted native and exotic plants arranged according to local growing conditions. Robinson's vision was inspired by his first-hand observations of natural habitats in Europe and North America, and he put his ideas into practice in his own garden at Gravetye Manor in West Sussex. <i>The Wild Garden</i> was ground-breaking and hugely influential in its day, and is stunningly relevant to twenty-first century gardeners and landscape stewards seeking to adopt sustainable design and management practices.<br> <br> In addition to the complete original text and illustrations from the fifth edition of 1895, this expanded edition includes new chapters and 125 color photographs by award-winning photographer and landscape consultant Rick Darke. His new material places wild gardening in modern context, underscoring Robinson's importance in the evolution of ecological design and illustrating an inspiring diversity of contemporary wild gardens.<br>William Robinson (1838&#x2013;1935) emigrated from Ireland at a young age and was rapidly welcomed into the top echelons of British horticulture and botany. By 1866 he was a Fellow in the Linnean Society, sponsored by his friend Charles Darwin. Already an expert on the flora of the British Isles, he traveled the breadth of North America by train in 1870, observing regional habitats and forging lasting connections with Charles Sargent, Asa Gray, Frederick Law Olmsted, and others of their stature. Robinson was just thirty-two when he first published <i>The Wild Garden</i>, which has proved to be the most insightful, influential, and enduring of his many books and journals. Robinson's brilliance and enormous personal energy enabled him to become one of the most accomplished gardeners, editors, and publishers of his era, and he is often referred to as the Father of the English Flower Garden. Gravetye Manor, a sixteenth-century house which survives on over one-thousand acres in West Sussex, became his home and laboratory for developing and refining the wild garden concept.<br><br><p>Rick Darke&nbsp;is a landscape design consultant, author, lecturer, and photographer based in Pennsylvania who blends art, ecology, and cultural geography in the creation and conservation of livable landscapes. His projects include scenic byways, public gardens, corporate and collegiate campuses, mixed-use conservation developments, and residential gardens. Darke served on the staff of Longwood Gardens for twenty years&nbsp;and received the Scientific Award of the American Horticultural Society.

The judge&#x2019;s cook watches over her distractedly, for his thoughts are often on his son, Biju, who is hopscotching from one gritty New York restaurant to another. Kiran Desai&#x2019;s brilliant novel, published to huge acclaim, is a story of joy and despair. Her characters face numerous choices that majestically illuminate the consequences of colonialism as it collides with the modern world.</p><p><b>Kiran Desai</b> was born in India in 1971. Her last book was the critically acclaimed <i>Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard.</i> Educated in India, England, and the United States, she continues, like the characters in this book, to divide her time between places, with mixed results.<p>One<br> <br></p><p><i>All day,</i> the colors had been those of dusk, mist moving like a water creature across the great flanks of mountains possessed of ocean shadows and depths. Briefly visible above the vapor, Kanchenjunga was a far peak whittled out of ice, gathering the last of the light, a plume of snow blown high by the storms at its summit.<br> <br></p><p>Sai, sitting on the veranda, was reading an article about giant squid in an old <i>National Geographic.</i> Every now and then she looked up at Kanchenjunga, observed its wizard phosphorescence with a shiver. The judge sat at the far corner with his chessboard, playing against himself. Stuffed under his chair where she felt safe was Mutt the dog, snoring gently in her sleep. A single bald lightbulb dangled on a wire above. It was cold, but inside the house, it was still colder, the dark, the freeze, contained by stone walls several feet deep.</p><p><br> Here, at the back, inside the cavernous kitchen, was the cook, trying to light the damp wood. He fingered the kindling gingerly for fear of the community of scorpions living, loving, reproducing in the pile. Once he'd found a mother, plump with poison, fourteen babies on her back.</p><p><br> Eventually, the fire caught and he placed his kettle on top, as battered, as encrusted as something dug up by an archeological team, and waited for it to boil. The walls were singed and sodden, garlic hung by muddy stems from the charred beams, thickets of soot clumped batlike upon the ceiling. The flame cast a mosaic of shiny orange across the cook's face, and his top half grew hot, but a mean gust tortured his arthritic knees.</p><p><br> Up through the chimney and out, the smoke mingled with the mist that was gathering speed, sweeping in thicker and thicker, obscuring things in parts&#x2014;half a hill, then the other half. The trees turned into silhouettes, loomed forth, were submerged again. Gradually the vapor replaced everything with itself, solid objects with shadow, and nothing remained that did not seem molded from or inspired by it. Sai's breath flew from her nostrils in drifts, and the diagram of a giant squid constructed from scraps of information, scientists&#x2019; dreams, sank entirely into the murk.</p><p><br> She shut the magazine and walked out into the garden. The forest was old and thick at the edge of the lawn; the bamboo thickets rose thirty feet into the gloom; the trees were moss-slung giants, bunioned and misshapen, tentacled with the roots of orchids. The caress of the mist through her hair seemed human, and when she held her fingers out, the vapor took them gently into its mouth. She thought of Gyan, the mathematics tutor, who should have arrived an hour ago with his algebra book.</p><p><br> But it was 4:30 already and she excused him with the thickening mist. When she looked back, the house was gone; when she climbed the steps back to the veranda, the garden vanished. The judge had fallen asleep and gravity acting upon the slack muscles, pulling on the line of his mouth, dragging on his cheeks, showed Sai exactly what he would look like if he were dead.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Where is the tea?&#x201d; he woke and demanded of her. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s late,&#x201d; said the judge, meaning the cook with the tea, not Gyan.</p><p><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get it,&#x201d; she offered.</p><p><br> The gray had permeated inside, as well, settling on the silverware, nosing the corners, turning the mirror in the passageway to cloud. Sai, walking to the kitchen, caught a glimpse of herself being smothered and reached forward to imprint her lips upon the surface, a perfectly formed film star kiss. &#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; she said, half to herself and half to someone else.</p><p><br> No human had ever seen an adult giant squid alive, and though they had eyes as big as apples to scope the dark of the ocean, theirs was a solitude so profound they might never encounter another of their tribe. The melancholy of this situation washed over Sai.</p><p>Could fulfillment ever be felt as deeply as loss? Romantically she decided that love must surely reside in the gap between desire and fulfillment, in the lack, not the contentment. Love was the ache, the anticipation, the retreat, everything around it but the emotion itself.</p><p>---</p><p>The water boiled and the cook lifted the kettle and emptied it into the teapot.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Terrible,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;My bones ache so badly, my joints hurt&#x2014;I may as well be dead. If not for Biju. . . .&#x201d; Biju was his son in America. He worked at Don Pollo&#x2014;or was it The Hot Tomato? Or Ali Baba's Fried Chicken? His father could not remember or understand or pronounce the names, and Biju changed jobs so often, like a fugitive on the run&#x2014;no papers.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s so foggy,&#x201d; Sai said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think the tutor will come.&#x201d; She jigsawed the cups, saucers, teapot, milk, sugar, strainer, Marie and Delite biscuits all to fit upon the tray.</p><p><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take it,&#x201d; she offered.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Careful, careful,&#x201d; he said scoldingly, following with an enamel basin of milk for Mutt. Seeing Sai swim forth, spoons making a jittery music upon the warped sheet of tin, Mutt raised her head. &#x201c;Teatime?&#x201d; said her eyes as her tail came alive.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Why is there nothing to eat?&#x201d; the judge asked, irritated, lifting his nose from a muddle of pawns in the center of the chessboard. He looked, then, at the sugar in the pot: dirty, micalike glinting granules. The biscuits looked like cardboard and there were dark finger marks on the white of the saucers. Never ever was the tea served the way it should be, but he demanded at least a cake or scones, macaroons or cheese straws. Something sweet and something salty. This was a travesty and it undid the very concept of teatime.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Only biscuits,&#x201d; said Sai to his expression. &#x201c;The baker left for his daughter&#x2019;s wedding.&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want biscuits.&#x201d;</p><p><br> Sai sighed.</p><p><br> &#x201c;How dare he go for a wedding? Is that the way to run a business? The fool. Why can&#x2019;t the cook make something?&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no more gas, no kerosene.&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;Why the hell can&#x2019;t he make it over wood? All these old cooks can make cakes perfectly fine by building coals around a tin box. You think they used to have gas stoves, kerosene stoves, before? Just too lazy now.&#x201d;</p><p><br> The cook came hurrying out with the leftover chocolate pudding warmed on the fire in a frying pan, and the judge ate the lovely brown puddle and gradually his face took on an expression of grudging pudding contentment.</p><p><br> They sipped and ate, all of existence passed over by nonexistence, the gate leading nowhere, and they watched the tea spill copious ribbony curls of vapor, watched their breath join the mist slowly twisting and turning, twisting and turning.</p><p><br> ---</p><p>Nobody noticed the boys creeping across the grass, not even Mutt, until they were practically up the steps. Not that it mattered, for there were no latches to keep them out and nobody within calling distance except Uncle Potty on the other side of the <i>jhora</i> ravine, who would be drunk on the floor by this hour, lying still but feeling himself pitch about&#x2014;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mind me, love,&#x201d; he always told Sai after a drinking bout, opening one eye like an owl, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just lie down right here and take a little rest&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p><br> They had come through the forest on foot, in leather jackets from the Kathmandu black market, khaki pants, bandanas&#x2014;universal guerilla fashion.<br> <br> One of the boys carried a gun.</p><p><br> Later reports accused China, Pakistan, and Nepal, but in this part of the world, as in any other, there were enough weapons floating around for an impoverished movement with a ragtag army. They were looking for anything they could find&#x2014;kukri sickles, axes, kitchen knives, spades, any kind of firearm.</p><p><br> They had come for the judge&#x2019;s hunting rifles.</p><p><br> Despite their mission and their clothes, they were unconvincing. The oldest of them looked under twenty, and at one yelp from Mutt, they screamed like a bunch of schoolgirls, retreated down the steps to cower behind the bushes blurred by mist. &#x201c;Does she <i>bite,</i> Uncle? <i>My God!</i>&#x201d;&#x2014; shivering there in their camouflage.</p><p><br> Mutt began to do what she always did when she met strangers: she turned a furiously wagging bottom to the intruders and looked around from behind, smiling, conveying both shyness and hope.</p><p><br> Hating to see her degrade herself thus, the judge reached for her, whereupon she buried her nose in his arms.</p><p><br> The boys came back up the steps, embarrassed, and the judge became conscious of the fact that this embarrassment was dangerous for had the boys projected unwavering confidence, they might have been less inclined to flex their muscles.</p><p><br> The one with the rifle said something the judge could not understand.</p><p><br> &#x201c;No Nepali?&#x201d; he spat, his lips sneering to show what he thought of that, but he continued in Hindi. &#x201c;Guns?&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;We have no guns here.&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;Get them.&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;You must be misinformed.&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;Never mind with all this <i>nakhra.</i> Get them.&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;I order you,&#x201d; said the judge, &#x201c;to leave my property at once.&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;Bring the weapons.&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;I will call the police.&#x201d;</p><p><br> This was a ridiculous threat as there was no telephone.</p><p><br> They laughed a movie laugh, and then, also as if in a movie, the boy with the rifle pointed his gun at Mutt. &#x201c;Go on, get them, or we will kill the dog first and you second, cook third, ladies last,&#x201d; he said, smiling at Sai.</p><p><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get them,&#x201d; she said in terror and overturned the tea tray as she went.</p><p><br> The judge sat with Mutt in his lap. The guns dated from his days in the Indian Civil Service. A BSA five-shot barrel pump gun, a .30 Springfield rifle, and a double-barreled rifle, Holland &amp; Holland. They weren&#x2019;t even locked away: they were mounted at the end of the hall above a dusty row of painted green and brown duck decoys.</p><p><br> &#x201c;<i>Chtch,</i> all rusted. Why don&#x2019;t you take care of them?&#x201d; But they were pleased and their bravado bloomed. &#x201c;We will join you for tea.&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;Tea?&#x201d; asked Sai in numb terror.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Tea and snacks. Is this how you treat guests? Sending us back out into the cold with nothing to warm us up.&#x201d; They looked at one another, at her, looked up, down, and winked.</p><p><br> She felt intensely, fearfully female.</p><p><br> Of course, all the boys were familiar with movie scenes where hero and heroine, befeathered in cosy winterwear, drank tea served in silver tea sets by polished servants. Then the mist would roll in, just as it did in reality, and they sang and danced, playing peekaboo in a nice resort hotel. This was classic cinema set in Kulu-Manali or, in preterrorist days, Kashmir, before gunmen came bounding out of the mist and a new kind of film had to be made.</p><p><br> The cook was hiding under the dining table and they dragged him out.</p><p><i><br> &#x201c;Ai aaa, ai aaa,&#x201d;</i> he joined his palms together, begging them, &#x201c;please, I&#x2019;m a poor man, please.&#x201d; He held up his arms and cringed as if from an expected blow.</p><p><br> &#x201c;He hasn&#x2019;t done anything, leave him,&#x201d; said Sai, hating to see him humiliated, hating even more to see that the only path open to him was to humiliate himself further.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Please living only to see my son please don't kill me please <i>I&#x2019;m a poor man spare me.</i>&#x201d;</p><p><br> His lines had been honed over centuries, passed down through generations, for poor people needed certain lines; the script was always the same, and they had no option but to beg for mercy. The cook knew instinctively how to cry.</p><p><br> These familiar lines allowed the boys to ease still further into their role, which he had handed to them like a gift.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Who wants to kill you?&#x201d; they said to the cook. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re just hungry, that&#x2019;s all. Here, your sahib will help you. Go on,&#x201d; they said to the judge, &#x201c;you know how it should be done properly.&#x201d; The judge didn&#x2019;t move, so the boy pointed the gun at Mutt again.</p><p><br> The judge grabbed her and put her behind him.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Too soft-hearted, sahib. You should show this kind side to your guests, also. Go on, prepare the table.&#x201d;</p><p><br> The judge found himself in the kitchen where he had never been, not once, Mutt wobbling about his toes, Sai and the cook too scared to look, averting their gaze.</p><p><br> It came to them that they might all die with the judge in the kitchen; the world was upside down and absolutely anything could happen.</p></p><h2>Know Thyself</h2><p>How wonderful it is to taught by a free teacher, a spiritual teacher, a member of our family who truly loves the family, an architect of tranforming processes, a defender of African people, a beacon, a Son of Africa, a divine spirit manisfesting our creative genius.

Mid-century ranches (1946-1970) range from the decidedly modern gable-roofed Joseph Eichler tracts in the San Francisco Bay area and butterfly wing houses in Palm Springs, Florida, to the unassuming brick or stucco L-shaped ranches and split-levels so common throughout the United States. Authors Michelle Gringeri-Brown and Jim Brown, founders and publishers of the popular quarterly Atomic Ranch magazine, extol the virtues of the tract, split-level, rambler home and its many unique qualities: private front facades, open floor plans, secluded bedroom wings, walls of glass, and an easy-living lifestyle. From updated homes with high-end Italian kitchens, terrazzo floors, and modern furniture to affordable homeowner renovations with eclectic thrift-store furnishings, Atomic Ranch presents twenty-five homes showcasing inspiring examples of stylish living through beautiful color photographs, including before and after shots, design-tip sidebars, and a thorough resource index. </p> <p>Atomic Ranch reveals: </p> <p>Hallmarks of the ranch style</p> <p>Inspiring original ranch homes</p> <p>Ranch house transformations and makeovers</p> <p>Preservation of mid-century neighborhoods</p> <p>Adding personality to a ranch home </p> <p>Yards and landscaping </p> <p>Plus, a helpful resource section and index!</p></p><p><p>Atomic Ranch</p> <p>At the close of World War II, during a time when the United States was suffused with optimism about the future, America began a love affair with the ranch house that lasted for the next twenty-five years. From the decidedly modern gable-roofed Joseph Eichler tracts in the San Francisco Bay area and butterfly wing houses in Palm Springs and Sarasota, Florida, to the unassuming brick or stucco L-shaped ranches and split-levels we see every day, midcentury ranches can be found all over the country. </p> <p>Today there is a growing new enthusiasm for ranch houses and the midcentury furnishings that go with them. Atomic Ranch illustrates in stunning color photography the virtues of the ranch house, often decried as "cookie cutter," and shows why these homes worked so well for their first residents and still function beautifully today. With private front facades, open floor plans, secluded bedroom wings, and walls of glass that bring the outside in, midcentury ranches mix function, comfort, and style with ease. Instead of trying to turn your ranch house into a bungalow, Spanish adobe or two-story Tuscan villa, why not let it be what it was meant to be-a modest one-story house with a casual, comfortable lifestyle. </p> <p>From updated homes with high-end Italian kitchens, terrazzo floors, and modern furniture to affordable homeowner renovations with eclectic thrift-store furnishings, Atomic Ranch presents plenty of inspiring examples of stylish living in America's favorite house.</p><p>Writer Michelle Gringeri-Brown and photographer Jim Brown publish the quarterly magazine Atomic Ranch, which features ranch homes built all across America.

This translation will stand as the perfect rendering of a classic work.&#x201d;&#x2014;John Haynes Holmes <br><br> Lao Tzu was one of the greatest mystics of all time. Legend tells us that he was immaculately conceived by a shooting star. Confucius, who met him only once, likened him to a dragon, the one creature in all creation whose ways he would never understand. <br> Some hold that Lao Tzu was not one man but many men, and the work attributed to him, the <i>Tao Teh Ching</i>, the product of many minds over many centuries. <br><br> But whether or not <i>the Tao Teh Ching</i>, here presented as <i>The Way of Life</i>, is the author&#x2019;s own matters little. From its original in sixth-century B.C. China it has come down to us as one of the most powerful testaments ever written to man&#x2019;s fitness in the universe. The basis of Taoism, one of the world&#x2019;s great religions, the <i>Tao Teh Ching </i>has been translated more frequently than any other work besides the Bible. Articulating the way of poise, serenity, and complete assurance, it teaches us how to work with the invisible forces of nature, the psyche, and the soul for a more successful life. Not passive contemplation, but creative quietism is the Way of Lao Tzu, and it has never been more relevant than it is today.</p><p><b>Witter Bynner</b>&nbsp;was an American poet, scholar, translator, and writer.

He lives in an old house built on an Indian mound in Pineland, Florida.*Starred Review* Now in its eleventh episode, White's Doc Ford series, starring Sanibel Island marine biologist and veteran special-ops agent Doc Ford, can always be counted on for an entertaining mix of character interplay and straight-ahead action adventure. This time the dial shifts a bit toward the character side of the scale, as Ford revisits various people and issues from his not-quite-past life as a covert operative. The catalyst for all this stock-taking is the kidnapping of the son Ford only recently learned he had and the resurfacing of Pilar, the boy's mother and the great love of Ford's life. The kidnapping plot, in which Ford, with the help of hippie pal Tomlinson, must rescue his son from a serious psycho who likes to burn people, keeps the suspense churning, but the real focus here--for longtime series followers, at least--is on what this latest crisis means to Ford's life with the people he cares about: his son, girlfriend Dewey, the troubled Pilar, and especially Tomlinson, who has his own dark past. As always in White's work, the various bodies of water that surround and intersect Florida take on the multidimensional qualities of fully developed characters, adding not only atmosphere but also context to Ford's ongoing struggle to achieve in his human relationships the sense of equilibrium he has found in the natural world. He's not there yet, but for the reader at least, that's good news: this story is a long way from over. <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The tragic&nbsp;story&nbsp;of Firestone&#x2019;s own family lays the groundwork for these revealing testimonies&nbsp;of recovery, forgiveness, and moral leadership.&nbsp;Throughout, Firestone interweaves their voices with neuroscientific and psychological findings, as well as relevant and inspiring Jewish teachings.</p> <p>Seven principles emerge from these wise narratives&#x2015;powerful prescriptive tools that speak to anyone dealing with the effects of past injury.

Leaving home, she embarked upon a life-changing spiritual odyssey that she chronicled in <i>With Roots in Heaven: One Woman&#x2019;s Passionate Journey into the Heart of Her Faith</i>. After immersing herself in a wide variety of spiritual practices and worldviews, Firestone returned with fresh vigor to become a rabbi in a pluralistic and egalitarian Judaism. </p> <p>Now Rabbi Emerita, Firestone&#x2019;s research on the transformation of collective trauma draws on the fields of neuroscience, psychology, and Jewish literature. Through interviews, case studies, and autobiographical stories, she demonstrates how trauma residue passes from generation to generation and how it can be transformed.</p><p>"<i>Wounds into Wisdom</i> is for anyone who has suffered trauma, either directly or in a family whose generational trauma is buried.

As a result, trauma can lodge in the body or the unconscious, and, as Tirzah Firestone writes in this compelling book, can be passed unknowingly from generation to generation, 'like a train depositing its load, car after car, into our newborn skin.' The power of this book is in the stories she relates of people who&#x2019;ve suffered extreme pain, faced it head-on, and found a path to healing.

She offers us the wisdom of a compassionate therapist whose understanding is broad and deep. But she also offers us the spiritual perspective of a rabbi who has found her way to the deeper currents of Jewish understanding. Running through <i>Wounds Into Wisdom</i> and binding it is an autobiographical account of her own family's trauma. That account is powerful in itself but it is also empowering&#x2014;we can feel how the author has herself lived through trauma, and has even found her way to become a great healer and teacher.

While the children and grandchildren may not have a direct experience of the initial ordeal, its effects can continue to impact their lives significantly; so much so that they carry the burden of an unnamed survivor's guilt. The mentality of 'never forget' morphs into a place of keeping the trauma alive. Rabbi and psychotherapist Firestone considers the suffering experienced by an entire ethnic group: specifically, Jews in the aftermath of the Holocaust as well as Jews caught in the violence of ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. Of her own life, the author remarks, '..I comprehended just how a family's ancestral trauma rumbles through history like a train, depositing its load, car after car, into our newborn skin.' In her experience, silence becomes weaponized, freezing spouses, children, and grandchildren in time, without redemption. Culling together a multiplicity of narratives, Firestone offers seven principles focused on facing and transforming family grief into a coherent, powerful sense of agency. <b>VERDICT</b> Combining religion and self-help, these timely reflections make for comforting reading." &#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i>, Sandra Collins, Byzantine Catholic Seminary Lib., Pittsburgh</p></p><h2>Bears: Polar Bears, Black Bears and Grizzly Bears (Kids Can Press Wildlife Series)</h2><p>The eating habits of bears is one of 14 topics in this clearly written look at three North American bears -- grizzly bears, polar bears and black bears.

Drawing on diverse theological, philosophical, and anthropological insights, it offers fresh ways to evaluate food production and consumption practices as they are being worked out in today&#39;s industrial food economy. Unlike books that focus primarily on vegetarianism and hunger-related concerns, this book broadens the scope of consideration to include the sacramental character of eating, the deep significance of hospitality, the meaning of death and sacrifice, the Eucharist as the place of inspiration and orientation, the importance of saying grace, and the possibility of eating in heaven. Throughout, eating is presented as a way of enacting fidelity between persons, between people and fellow creatures, and between people and Earth. Food and Faith demonstrates that eating is of profound economic, moral, and spiritual significance. Revised throughout, this edition includes a new introduction and two chapters, as well as updated bibliography. The additions add significantly to the core idea of creaturely membership and hospitality through discussion of the microbiome revolution in science, and the daunting challenge of the Anthropocene.</p><p>This edition of the go-to book on theology and food expands key insights on the spirituality of eating, the importance of good agricultural practice, and the prospects of convivial and healthy communities.

Ehrman published How Jesus Became God: The Exaltation of a Jewish Preacher from Galilee. In it, he posits that the concept of Jesus as God evolved over time. Five biblical scholars gather here to refute that theory. Although it&#x2019;s preferable to have read Ehrman&#x2019;s book before tackling this one, the authors do a relatively even-handed job of stating Ehrman&#x2019;s case before attempting to demolish it. The topics they discuss include divinization in the ancient world, the Christological claims of the synoptic Gospels, and burial practices at the time of Jesus&#x2019; death (even those sympathetic to Ehrman&#x2019;s case would probably agree that his discussion of the empty tomb contains too much conjecture.) This book, while putting forth arguments well worth examining, is weakened by the fact it contains five voices, and dry, scholarly ones at that. Ehrman has mastered the art of writing in a style suitable for general audiences, making his book more accessible. Still, the two deserve consideration together, and the publisher of this volume has cleverly used a cover image in the same style and color as Ehrman&#x2019;s book, which may help lead interested readers in the right direction. --Ilene Cooper</p><h2>Phoenix Claws and Jade Trees: Essential Techniques of Authentic Chinese Cooking: A Cookbook</h2><p><b>Create nuanced, complex, authentic Chinese flavors at home by learning the cuisine's fundamental techniques.</b><br><b>&nbsp; </b><br><b>Winner of the 2016 IACP Julia Child First Book Award</b><br><br><i>Phoenix Claws and Jade Trees</i> offers a unique introduction to Chinese home cooking, demystifying it by focusing on its basic cooking methods. In outlining the differences among various techniques--such as pan-frying, oil steeping, and yin-yang frying--and instructing which one is best for particular ingredients and end results, culinary expert Kian Lam Kho provides a practical, intuitive window into this unique cuisine.

He lives in New York City.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>Phoenix claws and jade trees are poetic metonyms, or metaphorical substitutions, you&#x2019;ll find on many Chinese restaurant menus. &#x201c;Phoenix claw&#x201d; is a synonym for chicken feet, and &#x201c;jade tree&#x201d; is used for <i>gailan</i>, or Chinese broccoli. To most Chinese diners, this is familiar terminology, and I grew up learning it naturally at daily meals. But for many Westerners, authentic Chinese cuisine remains just out of reach linguistically and geographically. Yet with so many ingredients readily available and a wok just one click away online, it&#x2019;s time to extend these thrilling and transportive flavors to eager home cooks everywhere. <br><br>In this book I demystify Chinese cooking by taking a unique approach. I believe that the cuisine is easiest to learn by technique. A dry stir-fry is no more difficult to prepare than a moist one; the key is to know which technique to use for which ingredient and for which final result. Armed with this knowledge, you can not only re-create dishes from all over China and many East Asian countries, but you can cook almost any ingredient in any fashion you&#x2019;d like. If you discover you love dry stir-fry with leeks and you are wild about duck, you can combine the two to make a successful Chinese dish all your own. <br><br>As China opens up to the world, her emigrants bring many regional cooking traditions to their adopted countries. They introduce new ingredients and open restaurants to satisfy their longing for food from home. At the same time, Western expatriates flock to China as companies from all over the world scramble to do business there. After short stints in China they return home, yearning to re-create the incredible array of food they experienced abroad. <br><br>This confluence of immigration and business travel creates new demands and sets higher standards for authentic Chinese food outside China. No longer are we satisfied with Beef with Broccoli and General Tso&#x2019;s Chicken. We now demand Xinjiang Lamb Burgers and Lan Zhou Pulled Noodles. From New York to Melbourne, people are curious about authentic Chinese food. <br><br>My own experience of cooking Chinese food in America parallels the narrative of these new Chinese immigrants. Arriving in America from Singapore in the 1970s to attend university in Boston, I longed for the abundance of wonderful food from home. At that time most restaurants in town were still serving up chop suey and other substandard Cantonese fare. My only defense against bad Chinese food was to cook at home. Unable to find a good Chinese cookbook, I resorted to writing home to my aunts and other relatives for instructions and recipes. <br><br>Over the years I mastered techniques and developed recipes that helped me in my kitchen. I found that by taking one technique and switching up the ingredients, I could make an entirely new dish typical of a different region. Once I had the many methods under my belt, I could make almost anything. I hope this book will help illuminate fundamental Chinese cooking methods for the Western cook and make this fascinating cuisine practical to prepare at home. <br><br>Thus, the chapters here are organized according to cooking methods rather than the usual division by ingredients or region. Some techniques are defined by heat sources. Cooking with oil, for example, is divided into five techniques: light frying, deep-frying, oil steeping, yin-yang frying, and panfrying. The procedures are different but all use oil as the heat medium. This approach can greatly facilitate the learning of a cuisine by identifying similarities and differences among related techniques. <br><br>Although the preparation methods outlined in this book are based on a comprehensive set of Chinese&nbsp;cooking techniques, I have kept the home cook in mind and have thus omitted some seldom-used ones. Many of these omitted techniques simply put too fine a point on a general method. For example, pan-frying in Chinese can be minutely defined in three ways: jian, tie, and ta, depending on whether the ingredient is fried whole, cut into pieces, or covered in batter. Since the technique is fundamentally the same, I combine them into pan-frying. <br><br>The recipes include many classic home-style and restaurant dishes, appropriate for everyday family meals as well as elaborate banquets. They illustrate the cooking techniques rather than a specific regional cuisine, though the region where each recipe originated is identified when appropriate.<br><br>A fundamental Chinese cookbook would not be complete without references to history and culture. You&#x2019;ll find a discussion of regional flavors as well as sections on dining customs, pantry ingredients, and kitchen tools. I also include common ingredient preparation and knife techniques. If you are already familiar with Chinese food, you may choose to skip these sections. They can, however, be entertaining reading while you wait for your braised chicken to cook. <br><br>Be adventurous with the techniques and ingredients you&#x2019;ll find in these pages. Don&#x2019;t be daunted by the technical details. They are there to help you to understand the theory and allow you to be creative. Above all, have fun learning the world of classic Chinese cooking.<br><br><b>Simple Stir-Fry</b><br><br>At just about every meal in a Chinese household, there&#x2019;s a stir-fry of a single leafy vegetable, more often than not seasoned only with salt and white pepper&#x2014;no thickener, no soy sauce. Sliced ginger or garlic is just about all one would add to give it a little extra kick. This is what is known as simple stir-fry because it uses only a single main ingredient. <br><br>This emphasis on simplicity doesn&#x2019;t mean that you cannot add other, stronger-flavored ingredients to enhance a simple stir-fry. Fermented black beans, shrimp paste, and fermented tofu are often added at the end of the cooking process as part of the seasoning step. Perhaps the reason that Americans are not familiar with this technique is because Chinese restaurants rarely list simple stir-fries on their menus. A Chinese patron would normally ask the waiter or waitress what kind of green vegetables are in season and available in the kitchen, then order one for simple stir-fry. A few tips are in order to help you with simple stir-fry. When cooking leafy vegetables it is almost always sufficient to just let them cook in their own moisture, without covering the wok. However, when cooking vegetables that contain less moisture, such as legumes or gourds, you can add a few splashes of water or stock during cooking and cover the wok with a lid; repeat this a few times, stirring the vegetable each time, until cooked.<br><br><b>Garlic Stir-Fried Greens</b><br><br>This recipe can be used for cooking any leafy greens, such as spinach, bok choy, or chrysanthemum greens. I chose to use pea shoots here because they are my favorite. Pea shoots are the young leaves and tendrils of sweet peas. You can buy them very young as sprout-like greens, or most commonly as more mature but still tender leaves and tendrils. When buying pea shoots, be sure to select those with young tender leaves. Pea shoots are full of vitamins A and C and are an excellent source of fiber. <br><br>serves 2 or more, as a side dish <br><br>2 tablespoons vegetable oil <br>2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced <br>12 ounces pea shoots, cut into 2-inch pieces <br>1/2 teaspoon salt <br>1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper <br><br>1. Heat a wok over high heat until a droplet of water sizzles and evaporates immediately upon contact. Swirl the vegetable oil around the bottom and sides of the wok to coat it evenly. Add the garlic slices to the wok and stir-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the pea shoots and mix them in with the garlic. Cover the wok and let the vegetable steam for about 1 minute. <br><br>2. Uncover the wok and add the salt and pepper. Stir-fry for about 1 minute more. The vegetable is ready when the leaves are just wilted.<br>Stir-Frying Leafy Vegetables Evenly <br>Special steps should be taken when stir-frying leafy vegetables. In order to cook them evenly, cut the leaves from the stems and place them in separate containers. First cook the stems until they begin to sweat; then add the leaves and cook until completely done. Remember not to overcook vegetables&#x2014;this process may take just a few seconds.</p><h2>A Family of Poems: My Favorite Poetry for Children</h2><p>Caroline Kennedy has chosen a rich variety of Kennedy family favorite poems to include in this priceless collection. With thoughtful personal introductions written by Caroline herself, and beautiful new original artwork by award-winning artist, Jon J Muth, this collection is sure to become a family favorite for years to come.</p><p><br><strong>Caroline Kennedy</strong> is the editor of eight <i>New York Times </i>bestselling books on American history, politics, constitutional law and poetry, including <i>She Walks in Beauty: A Woman's Journey Through Poems </i>and <i>A Family of Poems</i>.<br><br><br><br><strong>Jon J Muth</strong> is the author and artist of the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller and Caldecott Honor book, <i>Zen Shorts</i>. He has illustrated many award-winning books, including another <i>New York Times</i> best-seller, <i>A Family of Poems</i>, by Caroline Kennedy He is also the writer and illustrator of <i>The Three Questions</i>, which the <i>New York Times</i> called "quietly life changing."The commercially important publishing categories sometimes overlap: the non-book and the celebrity book. The non-book is an object, with contents of little or no importance. The celebrity book is supposed to profit from association with a name customers recognize. But sometimes that recognizable name comes with a real book. Caroline Kennedy's excellent new anthology (illustrated by Jon J. Muth) is an excellent book. The editor shows great respect for children by choosing real poems and including Edward Lear, A.A. Milne, Robert Louis Stevenson, Walter de la Mare -- the first-class poets for children.<p> Kennedy also includes Emily Dickinson's " 'Hope' is the thing with feathers," Thomas Hardy's "Snow in the Suburbs," Wordsworth's "Daffodils," Shakespeare's song for Ariel, William Blake's "The Tyger," Elizabeth Bishop's "The Fish," Marianne Moore's "A Jelly-Fish," Theodore Roethke's "The Sloth," and William Butler Yeats's "The Lake Isle of Innisfree," along with good jokes by the likes of Dylan Thomas and Sylvia Plath and even Wallace Stevens's "The Emperor of Ice-Cream." Also, Antonio Machado's "Has My Heart Gone to Sleep," translated by Alan S. Trueblood:</p><p> Has my heart gone to sleep?<br>Have the beehives of my dreams <br>stopped working, the waterwheel <br>of the mind run dry, <br>scoops turning empty, <br>only shadow inside?</p><p> No, my heart is not asleep.<br>It is awake, wide awake.<br>Not asleep, not dreaming -- <br>its eyes are opened wide <br>watching distant signals, listening <br>on the rim of the vast silence.</p><p>The editor even includes, in an appendix, the text of this and all translated poems in their original languages.</p><p> Kennedy intelligently avoids (mostly) the cloying or over-ingratiating contemporary juvenile authors and includes good, sound, anonymous nonsense such as: </p><p>Moses</p><p>Moses supposes his toeses are roses, <br>But Moses supposes erroneously;<br>For nobody's toeses are posies of roses <br>As Moses supposes his toeses to be.</p><p>Also included are some good folk-sick-jokes, for example:</p><p>Careless Willie</p><p>Willie with a thirst for gore <br>Nailed his sister to the door <br>Mother said with humor quaint <br>"Careful, Willie, don't scratch the paint!"</p><p>Kennedy deserves credit for recognizing William Hughes Mearns with his famous four lines often supposed to be anonymous:</p><p>The Little Man <br>Who Wasn't There</p><p>As I was going up the stair <br>I met a man who wasn't there <br>He wasn't there again today <br>I wish, I wish he'd stay away.</p><p>The book charmingly includes the Lord's Prayer along with Lewis Carroll's "The Crocodile," a parody that has outlived its original, moralistic target:</p><p>How doth the little crocodile <br>Improve his shining tail, <br>And pour the waters of the Nile <br>On every golden scale!<br>How cheerfully he seems to grin, <br>How neatly spreads his claws, <br>And welcomes little fishes in, <br>With gently smiling jaws!</p><p>Reading such poems next to more ambitious work by Blake and Dickinson illuminates both kinds by making clear the element of song in the great poems and the element of meaning in the nonsense. This book is a gift for the adults who read it to or with children, as well as for the children. That fact is epitomized by the decision to close with Wallace Stevens's great, quiet poem "The House Was Quiet and the World Was Calm." "The quiet was part of the meaning," writes Stevens, "part of the mind." The quiet, impish, commanding voice of poetry can be heard in this selection of poems "for" children but -- happily -- not only for children.</p><p>By Robert Pinsky <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post.

Here are their stories: wilderness mothers, schoolmarms, Indian squaws, immigrants, homesteaders, and circuit riders. Their personal recollections of prairie fires, locust plagues, cowboy shootouts, Indian raids, and blizzards on the plains vividly reveal the drama, danger and excitement of the pioneer experience.<br> <br>These were women of relentless determination, whose tenacity helped them to conquer loneliness and privation. Their work was the work of survival, it demanded as much from them as from their men&#x2014;and at last that partnership has been recognized. &#x201c;These voices are haunting&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times Book Review),</i> and they reveal the special heroism and industriousness of pioneer women as never before.</p><p><b>Joanna L. Stratton</b> was born and raised in Washington, DC, but considers Kansas and her family there as her second home. She began her work on <i>Pioneer Women</i> while attending Harvard College, from which she graduated with honors in 1976. She is currently pursuing graduate studies at Stanford University.<b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br><br><b><i>To the Stars Through the Wilderness</i><br><br>The Journey</b><br><br><i>"Pioneering is really a wilderness experience. We all need the wisdom of the wilderness -- Moses did, Jesus did, and Paul did. The wilderness is the place to find God, and the city is the place to study the multitude; a knowledge of both makes master builders for the state and nation."</i><br><br>Lulu Fuhr<br><br>They called it "the Great American Desert." In the eyes of early explorers, Kansas appeared to be little more than an arid wasteland, unfit for cultivation and unsuitable for habitation. As a result, the Kansas wilderness remained relatively unknown until the middle of the nineteenth century. Originally a part of the Louisiana Purchase, it had been strictly maintained by the government as an Indian territory and as such was officially closed to any white settlement. Only a trickle of missionaries, soldiers, and surveyors were allowed to penetrate this barren, unfamiliar landscape.<br><br>But by 1850 an ever-increasing population and a growing economy focused attention on the country's need for new land. Expansive and promising, the Great Plains seemed to answer the call of a nation, and in May 1854 Congress, after considerable debate, passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act. With Kansas and Nebraska now open to settlement, a homesteading fever swept across the country. In Kansas alone, there were nearly fifty million acres of virgin grassland for the taking. People of all backgrounds and nationalities, rich or poor, were entitled to stake their claims and own a share of these untried plains.<br><br>Within months, settlers from the East, the South, the Midwest and even foreign countries streamed into the prairie heartland. Excited by the cheap land and the new opportunities to be found there, they bravely said goodbye to friends and family and abandoned every routine and comfort of their old lives.<br><br>"How our friends crowded around us at parting," wrote Lillie Marcks about her family's departure from Tiffin, Ohio, in May 1869. "Some cried and talked of Indians and bears. I was seven years old, had been staying with friends in Tiffin three weeks and they felt so badly about my going west and had me so beautifully dressed that even my father and mother scarcely knew me....<br><br>"I recall my mother's headaches on the trip, and many children dirty and cross, and how we longed for the journey's end."<br><br>Like thousands of other women, Melora Espy gave up the security of family ties and old friendships for the promise of a new life in Kansas. "In the year 1853," wrote her biographer, "a young girl of seventeen, even then the Principal of a Young Ladies School in Toledo, Ohio, joined her fortunes with those of her lover, Henry Jefferson Espy, a young lawyer of Sandusky, Ohio; resigned her position as teacher, and went over the Long Trail to become one of the pioneer women of Kansas. To leave permanently one's home and friends, parents, brothers and sisters; to journey a thousand miles, part of the way in an ox wagon, part of the way in a steamboat of the early time, to a strange land inhabited by savages, requires the greatest courage. To forsake culture, plenty, prosperity and peace, for crude living, poverty, adversity and war, requires a poise of soul few possess."<br><br>Despite the anguish of parting and the tedium of the long journey west, pioneers continued to emigrate by covered wagon, horseback, stagecoach, steamboat, railroad, and even by foot. For many pioneers the water routes proved to be particularly convenient. After journeying to the nearest departure points along the Ohio or Mississippi River, they boarded steamboats that churned up the Missouri to Kansas. The boats were crowded, the progress was slow and the trip was tedious, but the steamboat remained the most comfortable means of travel, avoiding the jolting passage of the plodding wagons and stages.<br><br>As migration increased, the stagecoach became more popular. "The old stagecoach," recalled one passenger, "was built along the lines you so often see now in frontier pictures -- two wide seats inside facing each other and a driver's seat high up on the outside front of the vehicle. The baggage was carried on racks at the back and on top. The bottom of the coach was rounded and hung on springs that caused it to rock back and forth in a swaying motion. It was drawn by four horses which were changed every twelve or fifteen miles at stations along the way."<br><br>The stagecoach was particularly convenient for the woman emigrant, alone or with children, who followed friends and family westward. However, the trip often proved to be a grueling journey over rough and rutted roads.<br><br>In 1867, Carrie Stearns Smith traveled by stagecoach from Kansas City, Missouri, to her new home south of Fort Scott. It was a tiring journey, but also one of adventure and spectacle.<br><br>"The stage station," she wrote, "was at a hotel I seem to recall as The Pacific....The stage swung around a corner with a great circling sweep of eight white horses, accoutered in all of harness and ornaments that could catch the sun and the eye. I have often been quizzed as to this statement of eight horses, but I cannot be mistaken; eight seems a superfluity but <i>there were eight.</i> It might have been an extra span was being driven to some station below to anticipate a future need of relays. The stage was a Vermont Sanderson, said to be the pioneer stage from coast to coast.<br><br>"At last we were all listed and crowded in -- wedged would better express the arrangement. The driver cracked his whip and away dashed the beautiful horses. I had been placed by the station agent in the care of a passenger they accosted as Governor Crawford, a slight invalid-appearing man, wearing a shawl, a fashion not then quite out of vogue. It occurred to me it would have been more appropriate to place the delicate traveler in my care, for he surely appeared the more likely of us two to succumb to the effects of rapid stage travel.<br><br>"Our route led south over Westport Road to our first mail station at Westport House, where with a great flourish and clatter of hoofs, we drew up alongside and an exchange of mail bags occurred. Then ho for Shawnee Mission, where at one of the huge original buildings, like formalities were observed. The dashing up and the dashing away from these stations was worthy of a king's retinue, an event that drew small crowds from the immediate vicinity.<br><br>"Our route was by no means the shortest distance between more important settlements. We diverged to the southeast and southwest here and there for the delivery of mail or the more practicable fording of streams. Whenever we halted for relays of horses, the traces were loosened, and the released spans marched unled to their long low shed barns, and those to be driven marched each to his accustomed place in front of the stage -- not an animal led or driven. Two or three minutes only were consumed in the exchange....<br><br>"We reached Paola just at dusk. The hotel was a rude rambling one-story affair, and soon after supper, when fairly abed and about to fall asleep, the sounds of fiddles in the dining-room told that a country dance was beginning. All the sleeping rooms seemed to open out of the dining-room. I occupied one with a lady on her way east to Pleasant Hill. Though very tired, the fiddles, the stamping of stoutly shod feet on the rough floor, and perhaps the excitement attendant on new experiences, kept me awake until 3 A.M., and it seemed I had only caught the merest wink of sleep after dancing ceased, when loud knocking at our door and 'stage leaving!' aroused me.<br><br>"I had always been able to dress with real speed, but when I reached the stage at the door, the agent gasped, 'Why, every seat is taken!' And no one of the several men inside offered a solution of the problem. So as I lifted mine eyes to the driver's seat, I managed to beg 'Could I sit with the driver?' The agent put the petition to the one aloft. 'Why, sure,' and I was pulled and hoisted to the seat. I secretly rejoiced. The previous day the presence of a sick child in the stage, poorly cared for by evidently very poor mountain people from Tennessee, had made the journey perforce most disagreeable because of the odor and flies.<br><br>"Away we dashed, I Fairly holding my breath and the railing at the end of my seat. But the sensation of swift motion and aloftness, the keen air of the October morning's dawn, the unusualness and the unexpectedness of that phase of my journey -- it was intoxicating!...<br><br>"At one point we had forded a stream with a border of brush, and rounding a hill across the ford he [the driver] pointed to a small new grave. Such a sadness possessed me, as I pictured to myself the delay in camp, the suffering of the little one, the absence of medical skill, the death, the burial, and the grief of leaving that freshly heaped mound. But hundreds of such mounds have marked the advance of pioneers. And what stories of grief do they suggest to those travelers who have passed that way."<br><br>Later that day, when the Sanderson stagecoach arrived at Fort Scott, Carrie Stearns Smith climbed down from her scenic seat in order to change to another, southbound coach. There was a disappointing delay of a day and a half before an "oilcloth-covered Democrat stage" pulled in for her at four o'clock in the morning.<br><br>"I was helped inside and in the darkness we rattled out of the 'Fort,' my only company a roll of freshly tanned leather, the size of a big person's body, placed diagonally across the seats.<br><br>"On we clattered, finally crossing several miles of timber on Dry-wood Creek and at its farthest edge we drew up in the dawn to a log hotel, Here was breakfast. I was chilled by the early ride and asked the Dutch proprietress if I might go into the kitchen to warm. As I drew near the kitchen stove, the swarms of flies on the low ceiling flew down and back with bzz-zz-zz-zz! The housefrau came out with knives and forks from the table where an earlier stage's passengers had eaten, swung around the tea kettle lid and thrust the articles of tableware into the boiling water, hastily drying them on a cloth. 'Heavens!' was my mental ejaculation. 'And I bet on a penny she makes the coffee from that identical kettle.' She did; and I vowed to refrain from coffee, but I was so frozen I verily believe I should have broken that vow if three times that unwashed cutlery had been immersed in that kettle.<br><br>"The driver and I breakfasted alone and exchanged brief sentences. Excellent bread, no butter; but lifting the last slice revealed a big grown specimen of cimex lectolarius -- familiarly known as bedbug!...<br><br>"By now the sun was well up. I had made slight acquaintance with the driver, a man of 35 to 40, and I ventured: 'I find the leather unbearable. Cannot I sit in front?' He was quite agreeable. Now I found a different type of prairie, and passing and leaving the few settlers' shacks near Arcadia, we followed the old military road over a barren, treeless stretch of thirty or more miles. There were roving herds of cattle, here and there a bloated carcass. I inquired; 'Flies,' said Mr. Laconic, and further perseverance on my part drew out the details of how an animal, ill-conditioned, often became the victim of concentrated hordes of flies that should have more impartially divided their assiduous attentions among the herd, until the poor beast succumbed, and finally became the most conspicuous object in the landscape. It did not enthuse me at all, even though assured this was bound to become a great stock country.<br><br>"Much of the uninteresting stretch passed over that day was later opened up as a great mining region. At this time, however, coal had been found cropping out along creeks or draws in very small quantities, such spots being much favored by campers as furnishing fuel for the campfire where no wood was found.<br><br>"The Old Military Road claimed my unaffected interest. For years over this road military supplies had been freighted from Fort Leavenworth, Westport and Missouri points to Fort Worth, Texas, and other places to the southwest. Great herds of cattle and ponies were driven north over this trail. The freightage had been so heavy that for long stretches great cracks had been opened between wheel tracks and often so deep a man's walking stick could be thrust downward and not find bottom. One track had been abandoned, another used until impracticable, then a third, until in places as many as ten or twelve were in existence -- all equally worn. This trail is historic, and at one point at least in Crawford County, at Mulberry, where the state line and the public road coincide for a distance with the old trail, the Daughters of the Revolution have placed a tablet commemorating the Old Military Road.<br><br>"My driver, after a prolonged interval of silence, mused aloud: 'I suppose I will be hauling you back in about three weeks.' Heavens! 'hauling.' I had never heard the word except as to hauling logs to a mill by chains. Again I queried, delicately. 'Oh, I hauled two young women down to Baxter Springs last summer. They claimed they were going to stay -- settlers. But I notice I hauled them back again, over this very road.' My vocabulary was beginning to add new words unto itself."<br><br>In the 1860s, a new kind of "hauling" was becoming popular in Kansas: the Kansas Pacific Railroad. Both the Civil War and a growing frontier industry and agriculture had spurred the demand for a transcontinental railroad, and Congress complied, launching, in 1862, the concurrent construction of the Central Pacific eastward from Sacramento and the Union Pacific westward from Omaha. Authorized as a branch of the Union Pacific, the Kansas Pacific line was soon chartered to connect Kansas City and Denver, and by 1863 construction was under way. Advancing rapidly across the state, this system established regular passenger service between Kansas City and Lawrence as early as 1864 and had proceeded westward through Manhattan, Abilene, Salina and Ellsworth by 1867. Slicing straight through Hays and across miles of barren Indian country, the Kansas Pacific finally reached Denver by 1870.<br><br>It was in its first year of operation that Mrs. Henry Inman discovered that this spanking new means of transportation was not without its perils.<br><br>"In January, 1868, I left my home for Fort Harker, Kansas," she wrote. "In that day the facilities for traveling were not accompanied with the comforts of the present time, but all went fairly well until we reached East St. Louis. There was no bridge then over the Mississippi River, and at midnight I walked over the ice to a boat which took us to St. Louis proper. From there we journeyed on to Salina, Kansas, where our train was waiting to bear us on to Fort Harker, then the terminus of the Union Pacific Railroad.<br><br>"It was snowing slightly, but the storm increased, and although Secretary Coburn denounces the word 'blizzard,' with apologies to him I can substitute no other to express the conditions of the storm we rode into. I had seen picturesque ones in New England, but never where the snow seemed to come from every direction, up as well as down, and seventeen miles west of Salina we became snowbound. The drifts proved too much for our faithful engineer and his engine. So we were left on the open prairie to the mercies of the elements, with complete time for reflection and one entire side of our train buried in snow.<br><br>"One passenger car was all we boasted, and I often recall the personnel of that one. Railroad employees, land-seekers -- namely 'squatters' as they were then called -- furloughed soldiers returning to their respective posts and I, the only woman among them, with a child two years old.<br><br>"I often wish I had registered the name...</p><h2>American History Now (Critical Perspectives On The P)</h2><p>A new generation of scholars addresses the current themes and questions in interpreting American history.</p><p>Eric Foner is DeWitt Clinton Professor of History at Columbia University and the author of numerous works on American history.

Brief and approachable, it offers both a broad overview of the exegetical process and a step-by-step approach to studying the New Testament in depth, helping students and pastors understand the text and appropriate it responsibly. The book is chock-full of illustrations of New Testament texts where the method under discussion truly makes a difference.<br><br>"A wonderfully clear and accessible handbook for New Testament exegesis. Exegetically rigorous, theologically informed, and practically useful."--<b>Thomas R. Schreiner</b>, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>"Blomberg and Foutz Markley have written a wonderfully clear and accessible handbook for New Testament exegesis. The book covers the various steps of the exegetical process and gives sane and sage advice throughout. What makes the book especially illuminating and interesting are the many examples from the New Testament that illustrate the principles discussed. Professors and students will be grateful for a work that is exegetically rigorous, theologically informed, and practically useful."--<b>Thomas R. Schreiner</b>, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br>"The process of Greek exegesis, starting at textual criticism and moving all the way to contextualization, can prove a daunting task for students and ministry leaders alike. Blomberg's and Foutz Markley's handbook promises to be a helpful guide along the way. Clearly written, it emphasizes the specific skills necessary for exegesis and explores practical issues of New Testament interpretation. The consistent use of biblical texts to illustrate a particular skill or guideline is an especially compelling feature of the book.

Her <i>Poems 1962&#x2013;2012 </i>was hailed as "a major event in this country's literature" in the pages of <i>The New York Times</i>. Every new collection is at once a deepening and a revelation. <i>Faithful and Virtuous Night</i> is no exception.<br> You enter the world of this spellbinding book through one of its many dreamlike portals, and each time you enter it's the same place but it has been arranged differently. You were a woman. You were a man. This is a story of adventure, an encounter with the unknown, a knight's undaunted journey into the kingdom of death; this is a story of the world you've always known, that first primer where "on page three a dog appeared, on page five a ball" and every familiar facet has been made to shimmer like the contours of a dream, "the dog float[ing] into the sky to join the ball." <i>Faithful and Virtuous Night </i>tells a single story but the parts are mutable, the great sweep of its narrative mysterious and fateful, heartbreaking and charged with wonder.</p></p><p><b>Louise Gl�ck</b> is the author of more than a dozen books of poems (<i>Averno, A Village Life</i>) and essay collections (<i>American Originality</i>). Her many awards include the Pulitzer Prize for <i>The Wild Iris</i>, the National Book Award for Poetry for <i>Faithful and Virtuous Night</i> and the National Book Critics Circle Award for <i>The Triumph of Achilles</i>. She teaches at Yale University and lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<p>&#x201c;One reason Gl�ck has proved so central to American poetry, for five decades now, lies in her remarkable talent for recapturing wonder. For all her disabused austerity, she remains a great poet of renewal . . . What makes Gl�ck's latest collection, <i>Faithful and Virtuous Night</i>, so powerful is the inventiveness with which the poet responds not only to her own mortality, but to the entirely new vantage on the world that her predicament affords . . . Reading these poems, one feels that all the resources Gl�ck has developed up until now have been brought to bear, and yet, even more impressively, that she has demanded of herself new and surprising methods . . . This is what makes <i>Faithful and Virtuous Night</i> so moving: Even as she admits that our forms of knowledge, the stories with which we understand the world and ourselves, are contingent and flawed, Gl�ck suggests such stories are no less necessary or real. There's not a hint of easy consolation, much less any 'triumph of the human spirit' in this book. But neither does the abiding darkness entail despair . . . The high art and deep pleasure of <i>Faithful and Virtuous Night</i> derive from . . . moments of startling presence, when everyday facts turn magical, when disenchantment itself leads to renewed enchantment. It is a great good fortune to hold these poems in hand.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Peter Campion, The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;Shifting between prosaic passages and her more familiar lyric investigations of family, loss, and time's tide, Gl�ck's new collection of poems finds cinematic scope through a deeply personal lens. Moving and rich, her mastery of what she knows is matched only by her ease with the uncertain. 'A word drops into the mist,' she writes, 'like a child's ball into high grass.'&#x201d; &#x2015;Michael Andor Brodeur, <i>The Boston Globe</i></p><p>&#x201c;We go to Gl�ck, as to all great poets, for what Frost called a 'clarification of life,' but, like Frost, whom she resembles in no other way, Gl�ck wants the clarification without sacrificing the doubt. To do this, both poets make their revealed wisdom radically contingent upon circumstance. Nothing is final; certainty is an illusion. And so we find in Gl�ck's work, as in Frost's, the temptation to truth tempered by the awareness of context.&#x201d; &#x2015;Dan Chiasson, <i>The New Yorker</i></p><p>&#x201c;Louise Gl�ck just keeps getting better. One of our finest contemporary poets--as her collected poems showed two years ago--she has changed her aesthetic strategy over the years, moving away from adaptations of Greek and Roman myths toward a new oracular tone of her own. The result is brilliant and haunting, captivating and mysterious, but, as always, couched in spare, emotionally charged diction . . . In <i>Faithful and Virtuous Night</i>, her 13th collection, Gl�ck writes with a timeless quality, perched on the edge of expectation, awaiting a revelation through the mist, a signal in the capacious night. Her richness of thought and restrained, melancholy voice call forth the rhythms of the broken heart: beating valiantly in quiet desolation. She is the lost pilgrim, unsure whether the still, small pinnacle of her experience is a peak or plateau.&#x201d; &#x2015;Arlice Davenport, <i>Wichita Eagle</i></p></p><h2>On Fear</h2><p><p><em>On Fear</em> is a collection of Krishnamurti's most profound observations and thoughts on how fear and dependence affect our lives and prevent us from seeing our true selves. Among the many questions Krishnamurti addresses in these remarkable teachings are: How can a mind that is afraid love? And what can a mind that depends on attachment know of joy? He points out that the voice of fear makes the mind dull and insensitive, and argues that the roots of hidden fears, which limit us and from which we constantly seek escape, cannot be discovered through analysis of the past. Questioning whether the exercise of will can eliminate the debilitating effects of fear, he suggests, instead, that only a fundamental realization of the root of all fear can free our minds.</p></p><p><p>J. Krishnamurti (1895-1986) was a renowned spiritual teacher whose lectures and writings have inspired thousands. His works include <em>On Mind and Thought, On Nature and the Environment, On Relationship, On Living and Dying, On Love and Lonliness, On Fear,</em> and <em>On Freedom.</em></p></p><h2>The Adventures of Sir Lancelot the Great (The Knights&#39; Tales Series, 1)</h2><p>Many years ago, the storytellers say, the great King Arthur brought justice to England with the help of his gallant Knights of the Round Table. Of these worthy knights, there was never one so fearless, so chivalrous, so honorable, so...shiny as the dashing Sir Lancelot, who was quite good at defending the helpless and protecting the weak, just as long as he&#x2019;d had his afternoon nap. Behold the very exciting and very funny adventures of Lancelot the Great, as only acclaimed Arthurian author Gerald Morris can tell them.</p><p>When Gerald Morris was in fifth grade he loved Greek and Norse mythology and before long was retelling the stories to his younger sister and then to neighborhood kids. He began carrying a notebook in which he kept some of the details related to the different stories. The joy he found in retelling those myths continued when he discovered other stories. According to Gerald Morris, &#x201c;I never lost my love of retelling the old stories. When I found Arthurian literature, years later, I knew at once that I wanted to retell those grand tales. So I pulled out my notebook . . . I retell the tales, peopling them with characters that I at least find easier to recognize, and let the magic of the Arthurian tradition go where it will.&#x201d; Gerald Morris lives in Wausau, Wisconsin, with his wife and their three children. In addition to writing he serves as a minister in a church.Chapter 2 The Fastest Knight in England<br><br>In no time at all, the storytellers say, Sir Lancelot became the most famous of all King Arthur&#x2019;s knights in shining armor. No other knight rescued so many damsels in distress or slew so many dragons or overcame so many recreant knights or, for that matter, kept his armor so tidy. He performed so many great deeds that he soon became known as Sir Lancelot the Great. Minstrels sang songs of his adventures, damsels sighed when he passed by, boys playing knights all wanted to be Sir Lancelot, and young knights dreamed of one day defeating Sir Lancelot, because whoever did that, they thought, would be regarded as the greatest knight in England.<br>That last part soon got to be a problem. Everywhere Sir Lancelot went, knights were waiting to challenge him, all hoping to win fame and glory with one battle. Sir Lancelot defeated them all, but fighting every knight he met grew rather tiresome. So, when he rode out on a quest, he chose lonely paths. This was why he was riding alone through a quiet forest one day when he heard an unexpected sound.<br> WAAAAAH!&#x201d; It was a damsel in distress. When you ride out on enough quests, you get to know that sound. Sir Lancelot turned toward the wailing and soon came to a woman sitting alone beneath a great oak tree, crying with gusto.<br> Good day, my lady,&#x201d; Sir Lancelot said politely. It was hard to know the right thing to say at times like this.<br> WAAAAAH!&#x201d; the lady said. Sir Lancelot said, May I be of service, my lady?&#x201d; WOOOO-HOOOO-WAAH!&#x201d; Can you tell me what is distressing you, my lady?&#x201d; WAAAH! BLUH-BLUH-WOO-WAAH!&#x201d; I&#x2019;ll just wait here a bit, then, shall I?&#x201d; WIBBLE-BLIDDER-WO-WO-HAH-WAAH!&#x201d; So Sir Lancelot sat on his horse and waited. No one can cry forever, and when at last the lady had used up all her tears, Sir Lancelot asked again, Can you tell me what is distressing you?&#x201d; It&#x2019;s my . . . my fal-fal-falcon!&#x201d; the lady gasped.<br> Now in those days, noble lords and ladies used to train falcons to hunt for them. They kept them on leashes, then set them free to hunt small birds. A well-trained falcon that is, one that would come back was quite valuable.<br> What happened to your falcon, my lady?&#x201d; It flew away! It was a gift from my husband,&#x201d; the woman wailed, beginning to cry again. Not all falcons were well trained.<br> I&#x2019;m sorry to hear it, my lady,&#x201d; said Sir Lancelot. I wish I could help you.&#x201d; Would you?&#x201d; the woman exclaimed, her tears stopping at once.<br> Er . . . if I could,&#x201d; Sir Lancelot replied. But how? I can&#x2019;t chase a falcon through the sky.&#x201d; Oh, you don&#x2019;t have to chase her at all,&#x201d; the woman said, smiling brightly. She&#x2019;s right up there!&#x201d; The woman pointed up. There at the top of the oak tree was a falcon, her leash tangled in the small branches.<br> Oh,&#x201d; said Sir Lancelot.<br> You said you&#x2019;d help,&#x201d; the woman reminded him.<br> Er . . . yes, I did. The thing is, it&#x2019;s rather hard to climb trees in armor.&#x201d; Can&#x2019;t you take your armor off?&#x201d; the woman asked. She sniffled.<br> Sir Lancelot frowned. He had just had his armor shined and didn&#x2019;t like to leave it lying around. Then he sighed. Of course, my lady.&#x201d; Twenty minutes later, his armor and sword stacked neatly beside a bush, Sir Lancelot began climbing the tree. While he climbed, he wondered how to untangle an angry falcon from a tree without getting pecked, but soon he saw what to do. Coming to the branch where the bird was tangled, he simply broke it off at the base and tossed the whole branch free. Bird and branch fluttered and crashed to the ground, and Sir Lancelot wiped his brow with relief.<br></p><h2>The Clean House and Other Plays</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Passionate. Show-stopping.

This cannot be simply explained by economic factors, with poorer women lacking resources or access to care. Even professional, middle-class black women are at a much higher risk of premature birth than low-income white women in the United States. D�na-Ain Davis looks into this phenomenon, placing racial differences in birth outcomes into a historical context, revealing that ideas about reproduction and race today have been influenced by the legacy of ideas which developed during the era of slavery.<br><br>While poor and low-income black women are often the &#x201c;mascots&#x201d; of premature birth outcomes, this book focuses on professional black women, who are just as likely to give birth prematurely. Drawing on an impressive array of interviews with nearly fifty mothers, fathers, neonatologists, nurses, midwives, and reproductive justice advocates, D�na-Ain Davis argues that events leading up to an infant&#x2019;s arrival in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and the parents&#x2019; experiences while they are in the NICU, reveal subtle but pernicious forms of racism that confound the perceived class dynamics that are frequently understood to be a central factor of premature birth.<br><br>The book argues not only that medical racism persists and must be considered when examining adverse outcomes&#x2015;as well as upsetting experiences for parents&#x2015;but also that NICUs and life-saving technologies should not be the only strategies for improving the outcomes for black pregnant women and their babies. Davis makes the case for other avenues, such as community-based birthing projects, doulas, and midwives, that support women during pregnancy and labor are just as important and effective in avoiding premature births and mortality.</p></p><p><b>D�na-Ain Davis</b> is Director of the Center for the Study of Women and Society at the Graduate Center, CUNY (New York). She is the author of Battered Black Women and Welfare Reform: Between a Rock and Hard Place."<i>Reproductive Injustice </i>provides a powerful look at the disturbing and lingering disparity in premature births occurring among black women... Davis presents a deterritorialized ethnography that covers time and space: her fieldwork with mothers, birth workers, and hospital staff illuminates a rich narrative encompassing black women&#x2019;s reproduction, the history of the March of Dimes, and development of the neonatal intensive care unit. A must read for students of anthropology, sociology, and medicine, particularly practitioners working with pregnancy and childbirth."<br><br>"As a white NICU nurse, I came to read <i>Reproductive Injustice </i>because I suspected I was participating in medical racism, but had never learned the relevant history to identify how, or critical race theory to know what to do about it. Reading Dr. Davis&#x2019; work, it was devastatingly easy for me to see how current practices in my NICU workplace reflected racist ideologies born from American slavery. As the work repeatedly &#x2018;[reiterates] racism&#x2019;s grammar,&#x2019; <i>Reproductive Injustice </i> gave me the vocabulary to begin to challenge it." (<i>Words of Choice</i>)<br><br>"Davis explores how medical racism impacts black women... The work is unique in that it is the first to focus on the subject as it relates to professional working women and provides evidence that black women across all classes still have a higher rate of premature births than other women."</p><h2>Shooting to Kill: How an Independent Producer Blasts Through the Barriers to Make Movies that Matter</h2><p>Complete with behind-the-scenes diary entries from the set of Vachon's best-known fillms, Shooting to Kill offers all the satisfaction of an intimate memoir from the frontlines of independent filmmakins, from one of its most successful agent provocateurs - and survivors. Hailed by the New York Times as the "godmother to the politically committed film" and by Interview as a true "auteur producer," Christine Vachon has made her name with such bold, controversial, and commercially successful films as "Poison," "Swoon," Kids," "Safe," "I Shot Andy Warhol," and "Velvet Goldmine."Over the last decade, she has become a driving force behind the most daring and strikingly original independent filmmakers-from Todd Haynes to Tom Kalin and Mary Harron-and helped put them on the map.<p>So what do producers do? "What don't they do? " she responds. In this savagely witty and straight-shooting guide, Vachon reveals trheguts of the filmmaking process-rom developing a script, nurturing a director's vision, getting financed, and drafting talent to holding hands, stoking egos, stretching every resource to the limit and pushing that limit. Along the way, she offers shrewd practical insights and troubleshooting tips on handling everything from hysterical actors and disgruntled teamsters to obtuse marketing executives.</p><p>Complete with behind-the-scenes diary entries from the sets of Vachon's best-known films, Shooting To Kill offers all the satisfactions of an intimate memoir from the frontlines of independent filmmaking, from one of its most successful agent provocateurs-and survivors.</p><p></p></p><p>Christine Vachon has emerged over the last ten years as one of the key leaders of the New York independent film movement. She lives in New York City, where she heads her own company, Killer Films.Labeled the "godmother to the politically committed film" by the New York Times, producer Vachon, head of NYC's Killer Films, emerged as one of the key players in the current independent film movement with such movies as Kids, Safe, Go Fish, I Shot Andy Warhol and Velvet Goldmine, scheduled by Miramax for November. For this guided tour through the world of low-budget independent filmmaking, Vachon teamed with Slate film critic Edelstein to "tell you what producers do and how you can do it too." With 15 years of experience, she's writing about what she knows?the full filmmaking process from the pitch and story rights to script development and financing through casting, costs, crews, computer schedules and storyboards, scouting locations and constructing sets, editing and postproduction, deals and distribution, film fests and marketing. Covering all aspects, she outlines factors that make "the difference between a dream shoot and a campfire-ready tale of terror." This is no dry textbook, since even chapters crammed with facts and information communicate a kinetic enthusiasm. Diary excerpts and 50 b&amp;w photos punctuate the blitz on budgets and breakdowns, and other industry pros toss in short sidebar observations. Entertaining, emotional anecdotes abound, contrasting negotiation nightmares with Vachon's desire to protect her directors, actors and associates. Although the prose style's jump-cut jumble might leave some yearning for a more conventional chronological structure, Vachon reaches readers on such a level of intimate intensity it's evident that her future books will be green-lighted. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>You Can&#39;t Send a Duck to Eagle School</h2><p>You Can&#39;t Send a Duck to Eagle School is a must-have guide for every leader!

The diary vividly records Gould&#x2019;s activity as part of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron off the coast of North Carolina and Virginia; his visits to New York and Boston; the pursuit to Nova Scotia of a hijacked Confederate cruiser; and service in European waters pursuing Confederate ships constructed in Great Britain and France. Gould&#x2019;s diary is one of only three known diaries of African American sailors in the Civil War. It is distinguished not only by its details and eloquent tone (often deliberately understated and sardonic), but also by its reflections on war, on race, on race relations in the Navy, and on what African Americans might expect after the war. The book includes introductory chapters that establish the context of the diary narrative, an annotated version of the diary, a brief account of Gould&#x2019;s life in Massachusetts after the war, and William B. Gould IV&#x2019;s thoughts about the legacy of his great-grandfather and his own journey of discovery in learning about this remarkable man.</p><p>&#x201c;[Diary of a Contraband provides] modern readers with vivid insight into the life and thought of a man who overcame the degradations of slavery, actively sought his own freedom and fought to make it permanent, and in the end forged a new life as a full citizen . . . .An unusual work, [it is] one of only three wartime diaries kept by black sailors.&#x201d;&#x2014;Library Journal<br>&#x201c;Diary of a Contraband offers a fascinating picture of everyday life for sailors and cilivians in the 1860s.

It has been our pleasure and duty to bear witness to couples' commitment to one another, their faces shining with joy and love, before the gods and their community. However, the days or months leading up to that point had often been fraught with a good deal of trial and tribulation for Neopagan couples who wanted to write their own ceremonies and had very little to choose from. There were certainly a number of handfasting rituals in the books of the Neopagan "old masters," and many of those had some truly beautiful lines, but they generally tended toward the same format. We found that the needs of modern Neopagan couples were too varied to resort to one-size-fits-all wedding ceremonies. Some were deep in the broom closet and wanted a nondenominational" ritual that had Pagan overtones but could pass in front of intolerant non-Pagan family members. Some wanted it openly Pagan, but light-a ceremony that reasonably tolerant non-Pagan guests would find inoffensive and not uncomfortable. Others wanted it Pagan all the way, but with a theme other than the "traditional" format- combining it with semihistorical aesthetics, Tolkien elves, Native American words, science fiction, fantasy faeries, or any number of other interesting ideas. <br> <br>In some cases, one partner was Pagan and the other practiced a different religion that they wanted incorporated into the ritual. These couples usually felt that it would be easier to incorporate Jewish or Christian imagery into a ceremony performed by a Pagan clergyperson than to attempt to push Pagan ritual into a more conservative church or temple structure, and they needed inspiration. <br> <br>Then there was the problem of nontraditional marriages. Although queer weddings are certainly not disallowed in our faith, there was little attempt to create ceremonies for nonheterosexual couples (one exception to the former was Z. Budapest's lesbian wedding tryst in The Holy Book of Women's Mysteries), and none at all for polyamorous group-weddings. <br> <br>We've found quite a few books on the market that contained build-your-own wedding materials-pieces of texts and invocations-but they were all geared toward a Judeo-Christian world. It can feel unsatisfying for many couples to simply change "God" to "Goddess" half the time, and go from there. We have had couples turn to us confused and frustrated when they were told they would, in essence, have &nbsp;to choose from a few similarly formatted rituals or create their own from scratch. "I asked the High Priestess who was going to perform our ceremony if there was a reference book we could buy on the subject, and she laughed!" was one dejected groom-to-be's comment. <br> <br>Handfasting and Wedding Rituals is that reference book. Even with all the rituals -whole and in pieces-that you'll find in here, nothing may suit you exactly. That's all right. Feel free to mix and match, pull out a vow here or a circle casting there. Maybe only a few lines may inspire you, but if they spark you to write the words that you really need, then this book has done its job. <br> <br>You will find all the rituals and ritual segments in this book labeled with level 1, level 2, or level 3. This denotes the level of obvious Pagan content. A level 1 ritual can be performed in front of non-Pagans to whom you do not wish to explain your religion. These rituals are a way to incorporate subtle Pagan aesthetics into your wedding and still be "stealth," if that is what you require. No deity names are invoked in these rituals, and they can be passed off as fantasy or folk tradition. Level 2 rituals are "Pagan Lite"; they may invoke deities, but they do not require the guests to have any knowledge of Paganism, and they don't contain activities that might upset most non- Pagans. Level 3 rituals are for the hardcore Pagan couple who are not concerned with the shockability of their audience. Deities are invoked repeatedly, in all their glory, and no attempt is made to lighten the tone. <br> <br><b>getting started <br></b>Have your ceremony planned out as far ahead as possible. You, your clergyperson, and the participants may find it much less stressful to have copies of it months ahead of the wedding date so as to be familiar with it when the time comes. When Raven and Bella married, their complex ritual was put on paper literally two days before the wedding date, and poor Tannin, who was marrying them, only got handed the final copy an hour beforehand, and she stumbled through the complicated wording as best she could. Be kind to the people who are helping you make this day special, and give them plenty of time to get familiar with it and not make fools of themselves-or you. <br> <br>You will also want to think about how long you actually want your rite to be. Once you've decided on the wording and plan of action, do a walk-through with people reading the parts and making the motions (this doesn't have to be the actual people who are in the ceremony; you can find friends for stand-ins) and see how long it takes. Take note of how your vows sound. The vows that seemed perfect on the page may be wrong or awkward when read aloud. Remember that juggling props like chalices and knives and scrolls and cords takes more time than you might think, and candles can suddenly refuse to light. Don't keep people standing in a circle for longer than half an hour, and provide chairs for the elderly or disabled and those with small children. Don't rush through it, either; slow is better. People are actually going to want to hear what's going on. With this in mind, if it reads as an hour in a simple rehearsal, it's going to be an hour and a half in real time, and you might want to shorten it. <br> <br>We've found, by trial and error as Neopagan clergypeople, that anything under twenty minutes feels too short for people who may have come a long way to watch a ritual happen, and anything over an hour and a half can be too long for an audience to remain focused. Also, the more people present, the shorter the ceremony should be. (We've found that the more people in a crowd, the shorter the attention span of everyone in it.) Use the above time guideline for a crowd of fifty onlookers, and subtract a minute for each additional person until you get down to an hour, and then subtract a minute for each two additional people. If you have a really big crowd, keep it at about half an hour. If it's an elaborate ceremony, practice with props and restrictive costumes in advance. Don't overschedule things to do; for instance, one couple wanted to plant a tree as part of their ceremony, but someone pointed out to them that they would both be clad in flowing silks and probably didn't want to go digging holes and shoveling dirt in their expensive and fragile outfits. <br> <br>Rehearsal also helps with estimating space. Sitting people take up more room than standing people but are less comfortable. Any kind of dancing, musicians, or even ritual walking about or gesticulating requires room. If you are going to use friends to call the quarters, make sure that they have four clear spaces to move to without pushing people aside. Also, make sure the props are appropriate for their users. We know of one very small priestess who was asked by the groom to cast a circle with his five-foot claymore, which she found in midritual was too heavy for her to lift and dangerously sharp, as well. She had to draft a helper to hold the tip up and walk around her in a circle while she staggered under the weight of the hilt. <br> <br>You may also want think about the problem of volume. If there will be two hundred people present in an outdoor area, will everyone be able to hear you? If they can all hear you, will it be so loud that it disturbs the neighbors? In this day and age of portable sound equipment, it's easy to miscalculate the noise level, and, onversely, unamplified voices are not as loud and distinct in the open air as you think. <br> <br>The religions of relatives are often a touchy subject in Pagan handfastings, especially legal ones. We strongly warn against using your wedding as your coming-outof-the-broom-closet statement. It's akin to inviting your parents to a drag show you are starring in as your way of telling them that you're gay. It's far more respectful, and safer, to talk to them about it beforehand. One bride, the daughter of fundamentalist parents, sent them a very Pagan-oriented invitation, and then explained the situation over the phone. She said, "If you're not comfortable with this, I respect that, and I'll understand if you can't make it. If there's something that I can do to make you more comfortable, tell me, and I'll decide if it's workable." <br> <br>Respect aside, you should never assume that the public nature of a wedding will keep people on their best behavior. We've seen terrible outbursts at weddings from disgruntled relatives. It's better to make sure that everyone knows everything beforehand and that there are no surprises. This also goes for relations who are currentlyfeuding. If you just can't bring yourself to talk to your family about your religion (or any potentially explosive family situation), then maybe you should either talk to a therapist about it or else not invite them. Some people actually hold two weddings, a secular one and a spiritual one, or they hold weddings with different guests, in order to make everyone comfortable. <br> <br>For that matter, if any of your guests may be uncomfortable with any part of your ceremony, let them know about any unusual activities on the invitation. If you're expecting people to participate in something (more actively than watching, anyway), let them know this as well. It's best not to surprise anyone with a ritual role on the day of the wedding; let them know well beforehand. And even if you have designed your ceremony for the maximum number of active participants, please make room for guests who are shy, uncomfortable, or don't feel well and only want to watch. <br> <br>And speaking of respect, it's important also to respect the venue. Don't hold your handfasting on a site where you don't have permission to be. Even if it's a "deserted" space such as a quarry or overgrown lot, someone may own it. Public areas usually require permits of some sort; this includes cemeteries, parks, and the town green. It's a bad omen to have the police break up your handfasting. On the other hand, forewarned police officers (or forest rangers, etc.) can be allies in keeping interlopers out of your space, or reassuring neighbors that this is "only a wedding." <br> <br>If you do get permission, make sure you understand the regulations set by the owners, and be prepared to follow them to the letter. Do not bring items to the ceremony that are illegal in certain public areas. Things like fire (including tobacco and incense), weapons (edged or otherwise), animals, video or flash cameras, alcohol, bloodletting, and food and beverages can all be illegal in public places. Certain types of entertainment may also be questionable, such as "fortunetellers," which includes any kind of diviner, since in some towns these activities are illegal under panhandling laws. When in doubt, check with the local authorities. If you must have these things at your ceremony, make arrangements with the owner of a private site. It's better to pay a little extra money than to be publicly humiliated. <br> <br>Plan to bring a cleanup crew, and leave your site clean. In times of ecstatic celebration, it's easy to forget the rules of common courtesy. Plan for that cleanup period, even if it only consists of a site check. You might try designating one friend (preferably someone willing to stay sober) who will do a litter and lost-and-found patrol after the guests have left. <br> <br>The "wonderful wedding experience" usually doesn't come about without a whole lot of careful planning. There are books available on general wedding etiquette, catering, reception issues, and so forth; we've touched on only those problems that are particular to Pagan handfastings. However, despite all the complexities of preparation and arrangements, the united efforts of the couple, the clergyperson, and assorted friends and family can result in the most wondrous and inspiring memory of a couple's lifetogether. That's why we keep on performing them, time after time. <br> <br></p><h2>Zachary Taylor: The American Presidents Series: The 12th President, 1849-1850</h2><p><p><b>The rough-hewn general who rose to the nation's highest office, and whose presidency witnessed the first political skirmishes that would lead to the Civil War</b></p><p>Zachary Taylor was a soldier's soldier, a man who lived up to his nickname, "Old Rough and Ready." Having risen through the ranks of the U.S. Army, he achieved his greatest success in the Mexican War, propelling him to the nation's highest office in the election of 1848. He was the first man to have been elected president without having held a lower political office.</p><p>John S. D. Eisenhower, the son of another soldier-president, shows how Taylor rose to the presidency, where he confronted the most contentious political issue of his age: slavery. The political storm reached a crescendo in 1849, when California, newly populated after the Gold Rush, applied for statehood with an anti- slavery constitution, an event that upset the delicate balance of slave and free states and pushed both sides to the brink. As the acrimonious debate intensified, Taylor stood his ground in favor of California's admission&#x2015;despite being a slaveholder himself&#x2015;but in July 1850 he unexpectedly took ill, and within a week he was dead. His truncated presidency had exposed the fateful rift that would soon tear the country apart.</p></p><p><b>John S. D. Eisenhower</b> was a retired brigadier general, a former U.S. ambassador to Belgium, and the author of numerous works of military history and biography, including <i>General Ike: A Personal Reminiscence</i>; <i>They Fought at Anzio</i>; <i>Yanks: The Epic Story of the American Army in World War I</i>; and <i>So Far from God: The U.S. War with Mexico, 1846&#x2013;1848</i>.<p>Chapter One Early Career Zachary Taylor was a man whose looks deceived those who met him for the first time. One glance at that rough physiognomy could convince the casual viewer that here was a son of a poor family, a man of the soil. The fact was that Zack Taylor&#x2014;Old Rough and Ready&#x2014;was indeed a farmer, but a gentleman farmer. Throughout his life, even when he was in the army, he kept ownership of several plantations, tilled by numerous slaves. His face was weather-beaten, to be sure, but his exposure to the elements came from his time in camp and field, a place where he endured the same hardships as the youngest and toughest of his soldiers. Taylor was born on November 24, 1784, in Orange County,Virginia, not far from Montpelier, the home of his distant cousin the future president James Madison. His father, Richard Taylor, had served as an officer in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War and enjoyed the status of being the head of one of the prominent families of Virginia.The Taylors never reached the eminence enjoyed by the Lees and the Carters, but they were a family of respect. Richard Taylor&#x2019;s outstanding service in the Revolution ironically resulted in Zachary Taylor&#x2019;s leaving Virginia and becoming a Kentuckian. A grateful nation, still governed under the Articles of Confederation, granted Richard Taylor a large parcel of land at a point near Louisville, Kentucky. Richard Taylor accepted, presumably with enthusiasm. The land that comprised his extensive holdings in Tidewater Virginia was beginning to wear out from excessive tobacco raising. Further, they could never compare in size and quality with the land he was being offered in the West. Having determined to move, Richard Taylor began the journey with his pregnant wife, the former Sarah Dabney Strother of Maryland. They soon realized, however, that the journey would be too arduous for her. He therefore left her and their two sons with relatives in Virginia while he headed west alone. He returned seven months later, having cleared some ground near his future homestead. Zachary Taylor, meanwhile, had been born in Virginia. But since he spent only his first eight months there, he could hardly be called a Virginian in the traditional sense. The Taylors made their way to Kentucky by water, reaching Louisville on August 2, 1785. They settled in their log cabin on Beargrass Creek, five miles to the east of town, on a four-hundred acre farm they called Springfield. There Zachary, his two older brothers, and yet unborn siblings were to be raised.1 Louisville, on the wild frontier, bore no resemblance to the genteel Tidewater district the Taylors had left. Wild animals filled the woods surrounding Springfield, and wild Indians in the vicinity had not accommodated themselves to the invasion of the white man. As a result, young Zachary grew up in an atmosphere where danger was accepted. Sometimes it had its humorous side. A nearby neighbor, Mrs. Chenoweth, seemed to derive some strange pleasure in startling the young people by removing her headgear and displaying her bald head, which was described as "peeled like an onion by the Indians&#x2019; scalping knife," and "shorn of her beautiful hair."2 So the story went, though the circumstance of her being scalped is not disclosed. Zachary Taylor&#x2019;s formal education was scanty, despite the fact that both of his parents were considered upper class. He learned to read and write, of course, like many other isolated children, at "his mother&#x2019;s knee." His first extant letter, in which he accepted a commission in the United States Army, was rough and full of misspellings. But given the circumstances of the frontier, his training in farming and taking care of himself was far more important than book learning. He was also, like his father, a shrewd businessman and competent farmer. Throughout his life his properties continued to grow, and his conversation, even in camp, often dealt with agricultural subjects. He was able to accomplish this balancing act because of the peculiar nature of the army at that time. The establishment was scattered in small detachments along the western frontier and except for occasional Indian disturbances was at peace.The authorities, therefore, were generous in granting long leaves of absence whereby an officer could return to his ranch or farm for extended periods of time. Land was wealth, and during his lifetime Zachary Taylor, measured by that standard, became a wealthy man indeed. Though he was a planter, Zachary Taylor was first and foremost a soldier. The aura of his father&#x2019;s service in the Revolution apparently caught his imagination, and his participation in the various skirmishes with the Indians, while largely unrecorded, seems to have imbued him with a fighting spirit. He was not attracted to fancy uniforms nor to the parade ground, but practical soldiering seems to have become second nature to him. The personal informality was misleading, however; beneath his casual exterior, he was a martinet. He first joined the army in 1808, at the age of twenty-three, when he applied for and received a commission as a first lieutenant. Taylor was fortunate; normally a young man lacking in formal military experience could never enter service at that rank. It was a troubled time, and the army was being expanded in anticipation of possible war with Britain over the <em>Chesapeake-Leopard</em> Affair, in which the crew of a British ship, the HMS <em>Leopard</em>, had forcibly boarded the United States ship USS <em>Chesapeake</em>, killing three, wounding eighteen, and removing several sailors of British birth. Though President Thomas Jefferson did not resort to war, the tensions and talk of war remained. On being commissioned, Taylor was assigned to the new Seventh Infantry Regiment, just being organized. It was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel William Russell, another Kentuckian. The regiment at the moment existed only on paper; to fill its ranks the men had to be recruited. So Taylor began his career as a recruiting officer. He was sent first to Washington, Kentucky, where he found little enthusiasm on the part of the citizenry for military life. He went on to Mayville, where he had better luck.3 In April 1809, he took his new company of about eighty men by boat from Kentucky to New Orleans. The situation at New Orleans was hardly conducive to inspiring a young man to remain in military life. The troops were suffering in the heat of the New Orleans summer, and to make matters worse they were commanded by a rogue, Brigadier General James Wilkinson. At a time when rogues abounded, Wilkinson was unique in the varieties of his villainy. Some officers were treacherous, some were avaricious, and some were simply incompetent. Wilkinson managed to combine all three. Perhaps the least of his flaws was his greed. "One of the more senior officers in the Army," writes the historian Edward Coffman, "set an extraordinarily bad example. In the range of his ventures&#x2014;land speculation, assorted business enterprises, including some of dubious legality, and being a paid agent of Spain&#x2014;General Wilkinson took second place to none."4 At about the time of Taylor&#x2019;s arrival at New Orleans,Wilkinson was about to embark on the project for which he is most infamous. At that time, the bulk of the army, about two thousand men, was concentrated under his command, and the condition of the troops was grim. They suffered from the heat and indulged in the fleshly temptations of the city to the extent that everyone, even Wilkinson, agreed that they had to be moved. Secretary of War Henry Dearborn therefore ordered Wilkinson to move his army up the Mississippi River to Fort Adams, near Natchez, where conditions were said to be relatively healthy. Wilkinson may not have received this order in time because communications were slow. In any case he moved, not to Natchez but to a spot below New Orleans on the Mississippi only thirteen miles away from the city. (It has been assumed that his business interests, plus the allurements of his current mistress, were instrumental in his choice.) The name of the spot was Terre Aux Boeufs, and a worse place could not be found. As aptly described by Taylor&#x2019;s biographer, Holman Hamilton, Here the general stood by helpless as his troops suffered, sickened, and died. The Kentuckians, who composed the Seventh Infantry and who had undergone the coldest winter in memory, succumbed even faster than their comrades. Conditions at camp beggared description. More men were sick than well, and it was impossible to care for all their needs. Sanitation did not exist. Spoiled food, supplied by seedy and frequently corrupt contractors, revolted those who were supposed to eat it. Attempts at burial were pitiful. Interred higgledy-piggledy in shallow graves, the protruding arms and legs of the deceased took the place of missing markers in reminding the living of the fate that might be theirs.5 The story did not end there. When orders finally arrived insisting that Wilkinson&#x2019;s troops be moved to Natchez, the trip by water, involving weakened men, was as deadly as the camp. Nearly the entire army was wiped out. It was one of those rare instances in which an army was destroyed without the .ring of a single bullet. Taylor himself was spared most of the trials of the Terre Aux Boeufs calamity because he succumbed to the prevailing illness early but survived it. He was sent home to Louisville to recover while Wilkinson&#x2019;s army was being rebuilt at Natchez. He took his time back at Louisville in getting his personal holdings in order. While on this extended leave at Louisville, Zachary Taylor met his future wife, Margaret Mackall Smith, who was visiting her sister, Mrs. Samuel Chew, in nearby Jefferson County. The couple secured their marriage license on June 18, 1810, and three days later were married. In honor of the occasion, Taylor&#x2019;s father presented the couple with 324 acres of land. In the spring of the next year, their first daughter, Ann, was born.6 When he returned to duty, Taylor found himself in an entirely different situation from that at New Orleans. The immediate crisis with Britain had passed, and the bulk of the...</p></p><h2>Antelope Woman: A Novel</h2><p><p>This updated edition of National Book Award-winning and <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Louise Erdrich&#x2019;s 1998 novel now features fascinating new content, a new title, new cover art, and a new foreword by the author&#x2014;a riveting story that explores tensions between Native American and white cultures. </p><p><strong>&#x201c;Audacious and surprising...

Indeed, the faithful often view converting others as an obligation of their faith--and are trained from an early age to spread their unique brand of religion. The result is a world broken in large part by unquestioned faith. As an urgently needed counter to this tried-and-true tradition of religious evangelism, <i>A Manual for Creating Atheists</i> offers the first-ever guide not for talking people into faith--but for talking them out of it. Peter Boghossian draws on the tools he has developed and used for more than twenty years as a philosopher and educator to teach how to engage the faithful in conversations that will help them value reason and rationality, cast doubt on their religious beliefs, mistrust their faith, abandon superstition and irrationality, and ultimately embrace reason.</p><p>"If I started reading A Manual for Creating Atheists as a&nbsp;Christian I would have been an atheist by the time I finished it.&nbsp;Peter Boghossian's book is the perfect companion&nbsp;to Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion. They should be bundled like&nbsp;an atheist software package to reprogram minds into employing reason&nbsp;instead of faith, science instead of superstition."<br><b>--Michael Shermer, from the foreword to&nbsp;<i>A Manual for Creating Atheists</i></b>"Peter Boghossian's techniques of friendly persuasion are not mine, and maybe I'd be more effective if they were.

Two front doors, two walkways lined with blank slates and grass, two identical signs welcoming customers to the First and Last Page, and a great blue building in the middle, shaped like an old-fashioned barn with a slanted tiled roof and generous rain gutters. Nobody knew how many books were inside that building, not even Molly, the owner. But if you couldn&#x2019;t find it there, they probably hadn&#x2019;t written it down yet.<br><br>The two walkways led to two identical front doors, with straw welcome mats, blue plank floors, and the scent of lilacs and old bindings&#x2014;but then you&#x2019;d see a completely different store, depending which side you entered. With two cash registers, for two separate kinds of money.<br><br>If you entered from the California side, you&#x2019;d see a wall-hanging: women of all ages, shapes, and origins, holding hands and dancing. You&#x2019;d notice the display of the latest books from a variety of small presses that clung to life in Colorado Springs and Santa Fe, from literature and poetry to cultural studies. The shelves closest to the door on the California side included a decent amount of women&#x2019;s and queer studies but also a strong selection of classic literature, going back to Virginia Woolf and Zora Neale Hurston. Plus some brand-new paperbacks.<br><br>If you came in through the American front door, the basic layout would be pretty similar, except for the big painting of the nearby Rocky Mountains. But you might notice more books on religion and some history books with a somewhat more conservative approach. The literary books skewed a bit more toward Faulkner, Thoreau, and Hemingway, not to mention Ayn Rand, and you might find more books of essays about self-reliance and strong families, along with another selection of low-cost paperbacks: thrillers and war novels, including brand-new releases from the big printing plant in Gatlinburg. Romance novels, too.<br><br>Go through either front door and keep walking, and you&#x2019;d find yourself in a maze of shelves, with a plethora of nooks and a bevy of side rooms. Here a cavern of science fiction and fantasy, there a deep alcove of theater books&#x2014;and a huge annex of history and sociology, including a whole wall devoted to explaining the origins of the Great Sundering. Of course, some people did make it all the way from one front door to the other, past the overfed-snake shape of the hallways and the giant central reading room, with a plain red carpet and two beat-down couches in it. But the design of the store encouraged you to stay inside your own reality.<br><br>The exact border between America and California, which elsewhere featured watchtowers and roadblocks, you are now leaving/you are now entering signs, and terrible overpriced souvenir stands, was denoted in the First and Last Page by a tall bookcase of self-help titles about coping with divorce.<br><br>People came from hundreds of miles in either direction, via hydroelectric cars, solarcycles, mecha-horses, and tour buses, to get some book they couldn&#x2019;t live without. You could get electronic books via the Share, of course, but they might be plagued with crowdsourced editing, user-targeted content, random annotations, and sometimes just plain garbage. You might be reading The Federalist Papers on your Gidget and come across a paragraph about rights vs. duties that wasn&#x2019;t there before&#x2014;or, for that matter, a few pages relating to hair cream, because you&#x2019;d been searching on hair cream yesterday. Not to mention, the same book might read completely differently in California than in America. You could only rely on ink and paper (or, for newer books, Peip0r) for consistency, not to mention the whole sensory experience of smelling and touching volumes, turning their pages, bowing their spines.<br><br>Everybody needs books, Molly figured. No matter where they live, how they love, what they believe, whom they want to kill. We all want books. The moment you start thinking of books as some exclusive club, or the loving of books as a high distinction, then you&#x2019;re a bad bookseller.<br><br>Books are the best way to discover what people thought before you were born. And an author is just someone who tried their utmost to make sense of their own mess, and maybe their failure contains a few seeds to help you with yours.<br><br>Sometimes people asked Molly why she didn&#x2019;t simplify it down to one entrance. Force the people from America to talk to the Californians, and vice versa&#x2014;maybe expose one side or the other to some books that might challenge their worldview just a little. And Molly always replied that she had a business to run, and if she managed to keep everyone reading, then that was enough. At the very least, Molly&#x2019;s arrangement kept this the most peaceful outpost on the border, without people gathering on one side to scream at the people on the other.<br><br>Some of those screaming people were old enough to have grown up in the United States of America, but they acted as though these two lands had always been enemies.<br><br>Whichever entrance of the bookstore you went through, the first thing you&#x2019;d notice was probably Phoebe. Rake-thin, coltish, rambunctious, right on the edge of becoming, she ran light enough on her bare feet to avoid ever rattling a single bookcase or dislodging a single volume. You heard Phoebe&#x2019;s laughter before her footsteps. Molly&#x2019;s daughter wore denim overalls and cheap linen blouses most days, or sometimes a floor-length skirt or lacy-hemmed dress, plus plastic bangles and necklaces. She hadn&#x2019;t gotten her ears pierced yet.<br><br>People from both sides of the line loved Phoebe, who was a joyful shriek that you only heard from a long way away, a breath of gladness running through the flowerbeds.<br><br>Molly used to pester Phoebe about getting outdoors to breathe some fresh air&#x2014;because that seemed like something moms were supposed to say, and Molly was paranoid about being a Bad Mother, since she was basically married to a bookstore, albeit one containing a large section of parenting books. But Molly was secretly glad when Phoebe disobeyed her and stayed inside, endlessly reading. Molly hoped Phoebe would always stay shy, that mother and daughter would hunker inside the First and Last Page, side-eyeing the world through thin linen curtains when they weren&#x2019;t reading together.<br><br>Then Phoebe had turned fourteen, and suddenly she was out all the time, and Molly didn&#x2019;t see her for hours. Around that time, Phoebe had unexpectedly grown pretty and lanky, her neck long enough to let her auburn ponytail swing as she ran around with the other kids who lived in the tangle of tree-lined streets on the America side of the line, plus a few kids who snuck across from California. Nobody seriously patrolled this part of the border, and there was one craggy rock pile, like an echo of the looming Rocky Mountains, that you could just scramble over and cross from one country to the other, if you knew the right path.<br><br>Phoebe and her gang of kids, ranging from twelve to fifteen, would go trampling the tall grass near the border on a &#x201c;treasure hunt&#x201d; or setting up an &#x201c;ambush fort&#x201d; in the rocks. Phoebe occasionally caught sight of Molly and turned to wave, before running up the dusty hillside toward Zadie and Mark, who had snuck over from California with canvas backpacks full of random games and junk. Sometimes Phoebe led an entire brigade of kids into the store, pouring cups of water or Molly&#x2019;s homebrewed ginger beer for everyone, and they would all pause and say, &#x201c;Hello, Ms. Carlton,&#x201d; before running outside again.<br><br>Mostly, the kids were just a raucous chorus, as they chased each other with pea guns. There were times when they stayed in the most overgrown area of trees and bracken until way after sundown, until Molly was about to message the other local parents via her Gidget, and then she&#x2019;d glimpse a few specks of light emerging from the claws and twisted limbs. Molly always asked Phoebe what they did in that tiny stand of vegetation, which barely qualified as &#x201c;the woods,&#x201d; and Phoebe always said: Nothing. They just hung out. But Molly imagined those kids under the moonlight, blotted by heavy leaves, and they could be doing anything: drinking, taking drugs, playing kiss-and-tell games.<br><br>Even if Molly had wanted to keep tabs on her daughter, she couldn&#x2019;t leave the bookstore unattended. The bi-national design of the store required at least two people working at all times, one per register, and most of the people Molly hired only lasted a month or two and then had to run home because their families were worried about all the latest hints of another war on the horizon. Every day, another batch of propaganda bubbled up on Molly&#x2019;s Gidget, from both sides, claiming that one country was a crushing theocracy or the other was a godless meat grinder. And meanwhile, you heard rumblings about both countries searching for the last precious dregs of water&#x2014;sometimes actual rumblings, as California sent swarms of robots deep underground. Everybody was holding their breath.<br><br>Molly was working the front counter on the California side, trying as usual not to show any reaction to the people with weird tattoos or with glowing silver threads flowing into their skulls. Everyone knew how eager Californians were to hack their own bodies and brains, from programmable birth control to brain implants that connected them to the Anoth Complex. Molly smiled, made small talk, recommended books based on her uncanny memory for what everybody had been buying&#x2014;in short, she treated everyone like a customer, even the folks who noticed Molly&#x2019;s crucifix and clicked their tongues, because obviously she&#x2019;d been brainwashed into her faith.<br><br>A regular customer named Sander came in, looking for a rare book from the last days of the United States about sustainable farming and animal consciousness, by a woman named Hope Dorrance. For some reason, nobody had ever uploaded this book of essays to the Share. Molly looked in the fancy computer and saw that they had one copy, but when Molly led Sander back to the shelf where it was supposed to be, the book was missing.<br><br>Sander stared at the space where Souls on the Land ought to be, and their pale, round face was full of lines. They had a single tattoo of a butterfly clad in gleaming armor, and the wires rained from the shaved back of their skull. They were some kind of engineer for the Anoth Complex.<br><br>&#x201c;Huh,&#x201d; Molly said. &#x201c;So this is where it ought to be. But I better check if maybe we sold it over on the, uh, other side and somehow didn&#x2019;t log the sale.&#x201d; Sander nodded, and followed Molly until they arrived in America. There, Molly squeezed past Mitch, who was working the register, and dug through a dozen scraps of paper until she found one. &#x201c;Oh. Yeah. Well, darn.&#x201d;<br><br>They had sold their only copy of Souls on the Land to one of their most faithful customers on the America side: a gray-haired woman named Teri Wallace, who went to Molly&#x2019;s church. And Teri was in the store right now, searching for a cookbook. Mitch had just seen her go past. Unfortunately, Teri hated Californians even more than most Americans did. And Sander was the sort of Californian that Teri especially did not appreciate.<br><br>&#x201c;So it looks like we sold it a while back, and we didn&#x2019;t update our inventory, which, uh, does happen,&#x201d; Molly said.<br><br>&#x201c;In essence, this was false advertising.&#x201d; Sander drew upward, with the usual Californian sense of affront the moment anything wasn&#x2019;t perfectly efficient. &#x201c;You told me that the book was available, when in fact you should have known it wasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>Molly had already decided not to tell Sander who had bought the Hope Dorrance, but Teri came back clutching a book of killer salads just as Sander was in mid-rant about the ethics of retail communication. Sander happened to mention Souls on the Land, and Teri&#x2019;s ears pricked up.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I just bought that book,&#x201d; Teri said.<br><br>Sander spun around, smiling, and said, &#x201c;Oh. Pleased to meet you. I&#x2019;m afraid that book you bought is one that had been promised to me. I don&#x2019;t suppose we could work out some kind of arrangement? Perhaps some system of needs-based allocation, because my need for this book is extremely great.&#x201d; Sander was already falling into the hyper-rational, insistent language of a Californian faced with a problem.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Teri said. &#x201c;I bought it. I own it now. It&#x2019;s mine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But,&#x201d; Sander said, &#x201c;there are many ways we could . . . I mean, you could loan it to me, and I could digitize it and return it to you in good condition.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want it in good condition. I want it in the condition it&#x2019;s in now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Molly could see this conversation was about three exchanges away from full-blown unpleasantries. Teri was going to insult Sander, either directly or by getting their pronoun wrong. Sander was going to call Teri stupid, either by implication or outright. Molly could see an easy solution: She could give Teri a bribe&#x2014;a free book or blanket discount&#x2014;in exchange for letting Sander borrow the Hope Dorrance so they could digitize it using special page-turning robots. But this wasn&#x2019;t going to be solved with reason. Not right now, anyway, with the two of them snarling at each other.<br><br>So Molly put on her biggest smile and said, &#x201c;Sander. I just remembered, I had something extra special set aside for you, back in the psychology/philosophy annex. I&#x2019;ve been meaning to give it to you, and it slipped my mind until now. Come on, I&#x2019;ll show you.&#x201d; She tugged gently at Sander&#x2019;s arm and hustled them back into the warren of bookshelves. Sander kept grumbling about Teri&#x2019;s irrational selfishness, until they had left America.<br><br>Molly had no idea what the special book she&#x2019;d been saving for Sander actually was&#x2014;but she figured by the time they got through the Straits of Romance and all the switchbacks of biography, she&#x2019;d think of something.<br><br>Phoebe was having a love triangle. Molly became aware of this in stages, by noticing how all the other kids were together and by overhearing snippets of conversation (despite her best efforts not to eavesdrop).<br><br>Jonathan Brinkfort, the son of the minister at Molly&#x2019;s church, had started following Phoebe around with a hangdog expression, like he&#x2019;d lost one of those kiss-and-dare games and it had left him with gambling debts. Jon was a tall, quiet boy with a handsome square face, who mediated every tiny dispute among the neighborhood kids with a slow gravitas, but Molly had never before seen him lost for words. She had been hand-selling airship adventure books to Jon since he was little.<br><br>And then there was Zadie Kagwa, whose dad was a second-generation immigrant from Uganda with a taste for very old science fiction. Zadie had a fresh tattoo on one shoulder, of a dandelion with seedlings fanning out into the wind, and one string of fiber-optic pearls coming out of her locs. Zadie&#x2019;s own taste in books roamed from science and math, to radical politics, to girls-at-horse-camp novels. Zadie whispered to Phoebe and brought tiny presents from California, like these weird candies with chili peppers in them.</p>
